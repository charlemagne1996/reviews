B8983,['8907271'],  literature the writings of john greenleaf whittier 7 vols macmillan  co this edition of the works of mr whittier is intended at least as to the poems to be complete unless so far as there are hopes that the time  honoured author whose  brown dwarf of eugen  and  one of the signers date only from last year may add some postscripts of pleasant verse to the collection which now contains he says  all that i care to republish and some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself i should have omitted at the request of his publishers mr whittier has in this edition allowed the reappearance though only in an appendix of early poems which for many years he has banished as not worthy of his nameand as to which indeed it is not possible to say that his name will restore them to the favour with which they were received by american readers of sixty years ago when as he apologetically remarks  the standard of criticism was not discouragingly high the publishers object in persuading mr whittier to republish the things that he would rather not have written was  to make the edition so complete and retrospective that students of the poets career will always find the most abundant materials for their purpose and if we are to suppose that mr whittiers readers read not for the sake of his poetry but to give themselves a course of educational study on his career as a poet the appendix may certainly be useful to them tor the excess of juvenile efflorescence and the protraction of its period in mr whittiers case as contrasted with the fact of his nevertheless coming to a fruitage time are shown by the poems in this appendix and their dates to be exceptional and though the phenomenon is easily explainable by the cause mr whittier assigns for the popularity of his verse in its turgid immaturity it offers something for the student of the career to study if he will take the trouble to compare with mr whittiers literary infancy the literary infancies of other writers who earlier or as late as he like him eventually arrived at literary years of discretion but even from this point of view it is difficult to see any sufficient advantage gained to the world by overruling mr whittiers wisely critical judgement of his least meritorious productions the arrangement has however given him the opportunity of dismissing the tedious and unreal attempt in the school of scott  mogg megone which disfigured his former collected editions to the limbo of the appendix and thus increasing the honour to which his riper work entitles him from all critics who appreciate artistic unaffectedness and the grace of sobriety the poems of mr whittiers literary prime vary much in quality but all have at least the strength of manly common sense good taste and direct expression while many possess also either reticent and therefore effective pathos or a certain eager and orderly rush rather perhaps of orator than of poet but instinct with metrical vigour which has characterised some of his most popular pieces his boundaries have not been wide but within them he has been master he has been sure of his purpose and what he purposed he could effect and he has shown an understanding of his limits which is in itself a faculty of no mean order in england his poetry taking it all in all has not met with the wide and somewhat undiscriminating acceptance it has received from his own countrymen and only a few pieces can be named as having become favourites of our general public but we may fairly say that the restriction of the welcome on this side the water is quite as undiscriminating as its liberality on the other side for instance now that every one knows  maud muller why are there comparatively few who are familiar with  telling

the pinetree in her banners tattered field  this is a fine piece of passionate rhetoric and has real fire in it still mr whittiers antislavery poems do not show him at his best as a poet indeed nobodys antislavery poems ever have been truly poems though some rare few have like  the pine  tree been very good metrical speeches the theme would seem on first thoughts just what must have made any man whose heart was hot about it and who could put feelings into verse at all capable of true poetry for that if for nothing else and must have inspired any true poet with dramatic force and lyric passion to make his least words on it immortal but second thoughts explain why the fact has been so much the reverse antislavery was not a theme for a poet it was too abstract too political and above all too argumentative a great poet might with one short drama one lyric one stanza nay one line about some slave who never existed but in his mind and his readers minds have found his way to human hearts then and for all hereafter as long as the english language lasts but there were in the antislavery agitation no poets who could or would write their poems on the slaves side so the antislavery poets were absorbed in the great public question with all its disputatious details they were in the thick of debates and arguments they wrote them with thought of their opponentsto answer to persuade or to attack poems so written may have their influence in a great public controversy but the controversy over their life is gone they are like weapons of an ancient warfareweapons we respect in the museums but that have no purpose in them for our days mrs beecher stowe in her own line of art managed better she used sympathies of human nature that belonged to all times and peoples and produced a novel which was genuinely a novel with the novels power to absorb attention to amuse and to move and which whatever its faults has lost nothing of that power by reason of the slavery question having become obsolete to her the theme does seem to have given inspiration beyond her normal faculty so that this one book of hers her worst as to some glaring bad qualities has in it a something amounting to genius which her other works can by no means parallel her imagination seems to have been aroused by her zeal while the zeal of the poets whirled their imaginations away and left it the only difference between their polemical productions and those of other able rhetoricians that theirs were in verse and had more similes in them much the same has always been the case with poets polemics weean call to mind no verse directly dealing with aay question agitating the public mind catting for any wrong to be righted urging any great measure which has had it in it to aurvive as poetry the success of its cause except mrs brownings  song of the children and that the  song of the children though intended polemically not only had aa influence on the public mind at the time bat stands forth a poem is because mrs browning with the high poets sympathetic instinct went at once forth from herself aad let her pleadings and her reasonings pass into the piteous simplicity of the thoughts and words of the childrenjust as she would have done in fact had their miseries belonged to ancient history or to an imaginary world to take mr whittier at his best as distinctively a poet we must go to his  poems of nature poems subjective and reminiscent and  narrative and legendary poems as is inevitable when a writer tries to classify his collected poems the series overlap and a piece that stands in one series might as fitly or more fitly stand in another  and it is the merit of the beet poems in these three series that they might all lay claim from one point of view or another to belong to the poems of nature  telling the bees  in the  narrative and legendary poems owes its charm to this and its tender implication and tu4 narration of the simple love and simple sorrow here is the place

and occasional we confine our remarks to the pieces that rightfully belong to these headings when we say that this kind of verse is not so favourably appreciated in england as it appears to be iu the united states possibly all our poets too in their private life write verse to each other but if so they except in one or two exceptional instances do not publish it and they are not often called on for odes and hymns at  celebrations  and openings and anniversariesand so much the better the critic always feels regret when he finds the abilities of men with real gifts frittered away upon these politenesses of the prose there is no need to say much it does not compel blame it does not invite praise margaret smiths journal the editor tells his readers presents a tolerably lifelike picture of the past  unfortunately it does not the shorter tales also show that mr whittier has not that gift of vividness of making even transparent unreality seem true till the moment the reader leaves off reading which is specially the novelists the papers in the two other volumes are on  the conflict with slavery on politics and reforms on literary and historic subjects or are brief biographies of men and of books and tributes to contemporariesall of them manifestly contributions to periodical literature they have of course spirit and purpose we marked from one paper only at least a dozen passages quite amazing for inflation mixed metaphor and bad taste passing to another paper we found not one florid sentence the prose works are not dated but the difference in style must be a matter of dates and it may be reasonably inferred that the florid papers belong to the immature period and the better ones be taken as the true standard of mr whittiers prose,unmarked

B8231,['8503672'],  terence mcgowan the irish tenant by g l tottenham smith elder and co the irish question has been done in conventional prose ad nauseam as we noted a few weeks since it has not escaped a record in romantic poetry and here we have it in the form of fanciful fiction we can fancy the halfcontemptuous impatient gesture with which most novel readers would throw this book aside on the mere perusal of its title the author too seems to have had some misgivings as to the reception of his work for he has written a halfapologetic preface to it in which he says notwithstanding its suspicious title i feel myself at liberty i think to assert that this book is not a pamphlet in disguise i am rather presumptuous enough to hope that if any one will read it and if it is as truthful a representation as i believe it to be of existing social relations in ireland it may act in some measure as a corrective of a good deal of that literature for which mr gladstone recently returned thanks and dispel perhaps a few of those erroneous impressions regarding ireland which have been sown broadcast through the kingdom of late by casual and special tourists in the country after this handsome explanation and apology we forgave mr tottenhams audacity in mixing irish politics with light literature and proceeded to read his novel which we may as well say at once we found pleasant and interesting reading the cloven foot peeps out occasionally in rather longwinded discussions of party views between a rigid conservative dowager lady eleanor rochfort and a tory of a somewhat milder type lord shirley which are made the media for talking at if not directly talking of certain great politicians of though present day but this aside there is genuine romance in the story none the less interesting because we have too much reason to assume its foundation in stern fact moreover the picturesque descriptions with which the book abounds and the light genial almost brilliant style in which it is written would go far to make even a heavier mixture of the land question palatable the story is one which has had in times past and possibly has now its counterpart in many districts in ireland that of a kind careless and indulfent landlord idolised by his tenantry who regard im with almost patriarchal veneration he dies and the property heavily encumbered finds a new landlord with different ways to his predecessor rents are raised tenants evicted farms joined the old landmarks removed murderous passions evoked by mercenary greed till the once smiling if not perfect landscape is clouded and bloody with agrarian crime when the tale opens allan rochfort is the proprietor of geraldscourt which his family has held since the founder sir gerald rochfort a distinguished soldier in the reign of elizabeth concerning this gentleman we are told  cromwells celtic remnant had their strongholds in the mountains immediately around and made him continually aware of their existence in many bold and ingenious ways his cattle were houghed and carried off his retainers were murdered he was besieged himself in his own castle and it was a very odd thing if he ever had a crop to his name they were extremely pleasant neighbours these exasperated celts who knew that no one would be foolhardy enough to follow them into their own domains and therefore played off their little amenities upon country gen tiemeuwhom they con sidered as intruders with much the same impunity as they are humanely permitted to enjoy at the present day gradually however the kind treatment of those immediately around the invaders residence began to make itself felt in widening ripples  and as the years passed on and the indifference of long habit began to render the peasantry more acquiescent in the appropriation of their property a more conciliatory demeanour came to be adopted an attachment sprang up between the lord of the soil and his unwilling dependents and the oppressor by degrees became looked upon aa a benefactor successive generations fostered the growing feeling and mutual goodwill and kindness slowly broadened down from precedent to precedent until it reached the enthusiastic devotion which the tenantry of the geraldsoourt estate felt now for allan rochfort their present landlord geraldscourt is mortgaged to the last shilling it will bear and its indolent and thoughtless owner troubles himself as little as possible regarding its j future his tenants pay him as they like and aa j they can his boy that should have been his leir is dead and allan feels less

well off the younger larry is however a goodnatured idle graceless dog who has married and settled in a cabin on a strip of his fathers land as a specimen of the authors humour we quote a description of this latter gentlemans wardrobe your ordinary pauper or beggar has no sentiment of attachment to his rags and allows them to drop off by degrees until he is obliged to beg borrow or steal to replace them the irishman on the contrary understands the philosophy of clothes and furnishes in his nether garments a curious and interesting illustration of the constaut change which is always going on around us in the natural world every seven yean we are told owing to the continual discharge of old particles from our bodies and the constant accretion of new ones we get an entirely new body similarly at certain intervals determined by no fixed law the irishman will be found to change his clothes owing to the continual absorption into their system of black brown blue or grey patches and the gradual discharge of the original foundation so it was with larrythough how many phases he had already passed through or whether the black cloth the yellow corduroy the prey stuff or the brown

time all went on smoothly enough  the leaseholders and what few had had no increase to pay seemed to have been put forward first then there was a movement at the lower end of the room succeeded by an expectant silence as a doggedlooking fellow comes forward fumbling in his pocket for his moneybag this was one whose rent had been raised as the landlord knew when he heard his name  and he felt that the storm was about to break there was a significance in the mans manner which was not to be mistaken  and the hushed stillness behind him and the increased crowd of heads at the doorway were in

this tale an air of vivid reality about its circumstances that invest its unpretentious two volumes with an interest superior to that often excited by larger and more elaborate works of fiction we congratulate mr tottenham on his novel it is not as he says  a pamphlet in disguise  but we defy any reader of intelligence and feeling not to feel the force of the illustrations of irish life and character here presented and their application to s the political events of the present day such a statement a true one of irish affairs cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on english minds and

think twice before calling its attention to a wine that may be a failure at the tremendous moment when the first sip of wine actually pawse our amateurs lips he must on peril of losing the whole of the prestige gained for him by a careful attention to all that has gone before withdraw the glass smartly from his mouth and look down at it as if it had offended him then his glance having gained new

colour and intensity to the early days of the american republic but we recall none of greater charm than barbara ladd and none that brings us into closer intimacy with the homely life of the period the story is picturesque and alive with human interest the characters are drawn vividly and with insight and humour the brothers dr jim and dr john with their long silent love of miss mehetable are delightfully quaint robert gault is an ideal hero within human limits but the most masterly study in the book is the headstrong lovable bewitching rebellious barbara herself it was worth writing and would have been worth reading if it gave us nothing else we can warmly recommend it as one of the few new novels that combine the elements of popularity with good workmanship  i barbara ladd by charles g d roberts constable  co our struggle with the insurgent colonies more than a century and a quarter ago has been the motive of some celebrated as well as merely successful stories the one under notice scarcely belongs to either class the heroine aged fourteen is more of a heroine even to her own family and intimate friends than the reader can understand the whole neighbourhood is   agog  over her small joys and sorrows the author begins with an account of a rather superior sunrise sunsets are a little out of favour it used so often to be  the last rays of the setting sun c now is it the influence of tess it is oftener  the miracle of dawn and so forth the heroine makes her dublt as a runaway at break of day an exit by drowning had been previously attempted but we need not add unsuccessfully before the reader has got far in her story or she far in her morning ramble he feels that enough running away has come off or as it were not come off devoted friends recapture the childor is it the woman it is difficult to say one moment she drums her heels on the waistcoat of a male admirer who carries her like a baby the next her hand is kissed and she is addressed as dear lady that her mother was a southerner is considered a sufficient reason that she should believe herself misunderstood by a northern aunt we had yearned for some show of severity from this connecticut lady but in vain she begins to  understand  her niece almost at once and to join the rest of the society in flattering her to the top of her bent two colossal brothers in their way almost as exasperating as the cheeryble brothers of dickens a maternal uncle a youth of high birth whose political faith differs from that of his ladylove and many others bow before her if the manners and speech of these people are in accord with the time and with one another it is surprising i  barbara ladd by g d roberts constable 6s by this time a novel that deals with the american war of independence must have something striking about it to deserve notice at all in america the subject is probably still of such absorbing interest as to command attention for itself but over here we look for something more in a story than the glorification of a patriotism that ceased to have any point for us in 177g  barbara ladd  opens so well that it suggests the existence of that something more quite half the book that half that deals with the childhood of the heroine is full of promise it is interesting and it has a certain amount of literary feeling but when barbara grows up when the scene of the story is transferred to new york the interest drops into the dreariest commonplace we do not find the very heartless coquetry of the extraordinarily beautiful barbara half so fascinating as the author evidently does and we grow horribly tired of her flashing eyes and her red lips and her wonderful hair and the war details are just like the war details of every other book of the kind families are of course divided against families lovers against lovers it is needless to add that barbara and her accepted lover have placed their sympathies in opposite camps the weakest part of the dook comes perhaps at the end where the construction completely breaks down and the feeblest of conclusions is arrived at in consequence the hero drags himself back to the home of his childhood having been severely wounded in a skirmish and the heroine opportunely goes out in her canoe and sees him fall fainting on the opposite bank of the lake the rest is easy to guess but in case there should be any doubt about what follows we quote the heros impassioned speech on his return to consciousness   listen my lady i will draw sword no more in this uarrel i have given my blood my landsi have given as thought my lovefor a cause already lost for a cause that i felt to be wrong from the day of lexington but whichever side wins i will stay in my own country if my country when it is all over will let me stay when i am well enough to go away love love will you go with me to return when the fighting and the fun cease to our own dear river and our own dear woods   everybody of course knows what happens when the wounded hero talks in this fluent way the moment his wounds have been dressed  barbara ladd by g d roberts  a new england story of the eighteenth century the vivacious young woman whom we first meet as she runs away from her aunts house is so obtrusively modern that we learn with surprise in the third chapter that the date of the story is 17o9 barbara was  an accident in her

emphatically his own and could not possibly be mistaken for any one elses work an anonymous  temple thurston  would be detected at once and though his popularity is a strong incentive to imitation no counterfeit has yet been produced which would deceive the experienced novel reader for a single chapter in a word mr temple thurston has a style he has created a new genre and for all that it appears so easy to copy he has somehow contrived to keep his formula secret as to the merits of the thurstonesque manner there may be two opinions but there can be no question of its popularity mr thurston has invented a new form of entertainment and his circulation proves that the public appreciates it his books are so easy to read that they produce an illusion of being easy to write but in reality the art of being sentimental without being sickly is not so simple as it looks and mr thurston adds to his gift of sentiment a keen eye for beauty in everyday scenes and an untiring capacity for enjoying life everything that is beautiful appeals to him and he can find beauty in much that to most people appears trivial or coramonplace the subtitle of mr thurstons new book  the love story of an ugly man is characteristic of his method for really there is no reason why the hero should have been more than ordiiarily plain except to excite the readers sentimental pity indeed mr thurston makes an unnecessary demand on the readers credulity whenhe suggests that the wealthy mr bellairs was so ugly that his ugliness made him repellent to women especially when the course of the story makes it clear that all the nice women in the book were not repelled by it at all if we were disposed to be critical we might complain that mfr thurston begins by claiming our sympathy for his hero under false pretences but mr thurston never gives the reader time to be critical lie sweeps on with such buoyant good spirits and frank enjoyment of natural beauty that we are hypnotised into aclpting his prenisses without demur  the garden of resurrection  has not the charm of  the city of beautiful nonsense and it contains one needlessly painful incident but it is very good thurston for all that  the garden o remurrection by e temple thurston chapman  hall in his latest novel mr temple thurston has evidently set forth with a steadfast resolve to be whimsical and fantastic at all hazards

preposterous story told with some charm and agility together with a certain firmness of touch that reminds us of the authors earlier and less sentimental work his secession from the real to the aggressively pretty does not please us although it may make for an increase in general popularity  the garden of resurrection by e temple thurston i chapman and hall 6s it seems to us that bellwattlea curious nickname for a very nice ladywas quite right when she told mr bellairs that he was morbid about his ugliness although he may have been badly pockmarked and perhaps not originally endowed with a greek perfection of feature it was hardly necessary for him to wander so disconsolately through life believing himself a monster of unattractiveness he was really a charming gentleman in a mournful and at times slightly ridiculous way mr thurston has succeeded with great neatness in doing that rather difficult thing which is to make his hero tell his own story and remain the only person in or out of it who is ignorant of his attractions in mr bellairs quixotic venture of going to ireland to warn a helpless young girl whom a cad had brought over from dominica to marry and imprisoned in the house of his two shedragons of aunts we have nothing to lament exc3ept that he did not carry it out with more dash he failed to make her believe his warning and received as thanks a promise that the fair dominican would pray never to look upon him again this upset mr bellairs very much as he was already in love with her we think mr thurston insists a little too much on his hopelessness of inspiring a reciprocal passion mr bellairs who had longed so earnestly for romance scarcely realised it when it came but he acted entirely in character and that is the main thing in a sentimental romance just as much as in a bloodandiron work of realism we were genuinely pleased when he received his final reward mr thurston possesses that derided but not inestimable gift of painting a man who is a gentleman in all he does he is also a writer of a rare studiousness incapable of bad grammar and scorning an ugly cadence he is hardly robust enough to move us very deeply but he has in a marked degree the gift of being entirely readable we hesitate to say that he has charm because that word has been so cheapened by being bestowed where it is not deserved but if mr thurston does not object to sharing the quality with a good many rather questionable folk we cannot withhold it from him,unmarked

amusing volumes upon the public with irresistible energy indicative we sincerely hope of renewed health wre think that lu general to doctrinate with tales of fiction upon any of the various passions that agitate for good or evil the human breast is very prejudicial to moral science the poetic mind may well truly and beautifully illustrate them in all their workings but it is one thing to paint elegantly and forcibly another to treat of thc mind and its various imperfections scientifically and satisfactorily the  lutherans  is written with the avowed purpose to prove that the most besotted bigotry wrapped up in insane pride aud stained with innocent blood is not inconsistent with nay may spring from motives altogether pure and virtuousin fact written to correct a mistake of the authors entertained in his young and generous days  that malice was an essential ingredient of bigotry  for he adds  i now think that it bigotry may be a very honest habit with which pride and egotism have much more to do than the acrid quality malice 1 had once supposed all this may be true but a tale is not the kind of argument to prove it our idea of an act of cruelty is that there is malice in whatever rejoices in the pain of others or conspires to bring about such enjoyment we well know that an auto da fe was more sought for and enjoyed in the palmy days of the inquisition than all the ferocious pleasures of the bullfight but we must not ourselves begin to be didactic when we get mr gaits works before us they always afford us so much for reflection and generally for admiration that we are apt to be tempted into prolixity putting aside the doctrine of the  lutherans we proceed to inform the reader that the tale is excellent the different phases of passion are extremely well described and the interest is actually absorbing were it condensed into five acts it would form an excellent drama the language when the occasion requires the expression of emotion is energetic to a startling degree this tale occupies the half of three volumes and it well deserves the space  the dean of guild the next story in succession is a burlesque clumsy and at the same time droll and humorousa sort of elderly peter simple he the dean takes his ignorance his scotch selfinterestedness and his tomfoolery into the presence of the three greatest characters of the day the duke of wellington earl grey and lord brougham with admirable tumhommie yet upon the whole the thing somehow clashes upon our sense of propriety  and the tory hankering not that we dislike the tories seems to twist the sketch into something like ungainliness there is a coveit attempt to make the same tories the possessors of all that is magnanimous in feeling and elegant and fashionable in taste how much better we should like mr galt if he would write upon the broad principles of human nature and not upon those of a subjected party  the black pirate  is a failure on that point we are dictatorial if we cannot expunge it from the book we will endeavour to do it from our memories  and the  greenwich pensioner  is really a maimed object post captains dont take apprentices that have not served their time out of ships and make them captains of thc faretop upon stepping on board  this objection may be looked upon as technical yet there is not the fresh smell of the sea upon the narrative lt may please the shore going folks with a touch here and there of the elegant in writing but it wont do  with the sailors the  lombards  is a sketch simply descriptive and necessary to be read by all those

a pleasant flowergarden ns the space occupied hythe jaunt the  craniologists  is a fearful tale and tends very much to subvert thc very conclusions that mr galt wishes to draw from it whether man be an agent or au instrument onlythough it is really un awful consideration in morals aud religionis of no consequence in social policy  for if one mau has the organ of destructiveness so fully developed that his murders are the inevitable consequences of his formation aud ho is no longer a free agent so the organs of caution are equally expanded in the rest of society aud they will as inevitably hang

a pleasure in the exercise of any power of whose possession we are conscious that nothing claims more continual selfwatchfulness on the part of the novelist than the propensity unduly to indulge his peculiar talent at the expense of that variety which he who assumes to depict the world as it is never should lose sight of mrs grey has fallen into this common error she knows where her strength lies and she constructs all her plots so as to afford the most ample oppor tunities for its exercise  she fills her fictions with scenes of sor row  she is impatient of the smiling pictures which neverthe less are necessary for the introduction of her sombre ones she glides over them with speed and almost with carelessness until she arrives at the pathetic part of her story then she rejoices in her conscious power  her eyes brighten  thoughts throng thick and fast her pen traces them in bold characters she analyses the feelings lays bare every anguished nerve and to use an expressive term piles up the agony  with a skill that rarely fails to move the hardest heart and draw tears from the manliest eye admirably as this is done it is a fault that there is too much of it not only are all her novels of the sombre hue but there is more of painful picturing in each than can be approved by a critical judgment we admit the beauty of a great deal of this painting the exciting interest of the scenes the ability with which they are constructed and the eloquencewithwhich they are described  but there is alimit to the claims of the novelist upon our feelingstouch them but do not harrow them it must be remembered that it is onliv ideal sorrows with which we love to sympathize the sight of real suffering gives us pain nul the skill of the novelist is shown in conducting the reader to the point where the ideal may be excited to the ntmost stretch of emotion without tres l passing upon the realms of the real and producing pain or upon the cloudland of the unnaitural and toppling down the whole fabric fancy had reared airs glay certainly errs in stretching emotion too far and converting a  pleasing pain into a veritable anguish  and the impression whichi her novels leave behind them is that with which we remember somne terrible sorrow it has been our fate to witness in real life the fault for such it is may be readily amended for it grows out of her very excellence and we name it because it would be pity that so much real genius should not seek to be as perfect ai possible the gamblers w fife exhibits this fault together with all the excellences of its predecessors it

attain them at all the name of its writer first as that of a woman and secondly as that of a popular  novelist will long keep it out of the hands of those  grave and reverend signors who are the chief dispensers of that reputation which they cannot compass for themselves and who till they allow mrs gore to convince them of the fact by such books as the bankers wife will never be satisfied that a woman has been gifted with faculties of observing and setting forth the features of our common nature for the mingled delight and benefit of all for which they may look in vain among their own lordly sex the truth is that the bankers wife should have been written by a man or it should have been left possible by an anonymous titlepage to suppose it so written it would then have passed for the most masterly and instructive exposition that  ever put on paper of that lucrelust which is the most fatal and besetting vice of high civilization and which half neutralises all the virtues of that conditionits aarons rod which however swallows up all the other vices of our time only to disgorge them again in a more loathsome form than they possessed before of this  monster vice of our daythe vilest in its origin yet the most vast and all pervading in its effects mrs gore has here drawn a picture more moving and impressive to the moral sense than the loftiest fiction of old romance or the most soulsubduing dream of modern  sentiment  yet more true to the damning facts that daily beset the hearths and homes of every one of us than the most dry of ancient  chronicles or the most popular

gravities are weighty sterling and stamped with the impresses of moral and social truth if  the bankers wife is perhaps the most valuable and im portant contribution its accomplished author has yet made to that inestimable portion of our contemporary literature which aims at making its readers happier by making them wiser and better it is certainly inferior to none among the brilliant company of its predecessors in those inexhaustible powers of entertainment in which this remarkable writer yields to none of her living rivals and to a very few dead ones  the bankers wife is as we have

of all times her novel besides being what all fiction should beentertaining and recreativecontains much thought fitting for consideration today in fact we may credit her not only with having fulfilled the purpose of a novel but also with having produced at the same time a novel with a purpose to say that she had accomplished both things satisfactorily would be to number the book among the classics and that we cannot do for after gladly bestowing so much of appreciation we must unburden ourselves of our main criticism and then proceed to the consideration of her work in some detail her novel will accomplish its purpose we believe in widening the outlook of the average novelreader but to our mind in addition to other faults she has omitted the pith of the matter had she more plainly analysed the nature of the soil from which the roots of the tragedy drew their nourishment it would have been more helpful as she makes one of her characters say  causes are the things to attack not effects she does in fact inform us that the feet of her wingless victory were clay in so far as her motive power was largely the spirit of revenge on those who were responsible for the sufferings of the poor she had the intellect which  kims the surface it is reserved for the spirit whose advances she had slighted to plumb the depths she had taken her fate into her own hands when she preferred intellectual ascendancy to spiritual enlightenment but the whole setting is in a clay soil impervious to light and air the matter of the girls birth is wrapped in secrecy no less foolish than is usual in such cases the secrecy was as much a matter of the conventions as was the luxury with which even the authors best characters surrounded themselves while bemoaning the lot of the poor in not having more of the worlds goods forgetting at the same time how uneconomically they indulged themselves in superabundance the authors 4 big  man closes a sumptuous repast with what would have been blasphemous prayer had he been really big enough to understand the most elementary economy the income which he spent on himself must have been many times more than the average one of 222 for a man and his wife and three children we have no wish to be thought extremists to allow him but the average income would probably have quenched entirely his utility it is the authors blindness to the awful responsibility of her hero that we deplore the authors conception of the world is obviously that of a place where the intolerableness of conditions must be mitigated with the object of its becoming as efficient a school as possible for fitting its pupils for a heaven hereafter and else where in other words the author does not consider that the ideal of heaven on earth is ever likely to come within the range of practical politics the fact that we do not agree with her detracts not a whit from the value o4 the work considered from the authors own point of view and so from that point we will consider it the heroine possesses as did adnam the hero of 4 adnams orchard to which the book is the sequel in a literal sense if not in that usual in fictionan overabundance of excellence which

she awaits the return of her lover the dukes son her marriage with whom she looks upon as the copingstone of the design by which she will accomplish her object of freeing the lace trade from the sweating conditions imposed on it by the profiteering middlemen meanwhile the duke lavishes wealth and caresses on her and pajrs her clandestine visits late at nightuntil at last the heroine awakens to the fact that scandal is busy with her name at once she believes that there is truth in the rumour which assigns discreditable motives to the dukes attentions in consequence she consents to marry the son without the fathers knowledge and immediately after is made aware that she is the dukes lovechild how the knot is cut we prefer to leave the reader to find out lest this which is to our mind a greater improbability than many which have preceded it should deter any one from the perusal of what after all is a novel far better worth reading than many based upon more likely happenings having very briefly outlined the plot we must allude to some of the admirable characterization there are delineations of the good and bad sides of society which are worthy to be mentioned along with the great names of thackeray and meredith the old lordly reprobate and his parasitic tailors model are two instances and not far behind these are the galaxy of coarseminded women on the other hand we have the princess who betrays her teutonic blood to a degree which will hardly be acceptable today but she is nevertheless a true and lovable presentment the touches with which character are delineated are excellent throughout but we can refer only to a few there ia the solicitorwho was so obviously a man who did not receive orders but was instructedwith his twitching nose reminiscent of a rabbit lady ami an epitome of her caste in all time she felt secure in the established order of good and evil considered that if there were people not equally wellsatisfied with things as they are those people were in the wrong and must be brought to heel and viewing the process from the height of a position whence unpleasant details were not visible to the naked eye she indignantly set aside as impertinent any difference of opinion on the subject that might reach her and was not tobe warned  then the duke her husband he might with justice have called himself a busy man and such business as his has its own importance many lives would have been disarranged and much inconvenience entailed had he neglected it but it was the business of a system of a great machine which ho had not set in motion and could not control it controlled him he was the tool of a machine which was working with results that he knew to be bad in many ways in great measure an ineffectual machine into the defective parts of which he meant to look but never did to any purpose besides his part in the working of the machine was obligatory and obligatory work is not soulsatisfying as an object in life peculiar to himself would have been how he found his real object in life we shall leave readers to discover for themselves some of the traits depicted are easily fitted to people well known a few years ago  but if they have been lifted from life they have been so mixed up as to render them void of any offence occasionally the characters appear to have got out of hand and we like them better freed of the authors control but they appear later to be ruthlessly subjugated to conform with the exigencies of the plot in an age when there is so much more writing and talking than thinking the novel strikes us as overlong towards the end and yet one cannot suggest any of the 650 pages which can safely be skipped,unmarked

amused by any book of its class and certainly by not one of our own day the reader will gain a very aldequate notion of the peculiar nature of miss pardocs book and certainly not an exaggerated one as regards its merits and its powers of entertainment when we state that it is a sort of new arabian nightswith all the oriental tone and imagery of those fascinating fictionsall their rich and wild spirit of romance all their ingenuity and fertility of invention and incident but with one exception wanting that supernatural machinery which we are by no means sure is not the defect rather than the inerit of those still charming tales certain we are that when an equally exciting and attractive result can be obtained without wuch machinery and by circumstances probable to thinking and arrangements compatible with belief and  the romance of the harem by miss pardoe common sens the ultimate effect must be stronger and the merit bf the writer of a rarer at least if not a higher grade and such we venture to sy is the case in miss pardoes  romance of the harem there is for instance nothing in the arabian nights with their genui and perii and all their other is in number arguslike to boot that is more strange stirring and wondermoving than the story of the diamond merchant in these volumesnothing till the mystery is explained more unaccountable by any but supernatural agency than the seven doors and so of other of the stories it as true miss pardoe assures us that these exceedingly clever lively and amusing fictions  are genuine tales related by the professional alassaldjhes or storytellers of the fast in the harems of the wealthy turks during seasons of festivity but we must beg leave to doubt the validity of this modest avowal except in so far as relates to the groundwork of the several stories the superstructureincluding the sentiment imagery and passion and frequently the poetical spirit which pervades the taleand above all thle artistlike putting together of the parts and dovetailing them into one fair anrd consistent wholethe merit of all these we are confident belong to the fair and gifted lady who has now presented us with tile stories in an english attireenglish yet most appropriately ornamented and enriched with the jewels the flowers and the perfuimes of tile east nothing can be more pretty and piquant than the slight but shining web of

must not neglect to nmention that interspersed through these vo lumes are many really exquisite lyrical effusions superior and it is no mean praise to any that we have yet seen from the pen of this lady and so full at once of passion and poetical feeling as to give proniso that the  aching void recently made in our poetical literature by a late melancholy event may at no distant day be filled at

tribe of indians who besiege them upon it their chief the terrible  red hand is not unknown to us also speaking as children we should say that the captain makes up his tale as he goes along with so many exclamations and insignificant incidents that the story is delayed to our great impatience the captain indulges in terribly fine words and fine writing who ever speaking the language of men talked thus the encarmined blossom of the bignonia to me a symbol of the sweetest sentiment i had carefully preserved in a glass i had placed it on the dressingtable of my chamber with its peduncle immersed in water lovers male and female have in all ages we suppose put cherished flowers in water but they would scarcely recognise the familiar instinct under such wonderful terms lovers may and do talk a great deal of nonsense no doubt but a young man might record his preference of a blonde beauty in less stilted language there was another contrast that had at this time an influence on my hearts inclinings to an eye fatigued with dwelling long and continuously on the dark complexions of the south the olivine hue of azec and iberian skins there was a relief in the radiance of this carmined blonde c but we would have forgiven all that if the progress of though story had not been slackened to allow whole ages of this sort of writing to find a place we also complain that the author who although many miles distant could know and tell us all that passed in the secret interview between the mormon apostle and huhman holt the father of the two heroines also what passed in the glade of the forest and the despair of the young hunter in his solitude never  tells us a word about how marian went away with the mormon nor how she discovered his villainy nor how she escaped from him nor how she fell under the protection of walker the good indian we are indeed told something about his finding her tied to a tree but so confusedly and vaguely that ordinary readers will never make it out the  secret by which stebbins the mormon held the father of lillian and marian in his power is never properly disclosed the whole story is diffuse in unnecessary places and most unsatisfactorily huddled up and hurried over when it comes to pointe of vital interest captain main reid is more successful in his shorter and less ambitious stories when he keeps to the facts and does not go off into nonsense about feelings and sentiment,unmarked

achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born that he has already obtained the position of a classic and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time he has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood the collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes the characters he has invented would almost people a town and we might well excuse an author who has done so much if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time but mr dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having outwritten himselfl his fancy his pathos his hmour his wonderful powers of observation his picturesqueness and his versatility are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago in some respects they are seen to still greater advantage the energy of youth yet remains but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years not that we mean to say mr dickenshas outgrown his faults they are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard a certain extr

affectd the development of two or three of the chief characters theind explanation is a disappointment the whole plot in which the deceased harmon boffin wegg and john rokeemith are concerned is wild and fantastic wanting in reality and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story mr dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection for in the very interesting  postscript in lieu of preface which he has appended to the second volume he says there is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact therefore i note here though it may not be at al necessay that there are hundreds of will cases as they are called far more remarkable than that fancied in this book and that the stores of the prerogative office teem with instances of testators who have made changed contradicted hidden forgotten left cancelled and leftuncancelled each many more wills than were ever made by the elder mr harmon of harmony jail we do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact and it is not to the terms of mr harmons will that we object but to the circumstances flowing from that source that the son john harmon known through the greater part of the book as john rokesmith should come baok to gland under the circunstances related should disappear

her we venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up the termination of mr dickenss novels is often hurried and such is the case in the present instance the complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process but is so to speak roughly tonne open and even before we are half through the book the mystery concerning john rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner young rokesmith or harmon tells himself his own previous history in a sort of mental soliloquy in which a long series of events is minutely narrated evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader it is surprising that so experienced a romancewriter as mr dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design yet notwithstanding these defects which we have pointed out with the greater freedom because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic the story of  our mutual friend is interesting for its own sake even apart from its treatment which we need not say is that of a master if we except these points already objected to we repeat what we said at the commencementthat in conception and evolution of character and in power of writing this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw considered on artistic grounds are eugene wrayburn lizzie hexam bradley headstone and bella wilfer the first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature originally noble degenerating under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness into a laughing indifference to all things worthyinto a gay and sportive disbelief in itself in manhood in womanhood and in the world from first to last the conception is wonderfully developed and the change that is afterwards wrought in eugenes disposition is worked out without the smallest violence in strong contrast with the goodnatured levity of wrayburn is the stern selfcontained narrow yet within its contracted and mechanical limits earnest nature of bradley headstone the selfeducated schoolmaster liue hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact she is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can getdead bodies among the restand who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess the girl  however is a fine sensitive being handsome and of a deep tender nature and when eugene wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver he takes an interest in her fate and has her educated his interest deepens into love yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage bradley headstone also is in love with lizzie and the way in which his impassive artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love jealousy and some pungent taunts which wrayburn gaily flings at him is exhibited by mr dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness the transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark haggard selftormenting evil genius per tually dogging the steps of eugene wrayburn and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river is one of the finest things in fiction bradley headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest and we are peruaded of the profoundest truth natures like his originally cold and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of selfcontrol mr dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of bradley headstones wrath in the attempted murder of eugene all the preparations for that at and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions are managed in mr dickenss highest style and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness we are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake of nature to which novelists should be superior that this carcter is sensational  but the genius that could conceive it has dothilg to fear from such objectors very touching and beautifsl the character of lizzie hexam but probably the greatest favourite in the book will beor rather is alreadybella wilfer she is evidently a pet of the authors and she will long r m the darling of half the households of england and america pererse petulant wil wrongheaded not a little inclined at first to be selfish and aneyloving she is yet a bewitching little creare and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak they are so numerous but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of betty higden and little johnny her gre andchild that the poor old creatures pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from mr dickens in the final words from which we have already quoted a declaration of his views on the present administration of the poor laws  in my social experiences since mrs betty higden came upon the scene and left it i have found circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the poor law my friend m1r bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and i have been called upon to admit that i would give poor law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow patting this nonsense aside i have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some union houses the other admitting that there are such pcor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do the records in our newspapers the late exposure by the lancet and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences but that my view of the poor law may not be amk or misrepresented i will state it i believe there has been in england since the days of the stuarts no law so often infimously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised in the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanityand known language could say no more of their lawlessnes we must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls dressmaker fantastic and semipoetical yet with a deep instinct of truth her drunken fathera sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein mr dickens is quite unrivalled bellas father a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature the podsnaps and veneerings and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers male and female by whom they are surroundedportraits admirable for the social satire they embody rogue riderhood and some of the other hangerson about the river we might almost mention the river itself as a character it plays a most important part in the story and always with great picturesqueness we cannot refain ere we conclude from referring once more to the postscript for the sake of its allusion to an event in whidh at the time we were all deeply interested on friday the 9th of june in the present year mr and do

deepens and embitter  our mutual friend by charles dickens with illustrations by marcus stone 2 vols chapman  hall a new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture or of qualification for a simple yet serious reason those who with understanding as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise have followed mr dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him carelesswhether as concerns his art his public or himself as little have they spoilt or dimmed or turned aside his quick sympathies his power of minute observation his keen desire to advocate what he deems right his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success the boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture but may he not ponder too long and oversolicitously  this question we fancy may be asked with respect to  our mutual friend only the other day ita author gave us that french story of little bebelle one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with sternes shandyisms only yesterday out of a dingy street in the strand from no more promising place than a lodginghouse the artist by a touch brought to light a homely loving fellowcreature worthy to  sit above the salt among the best of the best mrs lirriperas real  a being of the mind  as mr pickwick as mrs gamp as the micaivbersas any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist whom we know intimately in all their strength and weakness and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words if therefore we say that during its course of fragmentary publication  our mutual friend has raised more question than certain of its predecessors the circumstance arises from the nature of the story and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion none of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale it would be wasted labour to detail or analyse a chain of events which every one has already handled enough to state our conviction that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links from the first number it was evident to us that the murdered john harmon was not murdered but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will for the purpose of testing her real nature the circumstances of the deed which led to his shipmate radfoot being mistaken for and murdered with himself are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity some incompleteness referable to partial recollection may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelists partmay belong to the nature of the catastrophe but it produces an impression of uncertainty then again the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises which bear unfavourably on some of the characters we fancy the conversion of bella wilfer the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister to be somewhat too suddeneven though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing mr boffin this avarice again however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared has of necessity implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched the honest truthful boffin of the mounds whose simple rightmindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of bella the oddlydesignated bride ofthe great fortune but his inability to carry such a longdrawn piece of subtle comedy through we beg respectfully to our great novel ist to question and we are satisfied that bo greathearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever or any desire to lead on a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with wegg after the discovery of old harmons second mil in the house of the anatomical curiositymonger that which belongs and befits a detective policeman apt at disguises as mr bucket of nevertobeforgotten memory sits ill on an honest ignorant affectionate creature such as he is and though we love mrs boffin the comfortable and instinctivelydelicate woman one of mr dickenss most genial creations with all our hearts we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance truth and nature are here strained in subservience to the requirements of literary art we fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story harmon its hero is by his position betwixt light and dark inevitably partially effaced bella the coquetish daughter of mrs wilfer the stupendous is capitally touched in the chameleon hues of her character and royally righted at last but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring then lizzie hexam though not precisely a sketch has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the readers interest lastly we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy humble affectionate and beneficent as riah the hebrew on any grounds of compact obligation or sophistry lending himself one hour after it was known to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as fledgeby the usurer the meanest creature this is saying much as yet created by the hand that painted the moneylenders in  nickleby and brats and kroolc and fagin and uriah heep the explanation made by him at last to the little weird dolls dressmaker shows us that mr dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation which is insufficient to convince us we cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness somewhat similar in miss edgeworths  ormonda tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom  every man has his hand thus much by way of qualificationor call it speculation ratherconcerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without stop let or hindrance on returning to the characters that of bradley headstone the schoolmaster dogged sensual unreadyhis tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position takes the foremost place among them as an original conception frightfully though he suffers even though when he confronts wrayburn his pococurante rival there is a show of reason and of championship on his side there is

but when talking of dinners in our mutual friend we nuit not forget the most  incomparable dinner of all that of the newly  married couple bella and john at greenwich for the sake of the sentimental

marked by that attitude and occupation enough then has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded and to prove that on its being read and read again every lover of types of human character every student of art in fiction every man who has  humour in his soul will find each and all enjoyment if as regards broad outline there are former stories by mr dickens which we preferif among his tales we rank the highest  david copperfield which includes so to say neither plot nor surpriseour mutual friend must be signalised for an accumulation of fine exact characteristic detail such as would suffice to set up in trade for life a score of the novelspinners wno give us situations without motives scenes without characters words without thoughts and the dialogue not of real life but of melodrama  the literary examiner our mutual friend by charles dickens with illus trations by marcus stone in two volumes chapman and hall latinised races accuse english writers of a disregard of unity in works of art and yet there is no great english work of imagination that does not recognise it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action we rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time and although we recognise even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot but a wellharmonized relation of all parts to one central thought ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based every great english work of imagination every good work of art all the world over is as it were a crystallisation of thought about some one central idea nowhere perhaps is the sense of this true unity so perfectly shown as in the literature of england in shakespeare grave or gay it is distinctly seen every turn of the light trifling in loves labours lost every character of the play blends with the rest in a poets graceful jest over the taste of his day for idle ornament in the plot nothing is done all the ingenious rhyming of the courtiers agrees with the state of don armado with the j brave outside who being called upon to strip to his shirt and fight owns that he has not a shirt to his back under all his bravery in the merchant of venice the play crystallises round the central thought of the relation between justice and mercy law and gospel in king lear earthly sovereignty breaks like a bubble on the wind as it flies through the stir of the grand forces of nature in julius casar the central thought is the problem of government the supreme sovereignty of caesar the philosophical republicanism of brutus the selfseeking republicanism of cassius and all other parts of the play show as it were the different faces of the crystal of which all parts have their harmonious relation to the single point of thought if we turn from shakespeare to fielding in tom jones broad as the canvas is on which that work is painted and crowded as it is with various incident there also we find every detail tending to ono centre the idea of the relation of man to society jones and biifil are types of the two opposite halves of the social world jones faulty but honest his faults open and incurring blame biifil keeping the faults of a worse nature secret giving a fair show to the worst acts and escaping blame in the relation of man with society open truth is contrasted with false seemiog and the episode of the old man of the hill is contrived to provide for the middle case of the man who cuts the knot of tiie social problem by avoiding conversation with his fellows mr dickens invariably fulfils in his novels this condition of deep seated unity which has been always recognised in english art all readers can feel that he does so and some readers who have paid little attention to good literature have raised thereupon arguments upon the propriety or impropriety of  writing with a purpose as tf any thing worth reading anything worth seeing anything worth hearing were ever produced or uttered without the purpose to express a distinct individual meaning of some sort there must be in every good novel play or poem one true thought for the mainspring that keeps all ita wheels in action and we must start from the mainspring if we would trace properly the movement of the works in this novel of our mutual friend the argument is of the soul of life smong the fictions of society we are shown in the first chapter lizzie hexam a truehearted girl in a position as degraded as imagination can conceive without stain to her inner purity she is bringing a pure heart to a revolting way of life ber father supports a wretched home among scum of the riverside by fishing for drowned men in this girl chiefly but not in her only we are as the story grows to see the radiance of the aoul of life we turn from her and the deep social degradation of her outward life at onoe in the second chapter to the other side of the books argument the fictions of society these are typified throughout by the friends collected round the dinnertable of the veneering the veneering themselves have their root in nothing being social jonahs

sense of the reality of the great soul of life within the bounds thus marked for the elaboration of though main idea there is everywhere the same essential unity with the liveliest variety of detail there is a great heap of money in the centre of the story made out of dust hy a dustman and treated as a dustheap in comparison with human truth and tender graces of the mind there is a bella wilfer whose character at every period full of light and shade is shown also in process of developmentour literature does not contain a happier study of light girlish grace advancing with no loss of charms into a pure womanly earnestness bella when young believes that she is sordid she has come out of a mean home into the daily relish of what wealth can buy is guest and friend of mr and mrs boffin social nobodies who happen for a time to sit on the gold heap with homely honest hearts that love of gold can never spoil then the boffins join with bellas lover to whom really all the gold belongs in plot for the girls education and the fetching out of the true soul of life known to be in her boffin covers himself with gloryand much mystifies the reader of the novel by appearing in the character of a man spoilt by wealth and turned into a greedy miser everybody knows how the story runs and so we need not describe at length or quote any of its passages we would only show that in this central plot also of our mutual friend as in the outlying incidents connected with it the inner thought of the book ia still the same is of the soul of life greater than all the fictions of society to this design belongs the sharp contrasting of such characters as mr and mrs boffin and mr and mrs lammle the story of the strong heart of betty higden who showed qualities of heroism in avoidance of the workhouse  the weak intellect with malice and greedy cunning in fledgeby the weaker intellect with love and the tender spirit of selfsacrifice in sloppy how full of a quaint generous humour again is the sketch of the dolls dressmaker little miss wren with her broken back and feeble frame her precocious wit sharpened by trouble in which the spirit of childhood casts its golden threads across the dull woof of her life of care and whose kindliness is at times touched with a malice as of childish playfulness familiar with bitter years of trouble nobody who reads this book as a whole can fail to be struck with the ingenious arrangement and skilfnl conduct of the story bead piecemeal it was satisfactory only to those who had faith in their author the secret of mr boffins little plot is so well kept that while it was in action they who believed their old friend to be shown to them ss really spoilt by wealth believed unwillingly and sometimes may have rashly supposed that here the masters hand had lost its cunning in fact if we look back to those scenes in which mr boffin enacted the part of a miser we shall be surprised to see how skilfully and freely the novelist scattered what with the key to it all in our possession we see clearly enough to be indications of the true state of the case the wealth of wit poured over all the pages of this book would be an intellectual harmons estate large enough to set on horseback every wegg of a literary gentleman with a wooden head we may say if we will that here we like and there we dont like any character or passage but far above desire to criticise by the small way of personal comparison between our individual tastes and opinions and those bf our author is the keen enjoyment of bis genius and after all there is the strictest justice in the heartiest appreciation of a liveliness of fancy that spends all its gaiety in quickening the honest sympathies of life of a pathos that derives ita strength from a firm hold on the realities of life a perception of character that seizes accurately types of men presents vividly their distinctive characters and all tinged with the observers humour that is to say with his own

grasp and refinement ofthe people it embraces no less than the whole round of their moral existence and throws ti trong light on their institution their habits their present capabilities and their future prospects thus thc declining literature of the 9 iealled silver age of latinity might have been tiken as a sign of approaching disorganization quite as trustworthy as that set forth in the pages of tacitus thus too the french literati ie of the eighteenth century so far foreshadowed tin coming revolution that it has since been itiolilily reckoned thc main cause of that catastrophe the literature of the fifteenth century we need not say was still more intimately connected with the changes going forward in the religious and political opinions of the great kuropean community everything indeed in connexion with literature is signiliciint the style the subjects the pervading spirit the moral consideration and even the pecuniary value are each the exponents of some peculiarity ia a nations condition exercising an influence on the destinies of the people hy the word morals is to be understood in this instance the whole range of habits political social and even material so that in many respects literature to be thoroughly understood must be studied out of itself in this us in iilinost all moral questions mankind are tinapes of their analytic habits  the intellectual man has been studied apart from the material a code of criticism has lieen established as available in all times aud under all circumstances and one common procrustean bed of t iste has been applied to the literature of all ciiintries it is not however by such a standard that the productions of a national mind cm be accurately valued the existing state of literature at any moment is a fact dependant on the whole circumstances of the moment on llie actual developeinent of the entire civilization with all thc external agencies by which it is at once excited and modified considering merely the canons of criticism the prevailing state of education the current acquaintance with rhetoric with the principles ol the sublime and beautiful or in one word with the si iencc and the art of composition it would he difficult to point out any vast difference between the actual generation of english writers and that which immediately preceded them  and yet the differences which distinguish their respective productions are many and salient the causes of such difference must be sought beyond the ordinary range of criticism and it will not lo lo talk of the decline of taste of genius ik ing at a discount or of a perverse tendency of writers to neglect those models and rules of art which made the fame or fortune of their predecessors of the changes which have taken place and ure still going on in the literature of our own countryand more especially agermane to the article before us in its fictitious narrativethe greater part in our opinion depends upon corresponding changes going forward in society itself lt is with novels as with the legitimate drama in both instances the audiences have changed and managers and publishers in their modern sub stitutions are following rather than leading the public taste to analyse these changes and to enumerate all the conditions out ol which they arise would be impossible within the compass assignable to a single article one of the most remarkable and pervading is the wider spread of literature and the consequent demand for inferior articles it is no longer the welleducated man of the world the philosopher or the studentthe naturally refined or the artificially polishedwho creates the demand and who consequently determines the fortunes of a new publication the public now addressed is of lower qualifications and the author cheerfully accommodates himself to a circumstance which spares him an infinity of labour and thought one immediate consequence is that no very high order ol mind being necessary for gauging the public intelligence the publisher becomes a better judge of the wants of his customers than the author if the author innot himself a mere tradesman  and it accordingly rests willi the publisher to determine the character of our literature from the returns of bis ledger be collects with statistical accuracy the sort of book which is wanting  and lie dictates to the author both the direction he is to take and the level he is to maintain another consequence of the new market opened to literature is the increased rapidity of its movement av ith the reduction in the value of the article demanded there coexists an increase of effective demand the supply of this demand while on the one hand it tempts or rather forces the author into a diminution of labour on the other has begot in the purchaser a diseased passion for novelty the latter acquires a habit of reading with rapidity  of reading without judgment and whatever tempts him to pause for reflection will throw him behindhand willi the march of publication if it does not thwart him by offering an insuperable obstacle to bis progress in this state of tilings the prolits of a quick return of capital acquire importance in the publishers eye lt is not the extent of sale but its rapidity that is chieily regarded and an indifferent manuscript purchased at a low price and driven through the inarki t at a handgallop is more esteemed than a valuable work whose purchase money is to be spread over many editions this state of the market combining with the increased diffusion of mechanical education bas also opened literature to a less qualified class of writers writing is a trade that requires no capital and all the minor talents excluded by their poverty from entering on other professions crowd eagerly into the publishing market thus in spite ol the daily increasing demand the market is effectually overstocked prices fall and the author who writes for bread the great majority of those who succeed in literature i is compelled to work with greater rapidity and to substitute the number for the inherent excellence of bis works at the back of these extrinie influences there exists a difference arising from a change going forward in the national manners a sort of intellectual effeminacy ariing out of a long peace and steady public prosperity the sympathies of the masses have lost something ot their healthy activity a cold selfishness and indifference to others have stolen over them which lune tended powerfully to introduce two very opposite phenomena in the literature of the day in one class of temperaments it has engendered a dislike to strong sensations of any sort a craving for the lightest species of amusement and a disgust for all sorts of writing which makes any very powerful calls on attention by pathos humour or even by an ordinary earnestness of purpose persons thus circumstanced whether plunged in the merest intellectual idleness or prtoccupicd by commercial or by political interests look to fictitious literature as a source only of pastime and repose  and it may be laid down as a rule that the greater the interests xvliich rest on the shoulders of the reader the nion iliinsy and trilling are the works of his predilection of another class cf temperament the very reverse may be predicted in the lower classes of society there is to be found an equal selfishness perhaps to that which reigns in thc higher but it is engendered by other causes their selfishness and apathy are for the most part the results of the severity of the struggle for existence and ofthe constant recurrence of uneasy sensations which while they blunt the sympathetic susceptibilities brace rather than overpower the mind with the loxver classes the desire for strong sensations predominates but these are not to be obtained through the ordinary channels of legitimate literature and for such readers are produced the atrocities of the newgate school the adventures of buccaneers ihe sea novels and other tales of course and exciting adventure without proceeding further at the present moment in this analysis enough xve imagine has been said to account to a certain extent for the phenomena xvhich mark the present era of literature and distinguish it from that of tue last generation the change is not wholly indifferent to criticism itself the critic as belonging to the public must of necessity adopt sonic portion of its prejudices like other more dignified persons he must find his nature subdued to the atmosphere in xvliich he lives ihit were ibis otherwise if critics and authors were not in fact the same individual it would be unfair in the former to place themselves in the higher regions of their art or to measure the anthills ol one generation by the standards of another and it xvould be as usclesas it is cruel ihe shrewdest critics haxe generally lived in ages of declining literature  and they have done little towards arresting the decline by though severity oltin ir dicta because they

arranged round the dowager prototypes in the world of fashion  indeed it is scarcely possible to avoid them  but then it is only in so far as regards the particular trait not as respects the entire

the most agreeable portion of the book for the rest a mere portraiture of fashionable manners can lav but few claims to the higher excellencies ofthe hilier literature and the haste which mrs gores extraordinary fecundity operated upon as it is by the stimulation of a ceaseless demand for novelties induces a carelessness of execution and a rapidity of combination unfavourable to the full devclopement of her powers that she displays neither the depth of pathos nor the vigour and variety of combination formerly thought necessary to a first class novel is as we have endeavoured to show

and though though principal object of the book may be said to survive to the last if we assume it to bo represented by the character of ravensdale himself under the series of influences brought about by the revolving years the mode of arriving at it we must think clumsy and inartificial still there are noble things elicited in this character which is that a proud selfbrooding not naturally bad disposition but made evil by circumstances by want of proper restraints by those jealousies and exactions of a too susceptible temper which tum the host qualities to a bad account and by the cold

challenges more than the common attention though it may not obtain more than qualified praise from miss austen the writer seems to have drawn her chief inspiration and this is a model quite as dangerous ns it is admirable we know of nothing so difficult to copy instinctively to look out upon the little world within reach of us precisely as that good little lady of hampshire did we take to be the only way to turn aside from it to peep into her liooks and to form though resolution to write another book j that shall be liko thew is certainly not though way now i ivetween these two modes of going to work the author of the fair carew has stumbled somewhat she has really not aj little of the raiuuto fidelity of detail the easy manner and the nice perception of character which make miss austen s itooks so delightful but mero writing mere wordphrasing views drawn from books and though want of that compactness and singleness of purposo which the charm of reality gives to a 6tory however slight in texturo or apparently unconnected interfere to spoil those better qualifies still it is long since we read a book of this class with upon the whole greater promise in it the scenes are too many the connexion too slight and the canvas too much spread for the subject that fills it but it is impossible not to recognise and enjoy the shrewdness the familiarity with kioks as well as life and the social whim and satire displayed in the course of the tale the opening sketch of the luttrells is so good that we attribute something of the sense of failure in the later scenes to an expectation thus somewhat too highly raised but mr francis luttrell is good to the last so is the mother of the heroine and in the touches which mark poor mies esther s transition to old nwiidisra as well as in the jilting flirting match making and matchescaping which appear to be always going on there is enough of humorous observation and common life truth and sagacity to render the next

something more than this it is the production of a writer of genius you feel this when you have advanced a few pages and the feeling never leaves you even through the comparative failure of the last volume what his exact drift may have been in writing such a book wo do not quite see  for we more than doubt if its tendency can be held favourable to the jewish community though it conveys to thc christian some grave and important lessons but the people brought into a book by a man of genius are apt to do and say for themselves more than appears to bo formally set down for them  and this we may accept as in some degree explaining what many will think the unsatisfactory impression produced by jacob bendixen it is not simply the christians who are intolerant the narrative would seem to teach us  but the jews also  and from that clash of intolerance on both sides we must draw for ourselves what silent lessons of tolerance we may they will not be few or unimpressive when the book is rightly read it opens with a picture of the hems boyhood and of the influences stamped indelibly on those tender years when to the brand of caste is added that of persecution here there are several very touching passages made doubly effective by the contrast which immediately follows of the ame youth oast suddenly amid the livelier enjoyments and larger life of a family of christians the result is that his faith in all that may be called extrinsic to the jewish dogma is shaken  and we could have no better evidence of the writers ability than though effect which this produces on though jewish household wo so how injustice begets injustice and to what evil issues persecution tends in continuing though very bigotries from which it draws excuse and support observing this unfavourable side in though persecuted race we are next shown th less favourable side in the christian and a love engagement into which thc hero has entered closes in mortification and despair we do not think the subsequent scenes in france and algeria very successful in so far as the story is concerned but the writing continues to to admirable  and with the return of the jew to copenhagen his fall into the worldly habits of his tribe the blighted lifo and mean pursuit showing still the old liberal and noble nature and finally his funeral with the accompanying yells of the mob and though stones thing against his coffin wo close a book which is calculated to leave a strong and salutary impression j on all but the most superficial readers of the conrail and thc harem wo may simply say that though story hardly justifies the title it is a romantic tale of the civil wars of italy in though middle ages narrated originally in choice italian and to which madame pisani has given a graceful knglish dress neither convent nor harem figure in it however except that from the latter ono of its heroines emerges and in the former its other heroine earnestly longs for repose though scene is stormily

different is the scene and strangely contrasted the actors in the last story on our present listantony the deaf and dumb boy this is a strange poor inartificial not very interesting novel and yet it

declaration when what we may call the catastrophe of his present narrative arrives this is in the shape of young davison from india  the old pupil who revisits the school one morning suddenly pays ancient unsettled debts to the old tartwoman gets a holiday for the hoys stuffs them with bullseyes and polonies and carries off the governess such is the framework slight but sufficient in which mr titmarsh sets his juvenile portraits first comes the cock of the school champion major who is a large strong lazy goodhumoured blueeyed capable fellow as magnanimous as he is brave and the favourite of everybody then there is hulker who would be almost as great a favourite if he were not poor fellow so stupid  one of those honest generous active incorrigibly dull boys that fill one with love and pity and hatred of the latin grammar mr titmarsh shows his kindly wisdom in showing his sympathy with hulker then there are the briggss who are apt to sink low in the school and get bullied till a hamper from home mollifies persecution and a general feast in the bedroom sets all to rights next there is bullock a clever mean cowardly plodding carefol humbug who cheats the litue bovs prac tices

epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragic in their incidents it becomes very difficult to say what may not be called an idyll this is cowardly to put the mildest censure on it surely a man and a scholar after reading poems epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragio in their incidents should find it very easy to say  there are compositions whioh may not be called idylls of such are these poems of the king i will not believe that even the shade of tennyson could be set aquiver by a quiet polite comment to that effect meanwhile it is here not so important to decide what is not an idyll as it is to deoide what an idyll is the word  idyll looked into is seen to mean  a little picture   and all the best idyllmakers from theocritus to jane barlow have given us little pictures for a little pioture it might naturally be supposed that one would ohoose a little subject a cottage rather than a castle little claus rather than big claus this again is what the best idyllmakers have always done even when the doing of it must have gone somewhat against the grain the great pastoral poet of greece makes an infamous act the theme of his eulogy because the doer of it was ptolemy the great pastoral poet of greece was partial to royalty but he did not make royalty dominate in his idylls lycidas was a goatherd goatherds harvestmen fishermenthese we meet in the famed idylls of greece very different they are from their brother  craftsmen whom we have known in the flesh if theocritus has drawn them truthfully the explanation of this fact is to be found in the time and the clime in which they lived their world was younger than ours by two thousand years the sky above them was a sicilian one well might they in the worlds youth and worlds garden live a life so free from care that they had to  make up  their sorrows 1 it is profitless perhaps but it is rather tempting to conjecture what would have happened to them if they had been sent  jumping oer times  the bold phrase is shaksperes to our time and if they had been brought to a standstill at lisconnel among goatherds harvestmen and fishermen in a world older by two thousand years with an irish sky over this bit of it among folk whose life is so laden with care that they have to  make up  their joys my feeling is that even lycidas who goatherd as he was could recite poems of his own composition upon occasion would have succumbed to what to any but a grey eye or soan irish eye would seem lamentably lacking in matter for poetry it is impossible to praise in excess the consummate skill with which miss barlow has made anew little pictures of the loveliest with this drear lisconnel for background and in the foreground nothing brighter than the blue of mrs kilfoyles cloak for what painters call a point of colour they who echo the famous german who said ich hasse ail zweitenmale may put down strangers at lisconnel at once  for it is nothing but what it calls itself  a second series of

quare one i do not give it for two reasons i want the reader to go to the book and i want to give another passage you are to know that a theft has been perpetrated in lisconnel a thief has appeared there his appearance is followed by that of policemen it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of two active and stalwart civil servants would have been welcomed as happening just in the nick of time yet it argues an alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means possible the men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to the category of pitatyblights rintwarnins fevers and the like devastators of life that dog a man more or less all through it but close in on him a pitiful quarry when the bad seasons come and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin wid the hunger and his own heart is broke therefore to accept assistance from them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most reprehensibly unnatural to put a private quarrel or injury into the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the public foe a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a trivial temporary convenience lisconnel has never been skilled in the profitable and useful art of utilising its enemies not that anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments much less attempted to express them in set terms when a policeman appeared there was an inquiring mood what people said among themselves was  musha cock bim up i hope hell get his health till i would be tellin him or words to that effect while in reply to his questions they made statements superficially so clear and simple and essentially so bewilderingly involved that the longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle them there is a very general idea in england that irelands history has been written by moore lecky froude keating and some others and there has grown up a practice of late years of rather industriously studying these writers who are some of them interesting but are none of them quite reliable it is a curious fact that the writer who is the best historian that ireland has yet bad miss jane barlow is not only more reliable than any of the historians named above but is also immeasurably more interesting than any of them froude is

disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it

witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with

lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed

lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the exercise of just that lyric power which is his special contribution to the art of the modern short story,unmarked

reserve because a book of purpose so noble and elevated bearing a name so known and honoured rather commands our welcome than demands our sentence for her who wrote the  romaunt of margaret and  lady geraldine the laurel crown baa long ago been woven what then can the charons of literature do when such come to his river but set them forthwith on their way to the elysian fields not that he who takes our poetess for guide will wander in elysian meadows or tread upon the asphodel her footsteps are on earth often in earths darkest and commonest ways her way lies through sorrows and battled efforts and useless hopes and yet perhaps he who reads  aurora leigh  as earnestly as  aurora leigh  was written may in some degree pass as did the florentine and his leader from the gloom of the inferno to the pleasant daylight of upper air the story of aurora leigh is not original in so far as love is not original nor heroic struggle nor disappointment nor death but it claims such merit in that the writer seems to draw her materials from a source open for such a purpose only to herthe records of her proper life if this be so much in the narrative which seems improbable may be simply true it is told like the tale of an jeschylean drama through the lips of some three or four speakers but its pauses are filled with a fullertoned chorus than the atheniansan underwail of human music with its strophe and antistrophe of suffering and hope the incidents of the book would have thrilled in a novelthe loftiness of the philosophy would have allured in a treatisetogether they compose a poem whose action criticism must allow to be as sustained as its scope is large and noble  aurora leigh the heroine inherits with the learning of her english father the warm blood of an italian mother and with such natal antecedents and some repression becomes naturally a poetess her neighbour and cousin romney leigh is a poet also but too practical for print by no means one who stands high upon the bank of theories observes the swimmers and criesvery fine but keeps dry linen equally rather a very earnest plunger into them and one bent upon setting a wrong world right by means of them  aurora counts up somewhat sarcastically his ends  to reform make trade a christian possibility and individual right no general wrong wipe out earths furrows of the  mine and  thine and leave our green for men to pluy at bowls with innings for them all at which  game it is needless to say that he must fail and does accordingly fail but  auroras  enthusiasm for art is at least as great as romneys for actionand between their keen intellects a fire is struck which lights up many a dark dialectic corner let those who care to follow such a light no ignis fatuus be it said turn to the volume they will find what  aurora has to say for the followers of her art thc only truthtellers now left to god thc only speakers of essential truth opposed to relative comparative and temporal truthsthe only holders by his sunskirts through constitutional grey glooms and how frequently she can praise her art itself o lifeo poetry which means life in lifecognizant of life beyond this bloodheat passionate for truth beyond these sensespoetry my life my eagle with both grappling feet still hot from zeus thunder who has ravished me away from all the shepherds sheep and dogs and set me in th olympian roar and round but om readers must believe that what we quote only excludes something worthier quotation the nine books are full of brilliant passages and they must wonder for themselves at the writers tide of thought running without an ebbat her affluence of ideas and opulence of illustrationgolden treasures these which never tempt her like atalantas apples to swerve from the straight course to the goal of her meaning yet sometimes it must be confessed this eagle of thoughtthough it be joves own bird sinks under ganymede hts flight is high still absolute truth sits higher but no tenderness can be more womanly and deep then aurora leighsif her philosophy reaches now and then short it cant be denied that she is a  bluebut then she wears her blue so chiefly in her eyes it comforts you cutirely for her fame and the reader will say as much with lady waldemar when the third book brings him to marian erle and her piteous history there the authoress with a womans right pleads against a womans wrong and we acknowledge many will with tealsthe righteousness of though indignation and the fitness of the compassion which storms or sighs through her passionate language our limit will not permit us to dwell upon this episodebut we make room for a remark upon a subject that will doubtless call forth many a one it is customary that virtuous women should preserve silence nay rather profess ignorance of that great sin whose innocent victim was the gentle marian erle through this coan veil of conclusion our authoress sternly strikes her hand she declares the protest of silence not loud enough to daunt the hand before the eyes not large enough to hide and she bids them flash forth with a light too intense for those sons of darkness to endure the subject is profoundly difficult and painful but it must be a timid and selfish prudery that could condemn the example of fearless ay and feminine boldness which the writer has in this respect not shrunk from setting we have touched but lightly on the plot and we cannot much dilate upon the purpose of the volume both deserve a separate and careful notice the conclusion that where we disavow being keeper to our brotherwere his cain is illogical but romneys efforts are generous if extravagant well intended if futile the keynote of the book is struck in the constant protest against his modern fashion by which we talk by aggregates and think by systemsand being used to face our evils in statistics are inclined to cap them with unreal remedies drawn out in haste on th other side o the itate these reformers say 1 have a pattern on my nail and i will carve the world new after it and  aurora is mainly right in reiterating that tis impossible to get at men excepting through their souls she exalts with great force the efficacy of art in such work in many a passage which presses for our mention we must leave the reader to learn how romneys failure marians fate and her lovers suffering teach aurora that art is much but love is more and the reader must for himself appreciate how splendidly and with what pathos the ninth book brings the volume to a close in a flow of unbroken beauty thus far we have not stinted our praise of this remarkable production justice and the dignity of our craft demand that we should find fault with the occasional extravagance of epithet and simile in which our authoress indulges it is harshespecially at this chilly seasonto blaine the general world for being a fullveined heaving doublebreasted age and she must forgive our wandering fancy for connecting with such a passage as the following the cruel yelhw morning pecked at her upou thc straw inside  the unavoidable idea of a hugeous  buff cochin china breakfasting voraciously we have baid that  aurora  is now and then indistinct and seems not only to  fly too high but to fly on sometimes with a tired wing in the story too there is an omission which seems unintentional and which the interest excited makes unpardonablean omission of any mention of marian eries subsequent fortunes we cannot help also saying that romney leigh acts throughout in very decided defiance to the adage which tells us its best to bc off with the old love before you get on with the new we present our readers with one or two final brilliancies taken with a hasty hand and of which the setting is frequently costlier than the gem the elegance of mrs brownings scholarship

carelessness in the construction of her sentences and we are not disposed to defend her against the charge of mannerism but thete drawbacks are only occasional in her grand flights we can overlook incidental failings knowing as we do that the eagle which soars nearest to the sun is no less a royal bird because the tip of his pinion has been soiled in its contact with the earth that the highest convictions of life and art have entered into the composition of this new poem aurora leaqh there can be no doubt since every page shows the result rather than the process of thought the whole poem is wonderfully suggestive it takes up an ordinary subject of the day and in a poetical sensewe are not so sure about the philosophical sensemakes it extraordinary this is clearly not a poem for flippant readersnot a poem that any one for fashions sake may canter through it is not a fashionable rotten row of rhythm but the bold broad path leading tosome magnifieent cathedral in its every pagethereisalivingthought throbbinglikeapnl e life is always more serious thanthefool in hisfollv believes and this poem is life intensified its obvious pleasure and that which will make itself first of all felt is the story for this is charmin2ly varied and although it bristles with conceits and ethical crotchets yet it speaks a language which is absolutely universal the love which is purified by wanderings and sufferings comes honue at last like a wounded bird to its nest as did aurora and romney leighs every man and woman can understand that though not every reader will be able to divide the natural fronm the philosophic love so as to see that beneath the hard crust of the latter mrs browning is developing an important social truth scores of individuals who have no taste for statistics or unadorned facts will read this remarkable poem and thereby better understand the surgings of society the social volcanoes which strnigle in the very centre of english life first the enjoyment of the story will break upon them with a new rapture like morning then as they read more intensely for the storys sake they will perceive that romney and aurora leigh are types of distinctive endeavours to elevate the condition of humanityromney dealing with statistically packed disorders  in the body and aurora contending with the diseases of tie soul rhese converging actionsthe two cousins like their ideas have been moving in distant orbitscome home at last to reap the knowledge that it is idle if not wicked to expect too much from individual effort to give up much on each side then tawe all but the triumph of the poet of aurora is complete when at length romney in the luxury of requited love exclaims fewer systems we who are held and do not hold les mapning out of massea to be saved lisv nations or by sexes fouriers void and comte is dwarfedand cabet puerile subsists no law of life outside of life no p feet manners without chi intian seals the christ himself had been no lawgiver unless le had given the lifo too with the law late in the season of life but not too late these toilers in a noble causea cause made only slightly less noble by the impatience and fretfulnest of the poet and philanthropistare brought to see that all work for the regeneration of men is circumcribed by two circles the first circle is that which isgrandest broadest ftrd mostluminous and designated  gods love  the next is termed the love of wedded souls there certainly is poetic force if not human justice in afflicting lromney with blindneess in the sequelmade blind by the vulgar wretches whose condition he had eniployed his generous youth to ameliorate the situation is pathetic but it shows clearly the domination of that ideaauroras ideawhich sought to elevate the flesh by the elevation of soul aurora must gaze for romney now she must shine out for two and no less work for both it will be seen therefore that this poem has a design hut whether this design has been developed with philosophic regularity as it certainiv has been unfolded with poetic beauty is a question that every reader will answer for himself we have no hesitation in saying that no modern poem has so many passages of brilliant description if it were worth while to cite any passages unworthy the poem we should instance the feeble gossip in the church when romney is about as some respectable persons would say to make a fool of himself by marrying a seamstress but then romney is true to his principle of ihumnan equality our objection to this gossip is not that it is a fabrication and wholly untrue to life but that it is ill suited to the character and manner of the poem it cannot be looked upon as that true repose or artistic declension so often successfully applied by great poets just before the situation is strained towards its highest pitch it is rather like an indignity to the muse just as if an arabian steed of high mettle and proud action were compelled to bear the dishonour of panniers mrs brownings views on art are so elaborated form in fact so large a feature in this poem that they would require a long article either to support or refute them we therefore leave them to the quarterlies at the same time suggesting that they afford material for a very interesting paper our object is rather to give our readers some choice poetic portions of the poem if we retrace the story it will be in so brief a manner as to do no injustice to mrs browning by cheating her readers of an anticipated pleasure our object is to render the extracts still more interesting by showing them in their natural conjunctions first then this book is an autobigraphy written when aurora leigh was still  what men call young when she had not so far left the shores of life as not to hear  the intirmur of the outer infinite our first extract will lodge us on the threshold of auroras career it is full of wisdom anti truth too and for these so truthful words grim men should be tolerant of nursery  trifles if any man has the dombey vein let him read this extract a dozen times and if he io not then become wiser there is no hope of his redemption i write my mnother was a florentine whom

of ours so that he pays his just share of the incometax and does not owe for his newspaper while romney is out endeavournng to rub the rust off the ample shield of society a certain lady waldemar pays aurora a vi it with the apparent design of patronising the muse very considerate of lady waldemar and the example might have gone far to draw down aristocratic smiles on the labours of poor bards were it not for the disagreeable fact that lady waldemar is in love with romney but romney true to his philanthropic resolve scorns the highborn lady and determines to wed marian erlea sweet crea ture but the daughter of brutalised and brutalising parents he would conciliate the poor by marrying into their ranks and shame the rich by giving a personal proof of human equality half the interest of the poem hangs on the eventful life of marian erle we watch the fate of this blossom with intense apprehension every wind that sends it eddying through the dusty hlghroads of life has its especial interest when it is at length strippedfor no fault of its ownof a portion of its beauty when itthat is marian erlequivers with the first sharp knowledge that mans violence not his seduction has blighted her then the poet is developing in that poor forlorn girl those holy feelings which place a mother only a little lower than the angels but not to anticipate the course of events we must show how marian escaped from her vile parents this passage for fervent forceful description has scarcely a parallel in the english language one day said martanthe sun shone that dayher mother had been

is waiting in a church with his fashionable friends in order to wed marian half st giles in frieze was bidden to meet st james hn cloth of gold there is first among the highborn visitors the particularly small gossip to which we have alluded then impatience then surprise and lastly it may be the proud gratification that marian does not come she poor girl has been what is vulgarly termed trapped by lady waldemar she writes a letter to romney which delivers him up  to his own prosperities and in a brief space is on her way to paris under the guidance of a 1 devils daughter being no other than one of lady waldemars women what followed we have already hinted at subsequently aurora leigh wandering about paris in pursuit of her divine art accidentally discovers the wanderer but first we must give auroras description of paris because it is pictorial and also because it contains some of those peculiar views of art which interlace almost every page of the volume the city swims in verdure beautiful am venice on the waters the seaswan what bosk gardens dropped in closewalled courts as plums in ladles laps who start and laugh what miles of streets that run on after trees still carrying the necesary shops those open caskets with the jewels seen i and trade is art and arts philosophy in paris theres a silk for instance there as worth an artists study for the folds as that bronze opposite nay the bronze ha faults arts here too artfulconscioua as a maid who leans to mark her shadow on the wall until she lose a vantage in her step yet art walks forward and knows where to walk the artsts also are idealists too ab olute for nature logical to austerity in the application of the special theory not a soul content to paint a crooked pollard and an ass as the english will because they find it so and like it somehowah the old tuileries is pnillng its high cap down on its eyes confounded eonsciencestricken and amazed by the apparition of a new fair face in those devouring mirrors through the grate within the gardens what a heap of babes swept up like leaves beneath the ehesnuttroes from every street and alley of the town bv the ghosts perhaps that blow too bleak this way alooking for their heads dear pretty babes ill wish them luck to hare their ballplay out before the next change comerand farther on what statues poised upon their columns fine as if to stand a moment were a feat against that blue what squares what breathingroom for a nation that runs fastay runs against the dentists teeth at the corner in pale rows which grin at progress in an epigram while aurora is musing on life and art a face flashes by god whose face is that that face persists it floats up it turns over in my mind as like to marian as one dead is like the same alire in very deed a face and not a fancy though it vanished so the small fair fice between the darks of hair i used to liken when i saw her first to a point of moonlit water down a well the low brow the frank space between the eves which always had the brown pathetic look if a dumb creature who had been beaten orce and never since was easy with the world ali ahnow i remember perfectly those eyes todavyhow overlarge they seemed a if some patient passinnate despair like a coal dropped and forgot en tapestry which slowly burns a widening circle ont had burnt them larger larger and those eyes todav i do

artists eye that keeps the shadeside of the thing it loves halfabsent wholeobeerving while the crowd of young vivacious and blackbraided heads dipped quick as finches in a blossomed tree among the nosegays cheapening this and that in such a cheerful twitter of rapid speechmy heart leapt in me startled by a voice that slowly faintly with long breaths that marked the interval between the wilh and word inquired in strangers french w would that be mnch that branch of flowering mountaingorse so much too much for me then turning the face round so close upon me that i felt the sigh it turned with they go off together marian leading the way to the miserable room in which she lodged we have heard it stated that mirs browning is not intelligible that she is never certain of her meaning the assertion is a stupid libel on her genius for if she does not always she certainly does frequently speak with a natural and fervid utterance the woman and the artist are often so exquisitely mingled as ill the passage we are about to quote that we cannot tell which is dominant while both are working at the creation of a picture which we do not so much see as feel no one surely can miss the simplicity of the following and we pity the man who cannot perceive its beauty alone she threw her bonnet off then sighing as twere sighing the last time approached the bed and drew a shawl away yon

should take such innocence to prove just guilt i thought and stood there dumb the light upon his eyelids pricked them wide and staring out at us with all their blue as half perplexed between the angelhood lie had been away to visit in his sleep and our most mortal presencegradually he saw his mothers face accepting it in change for heaven itselz with such a smile as might have well been

whole pale passionate face mouth forehead eyes one gaze she stood then slowly as he smiled she smiled too slowly smillng unaware and drawing from his countenance to hers a fainter red as if she watched a flame and stood in it aglow how beautiful said she mlarian relates to aurora the fearful story of the drugged cup the after madness and misery the shameful but not so far as she is concerned history which made her a mother but this we must for want of space pass overpas it with regret and regretting still more that the world had so few aurora leighs to soothe the anguish of the unfortunate and to say as aurora didi am lonely in the world and thou art lonely and the child is half an orphan comeand henceforth theu and i being still together will not miss a friend nor he a father since two mothers shall make that up to him i am journeying south and in my tuscan home ill end a niche and set thee there my saint the child and thee and burn the lights of love befor thy face

i not follow them into their tuscan home we will even be more provokingmore torturing if you like the term betterand say that the two last chapters of the poem the eighth and ninth where the glorious scenery of their tuscan home is celebrated is the finest and grandest in the book we will merely state that romney comes there that he has not married lady waldemar i that lie weds aurora that maian is happy with her child and so alls well that ends well  aurora leigh by elizabeth barrett browninl new edition with prefatory note by algernon charles swinburne 35 6d smith elder aurora leigh  is good to read over again and there should be many ot the new generation introduced to it through this charming edition mr swinburne says of it  it is one of the longest poems in the world and there is not a dead line in it and in saying so he is not overenthusiastic for while you mray coldly criticise some of its characters and incidents the feeling beneath them is still alive and glowing and how high is the general level of the workmanship i but while mr swinburne is so warmly appreciative of the poetic value of the book lie carps needlessly at the story  a young lady of family be says  who lodges by herself in grub street preserves her reputation lives on her pen and dines out in mayfair is hardly a figure for serious fiction oh but the young lady of family or otherwise does all that

B6413,['8774297'],  the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature

B5662,"['6868800', '9375082', '2438171', '2436080']",  fiction sinister street by compton mackenzie martin i secker 6s t here are five hundred closely printed pages in t this book yet we are informed that it is but the half of the novel and that the other half will follow early next year there is nothing here that is not as it should be but we do feel inclined to take mr mackenzie aside and complain to him when we find that in spite of those five hundred closely printed pages the novel has not even begun it has not even begun in the most elementary sense of giving us someone to be interested in the present book purports to recount for us the life of one charles michael saxby fane until the time when he orders his thoughts towards oxford and the most exacting lover of detail will not deny that facts and details enough are given of the life supposed to have been led by that same charles michael saxby fane but the unfortunate fact is that he has not yet begun to exist he is but a name that serves as an excuse for an elaborate description of childhood and school affairs it is not until page 350 that some of the names begin to distinguish themselves into personalities and even after then the i distinction is not developed that is to say the characterisation is not worked out whether in terms of action or psychology and when the book concludes the potentialities of conduct and therefore of interest still do not exist when such a state of affairs occurs with a novelist of the promise of mr mackenzie it is interesting to see how it has been caused to be compelled to deny at the end of a considerable book that there is no such person as its ostensible hero is not sufficient that is only a method of evasion and if nothing else prevailed mr mackenzies standing as a novelist protects him from that easy device and when we come to examine the book closely an interesting artistic problem reveals itself that happens incidentally to concern in its implication a good deal of modern work in the novel for the novel is not a hotchpot into which anything and everything may be emptied the position of each detail is exactingly circumscribed by its significance any portion of any description that is not there for the better understanding of the central concern is just so much waste tissue and the natural result of the inclusion of such indeterminate matter must be that the central concern will be hindered in its proper development that sounds academic enough to be sure and though every defiance of academic statements is all to the good yet mr mackenzie does not justify himself there is for instance a chapter entitled characteristically enough unending childhood and in it is little that could not with advantage have been eliminated fane might have had to repeat mensa mensa mensam and so forth in a meaningless ceremonial we ourselves had to do so but we suggest that it is nothing to the purpose that we should be told of it fully we donot presume to say that to mr mackenzie that ceremonial had not some significance but he has not conveyed it to us and that is the test of the book in fact it seems to us that mr mackenzie himself has felt this for he bends his mind to making these endless details interesting for themselves by his witty telling of them and that is excellently legitimate though it does not alter the fact what is it to us that we should be told of the paper flowers that michael made at the kindergarten or of his difficulties with et and iny in the special  had these things with many other such details fully told been cut out would the book have suffered  we are compelled to answer our own question by saying frankly that the book in its present form would have suffered such details have come to occupy so large a part that the chief interest is derived from them and not from charles michael saxby fane on whose account they were ordered we are quite sure that this was not at all what a novelist like mr mackenzie meant he quotes at the outset the passage from one of keats letters to the effect that the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in a ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thicksighted that is as it were his text every external incident therefore only has significance in the degree in which it refers to this factor otherwiseof psychology but he has turned aside from artistic restraintor let us say more precisely his restraint in artand let himself loose in details that have not that significance with the result that they have crowded out the exposition of adolescence he intended have banished michael fane and reign in his stead yet even here a curious thing transpires for the events of the latter half of the book are in themselves a great deal more interesting than the events of the first half while being at the same time a great deal more in exposition of the personality that fane in consequence begins now slowly to acquire it is with the later introduction of michaels friend alan and the contrast that mr mackenzie now sets himself to display between the two that the wheels of the story begin to grip the metals but the whole fault of the book at least thus far is that it is not depicted from within outwards but from without inwards often not reaching the inner complication of nerves and desires blood and emotions and resolutions at all that is even the case in the episodes of adolescence though these are described as vivaciously as we should expect from mr mackenzies pert the lack of condensation has indeed taken off the vivid glow from his style but its general witful attitude remains though it shines no more and this is especially so with regard to the latter half it is not altogether easy to arrive at conclusions since the book itself does not our judgement is left like our interest in midair it would seem that mr mackenzie never intended originally to publish the book in two halves if he had he would probably have made each half selfcontained and selfconsistent and this particular half is neither one nor the other going lamely and uncertainly as a consequence the other half is to be expected next year perhaps the two halves will fit perfectly together and give each life if they do we shall rejoice yet at the moment our interest remains in suspended animation  fiction social studies sinister street by compton mackenzie vol ii martin seeker 65 another six hundred pages concerning michael fane  we will

affirm that there are few pages which do not carry the reader on with fresh zest book iii is a vivid presentment of oxford life though we are glad to know that detailed as it is it is not a complete picture the hero is now more than ever the young man cursed with the knowledge that all possible precautions have been made against its ever becoming necessary for him to earn his own living occasionally he is vaguely conscious of a desire to be something more than a consumer all his life  more often he is merely depressed by the futility of things as he sees them he takes part with relish in drunken orgies accompanied by a burst of destructiveness which would have been an outrage if carried out by a suffragette or a german but which many may consider creditable in his case for at the bidding of his proctor he cheerfully provides the money for the wages of those who have to repair the damage never does he reflect that his recurring satiety is obtained at the cost of many others who have no such chances his habit of oxford attitudinizing is cleverly conveyed in one of the authors comments he  consoled himself for the absence of subtlety or cleverness hi such an answer by the fact that at least it was a direct statement of what he thought once during his varsity career he is shocked by the thought that he may have some direct responsibility for the death of his mothers friend who had looked to him for sympathy in his failure to woo his sister in book iv entitled  romantic education mr mackenzie secures a striking contrast by plunging his hero into the nether world of london  down  from oxford and finding himself at a loose end  common to this type of man he turns into a musichall and thore learns that the girl he had made love to six years before has become a prostitute infatuated with the power of his personality he conceives the idea that he can save her by marrying her thus securing the opportunity to make a bigger fool of himself than ever throughout the two books which comsose this volume there are many ashes of intuition as to the contemporary leniency towards hypocrisy but we doubt whether the author meant to make his hero quite so criminal a fool in his efforts to help his fellows as he will appear to those who have to combat the misspent efforts of such people the heros friend is on occasion too obviously used as a stalkinghorse to draw forth clever disquisition and so has to appear more foolish than he really is our grasp of one character at least the heros mother is strengthened in this second volume    dearest boy i ia on though committee of a society for the abatement of london street noises   so deeply occupied with reform he said patting her hand   one must do something she smiled we thank mr mackenzio for that so far as his hero is concerned we cannot sum him up any better than we did in reviewing the first volume   his failing is the lack of a guiding principle sufficiently strong to counteract the relatively cheap allurements of life if he was as is suggested received into the roman catholic priesthood that mighty organisation may have converted a waster into a useful citizen if so it was an achievement more notable than any set down yet by mr mackenzie if this delineation brings home to any their responsibility for imbuing our enemies with the idea that we are a decadent race unworthy of our christian ideals then mr mackenzie will serve a moral as well as an artistic purpose we do not however expect so much from it the author with scathing irony depicts his hero as himself resenting  life given for the sake of thousands more unworthy living comfortably at home in the writing we admire most the authors wealth and appositeness in though choice of words on the other hand some sentences are in need of revision  sinister street volume ii by compton mackenzie martin secker 6s the temptation to write a long disquisition about this book is strong yet must be resisted space not permitting it and it is a pity for sinister street provides rich material for controversy itself touching upon so many profundities phases and ideas it provokes criticism to an unusual extent moreover it culminates in a conversion to rome this part is the weakest in the book for its reason is not obvious nor has the author taken pains to explain it one has to take it as it were cum grano for the rest the novel is genuinely interesting the picture of oxford of the good young man an english type passing through that delicious phase of youth is quite admirable then there is londonbohemian london the  gay life mr mackenzie is plainly half philosopher half esthete he can speak from the inside of women he is fearless sincere an artist if the conversion is rather temperamental than convincing it is suggestive as all the work of this author is he understands the lilys of this world altogether this is an arresting production a performance of literary merit  sinister street by compton mackenzie vol i martin secker 6s it may be that the dread prospect of the return of the three four or fivevolume novel determined the library censors to put their ban on this book when novels so popular as mr bennetts run into trilogies when even translations from french books such as jean christophe are published in england tetralogically messrs smith mudie and co may well have paused before committing themselves to the twovolume immensity of mr mackenzies new enterprise but these censors whose selfordained function it is to preserve the ignorance of youth have sufficient reason for banning this book if discussion of sex and sexuality is a crime any openminded reader of his novel will be convinced that mr mackenzie is attempting in a sincere and philosophic spirit to consider the supremely important effects upon character of the awakening of the sex impulse in youth this is very far from being the whole of his theme this influence is one among several supreme influences which he notes and analyses but it is a fact that he does give it a preponderance such as has probably never been assigned to it before in an english novel we welcome it as a sincere attempt to grapple with an important problem which not only every schoolmaster constantly discusses but which every headmaster in orders constantly preaches about in chapel before the whole of his school mr mackenzie happily does not preach for it is the business of a novelist not to preach but to present and to allow readers to come to any conclusion didactic or otherwise according to their fancy what we are concerned withbeing convinced that mr mackenzie has no arriere pensieis his truth to life and character he is addressing himself to a task similar to that of rolland in jean christophe and showing us the evolution of a boy who in the next volume is to become a mana boy sensitive yet masculine impressionable yet active ardent yet philosophic and brilliantin a certain sense a type and in another sense a superman or rather superboy michael hishers is the son of a mrs fane not married to that dimly shadowed father the earl of saxby michael and his sister stella are the loveproducts of this unrecognised union and both of them set out upon their exceptional yet representative careers we find it hard to be convinced by the psychology of michael the baby and small boy mr mackenzie probably resembles the rest of us in forgetting his own impressions at the age of two and in attempting to reconstruct the infantile phantasms of reality he is no more successful than he was in carnival or than m rolland was in jean christophe but no sooner has his hero gone to school than he begins to live for us as well as for himself this sinister picture of the foolish satire of masters the fashions and aspirations of small boys the keen zest for work and games and weariness of them the vast absorbing and sometimes hated institutional atmosphere of the school is a more faithful picture of publicschool life than anything we know in english fiction where mr mackenzie perhaps errs is in the emphasis he gives to certain exceptional influences in the life of his hero nearly all schoolboys are extraordinarily sentimental and extraordinarily religious but michael is a theologian many clever schoolboys are in danger of becoming aesthetes whether it be of the george moore or the oscar wilde type but michael outdoes them all nearly all of them are addicted to love affairs and take an interest in questions of sex but michael is more than most boys exposed to the violent surprises of knowledge but if mr mackenzie attends to this question very closely and actually gives it a greater importance than it seems to merit that is because he is attending very closely to all the remarkable influences which may be exerted upon an impressionable and exceptional boy we think that he has considering his whole scheme attempted a task which is rather too large for his philosophy but his characters are alive the school is a veritable hive of bees and drones we recognise it as a characteristic forcing ground of youth undoubtedly mr mackenzie has written a powerful and zestful book which the censor has advertised to the advantage of those whom he has introduced to it,unmarked

B1046,['8592004'],  the lovels of arden the locels of arden by the author of  lady audleys secret c c c in three volumes john maxwell aud co if there were anything more than the stringing together of unnatural and inartistic plots and the heaping of coarse drapery upon a number of stagepuppets in miss braddons novels it might be expected that in the twenty or more that she has written her literary resources would be somewhat exhausted as it is she is as fresh as ever the same puppets can be used over and over again with quite as much reason as on the first occasion and with their frequent use and constant exercise in their rearrangement comes a certain skill that makes the novels run more easily to the sort of readers who alone can take pleasure in such works as hers in many ways indeed she improves as she goes on in this latest of her productions the difficulties of english grammar are mastered the spelling of the trite french extracts is correct and the vulgarities of thought are somewhat smoothed over the ordinary materials of the sensational school too are here used very sparingly there is not so much as the mention of poisoning in the book there is not even any actual adultery in the first volume it is true miss braddons admirers will be cheered by the hope that not only will the seventh commandment be broken but that there will be incest as well but they will be disappointed at last if there is any disappointment after enjoying long chapters full of the outpourings of a mans lawless passion and the excitement of a married womans dalliance with him as far as eye and ear and mouth are concerned in finding that no actual sin has been committed and that virtue triumphs in the end miss braddons chief skill has always been shown in her mode of tickling without surfeiting the appetites of her readers and she excels in  the lovels of arden clarissa lovel the heroine is first introduced to us as a young lady of exquisite refinement and beauty just come from school who flirts with george fairfax a gentleman equally refined and beautiful during a night journey from london to yorkshire which they make in a firstclass railway carriage that has no other occupants miss lovels father of course descended from one of the oldest families in england has been brought down in the world by the extravagances of his wife who had spent his money in fascinating mr fairfaxs father and for some time we are allowed to suppose that the lovers of the second generation may be brother and sister but the errant mother and father have sinned only in thought and the errant daughter and son are to do no more their first meeting is soon followed by a long intimacy consequent on their being visitors at the same country house where also is staying lady geraldine challener to whom mr fairfax is to be married miss lovel being chosen as one of the bridesmaids after a ball preliminary to the wedding however mr fairfax takes miss lovels hand in  hi3 firm grasp and tells her that he likes her better than his betrothed and means to marry her lam not one of those saints he says in the hoarse hard voice  that is essential to such a declaration  who think of everybodys happiness before their own clarissa i am very human with all humanitys selfishness i want to be happy i want a wife for whom i can feel something more than a cold wellbred liking i did not think that it wa3 in me to feel more than that i thought i had outlived my capacity for loving wasted the strength of my hearts youth on worthless fancies spent all my patrimony of affection  but the light shines on me again and i thank my god that it is so yes clarissa come what may i thank my god that i am not so old a man in heart and feeling as i thought myself of course clarissa tries  to stem the current of his talk with her heart beating stormily but with semblance of exceeding calmness  but of course she reciprocates his passion though she seems to be in a vague way conscious that it would have been more decent for him to be formally off with the old love before he is on with the new she behaves as well as could be expected of her she refuses him  and refuses him again when the intended wedding is put off in consequence of the providential death of lady geraldines father he is mightily insulted and goes away in high dudgeon first unfolding to her his plans with an honesty that is astounding  i will stand aside and make way for a wealthier suitor says this highbred gentleman to this modest maiden  perhaps we may meet again some day and i may not be so unfortunate as my father after that the young lady is  going back to the house slowly tearless but with something like despair in her heart when she hears the orchardgate open again  he has come back perhapsreturned to forgive and pity her noit is the  wealthier suitor  who was to be made way for this person mr granger is as respectable a man as miss braddon can paint with the colours at her command it is needless to say that he is a millionaire he is also a widower with a daughter older than miss lovel miss lovel loathes him but she marries him because he and her father wish it in due time  god gives her a son she tries to be a good wife and after a little mild flirtation with mr fairfax she prays that she may not meet him again  her prayers were not grantedperhaps they did not come so entirely from the heart as prayers should that would fain bring a blessing she meets him often and he is most seductive when he appears before her in evening dress which has a sensuous meaning to miss braddon which we believe no other novelist has detected  the broad expanse of shirt front she exclaims in a sentence sufficiently eloquent though a verb is missing  with its delicate embroidery not obtrusively splendid but minutely elaborate rather involving the largest expenditure of needlework to produce the smallest and vaguest effect a suspicion of richness as it were nothing more the expanse of linen proclaims the breadth of chest and gives a factitious slimness to the waist mr fairfaxs factitious slimness overcomes mrs granger 8he confesses her love for him but refuses to run away ith him lest her son should  blush for his mother byandby  i have never found that sons have a faculty of blushing on account of that kind of thing mr fairfax answers and adds in a stage whisper  egad thered be a great deal of blushing going on at the crack clubs if they had   though mrs granger refuses to run away she does not mind talking and thinking adultery during a volumefull of clandestine interviews at last her lover by a very mean trick puts her in such a suspicious situation that her husband finding her in it insists on a separation she runs away with her baby but not with mr fairfax her baby nearly dies and her husband telegraphed for comes to help her to nurse him then she falls ill and her husband nurses her too the end of it is that mr granger says  my darling we will begin the world againwe will begin life over again clarissa   so all ends happily and mr fairfax after taking up with a spanish dancer marries a rich widow  he and clarissa meet sometimes in society meet touch hands even and know that every link between them is broken it has not been our misfortune to read all miss braddons novels but of all that we have read c the lovels of arden is the nastiest,unmarked

review a new work by miss bremer and yet the labour light and agreeable as it seems is not unattended with difficulty the charming dialogues and picturesque scenes which our authoress touches off so happily are too apt to cause him to forget the sterner portion of his duty and to overlook the great defect of these popular fictionsthe lax tone of morality pervading the majority of the series we may probably be deemed fastidious but it appears to us that too low a standard is allowed to feminine purity and thus a dark shade is cast over that otherwise beautiful story home and we fear that life in dalecarlia cannot be exempted from a similar reproach in the former novel a lady represented as moving in the higher circles of swedish life an excellent and exemplary woman but just escapes an entanglement with the tutor of her children a young man of 20 in the present tale a lady of equally admirable character loved and respected by an attached md worthy husband lives with him for years without ac luainting him with her former marriagea marriage unhap pily contracted against the advice of friends with a clever but unprincipled man whose contempt for human ordinances separates him from his wife and subjects him to the ignominy of a shameful death this man is believed dead so far the wife is justified in marrying again yet how she can live on year after year with an openhearted confiding husband keeping her own secret and yet happy seems such an anomaly that really we can neither reconcile ourselves to the fact nor the lady perhaps we might not have made this protest but for the purpose of noticing the difference existing betweenb english and swedish manners and of observing that although our own domestic life may be less romantic than that of our northern friends it is in appearance at least infinitely more moral yet how ungrateful it seems to make these remarks when we consider how much we are indebted to the howtrrs for the introduction of their booksbooks that have pictured in such bright colours the delights of homethat holy word so dear to every englishmanand that have thrown a halo around the most trivial and commonplace offices of life investing them with a charm which many must have felt but more forgotten ever existed or if remembered remembered but to ridicule and now having finished our homily let us at once start for dalecarlia where a mrs

a capital name for a ladys courserher affectionate though energetic disposition render her most engaging and centre in her the whole and undivided interest of the reader blow to introduce this fairylike being mind a german fairy not the pretty delicate elf of merrie england or the waggish imp of old ireland whether sailing on the silja  the eye of dalarna galloping wildly on the beforementioned furious brunehilda or diving for the wed ding ring of martins stina is difficult to decide perhaps her thoughtful gentle though sportive spirit may not be better displayed than in a walk with her lover and selfelected tutor olof nordevall on the banks of the silja olof gazed on the rivers playful windings on the distant mountain veiled in an azure mystic shadow and he thought on siri for that landscape with its changing physiognomy was to him as an image of the charming enigmatical maiden who continued more and more to occupy his mind his heart was now softened towards her for he called to mind her late acqui escence and her tears as he then went on and thought he began to bear delicious notes of a rute they played one of those northern melodies in which a sad seriousness is pervaded by i know not what touching innocent joy and every close has a moriendo in which the tone does not seem to terminate but to disappear like a spirit in space which goes to continue its song upon another shore deeply was olofs soul now smitten by these notes and by this holy still lifethe life of dalarnawhich he seemed to drink in from them the young man became warmed and eltvated in spirit and it seemed to him as if some deep and beautiful secret of existence was about in this moment to be revealed to him lie knew well that the siren who called forth these tones was no other than siri and be followed them in order to discover her he soon descried her where she lay in the soft grass by a verdant sepulchral mount near the riverbank wild rosebushes which in certain districts so richly adorn the margin of the dalilf budded around her and the elk durathor shook as he lay at her feet his little bells as he already at a distance heard sume one approaching

said she  then i will play more for you she played again some melodious measures and then said  do you know what these are  that is the song that the water spirit by ifusby sings at night as he sits on the rock at the waterfall above the mill the words are  and i hope and i hope that my rleleemer liveth ah i how gladly would i hear him when be sings this and he actually sits there at night and sings said olof smiling while he seated himself on a little hillock opposite to siri yes so they say answered siri hesitatingly i know well that others say that it is all superstition but then much must be superstition which is right beautiful and which sounds like truth for example tell me something more about these things said olof familiarly  for example about the cairnpeople continued siri  do you know what dwells in the cairn here  they are the cairn people for the sepulchral mount is a spirithouse and when we on a summer evening lay ourselves down beside such a mount we hear the music within they are the cairnpeople who play on their harps and sing laments over their captivity and call on men for salvation if you promise it them then they play blithely the whole night through but if you answer them you have no redeemer i  then do they dash their harps to pieces amid lamentations and remain silent in the cairn and do you know that in the springs live maidens who are very beautiful but who are captives and beneath their silver roof long for the day of judgment for then shall they be free they are dumb and look very sorrowful and roll slowly their eyes and shed large tears yes in all streams and lakes in mountain and wood are these beings found who are captive and who seek after release ah olof how do i pity all these and gladly would i liberate them i have often felt and feel it again at the present time bow hard it is to be in thraldom and only think to be so all life long  and sin stooped her face into her hands and wept  but my sweet child represented olof  all these beings over whom you grieve are the offspring of phantasythey do not exist  yes so many people say answered sin but i know nevertheless that in some way or other they do exist although i cannot explain how often when i am out alone by day or bi night i think that i will talk to all around me and that all shall talk to me and that i will get to understand about it yes i cannot tell what hinders but it seems to me often as if i am bound and need a deliverance  then should i understand every thing and be good and happy ah olof  my mind is often very strangely affected and when i see then any thing in nature which suffers or which is ruinedwhich dies then do i long to be able to help it  and it distresses me that i cannot  god knows my little sister whence you have got all these melancholy phantasies of nature i think that all in nature is glorious and perfect  yes sometimes it does seem so  but i have seen deeper into it and there is much that is evil and repulsive i

the conventions and limitations of the theatre who runs may    see that it not only contains dramatic situations but is a play in all save name and externals instead of acts it is divided into three books  everything in it suggests the stage  so that point on the authority of the saturday review the athenaeum and the bookman may be taken as settled and in determining upon its actual form the athenaeum thinks mr henry james has chosen the better partthat he has saved much that is supremely delicate in touch much that shows the most sensitive care for the right distribution of light and shade and many fine distinctions in tones and manners which would have lost focus and significance in the glare of the footlights from possible misapprehension and misinterpretation the writer of the very able article which the saturday devotes to the work discerns in it the assumption of a second manner in this dramatic method of construction however he points out the obvious drawback that  there is room for very little of the daintily whimsical commentary upon his characters their looks and thoughts and motives and amiable absurdities which he knows how to make so delightful also the same critic finds the cultivated indirection of the authors style less appropriate when it is merely a question of supplying the physical links in a chain of earnest and momentous dialogue the morning post finds in the book a breaking down of that aloofness which hitherto has stood between mr jamess readers and any warmer feeling than genuine admiration the present novel is forcible and passionate  1 the other souse new novels by henry james 2 vols heinemann ho runs should yet possibly may not read between the lines in mr jamess new novelmay not see that it not only contains dramatic situations but is a play in all save name and externals instead of acts it is divided into three books and the interest continues to deepen steadily till the final crisis it reads as though the author had at first conceived it in no other light than a play but had afterwards as it were recoiled from the ineptitudes and vulgarities that on the stage are often the ruin of the best dialogue action and incident considering the state of the drama in spite of many important improvements we cannot blame him for eschewing the ordeal in leaving  the other house as a very notable and distinguished piece of work he may even be congratulated on having chosen the better part those who best know mr jamess qualities and the shortcomings of theatrical impersonation may agree that he has not improbably saved much that is supremely delicate in touch much that shows the most sensitive care for the right distribution of light and shade and many fine distinctions in tones and manners which would have lost focus and significance in the glare of the footlights from possible misapprehension and misinterpretation short of being actually witnessed with the bodily eyesight the other house by the skilful arrangement of its events and figures should become by a mental adjustment on the part of readers equivalent to a dramatic performance in it mr james has actually touched the heart of life more closely and more persistently than in his recent works where the action sweeps relentlessly forward to the tragic conclusion which on this occasion he makes no attempt to blinkthere can be but few digressions and hesitations quiet and restrained as are almost all the scenes the thing palpitates with the emotion belonging to a work of art that has been cost and fused in one supreme effort mr james has abandoned his ordinary method of working about and around an idea his actors by their every word and gesture advance instead of retarding the action and interest there are three men three women and a child  though last a most important though passive instrument in their hands on this child hinge directly or indirectly the fates of the rest of the group the first book contains as it were the prologue and subtly suggests the coming clash of interests and affections a necessary interval of a few years does not interfere with the sense of unity in the piece the second book again discovers the same characters in the same place under slightly altered conditions hut intensified and dominated by the same impulses in the third the catastrophe and its consequences untie the knot and scatter the actors we have said that it is a story of human interest and passion but at the same time we may add that a feeling of artificiality is present in the play of repartee the verbal parryings the purposes and cross purposes mr james has been very ingenious very admirable in the intensity he has thrown into many of the scenes and situations it is a grim drama indeed that in spite of this masquerading is played out in the small provincial town the end of the child the fashion of its taking off is horribly realistic more obscure and less tangible are the workings of rose armigers mind and yet in a manner but too clear and definite  novel notes the other house by henry james 2 vois heinemann had mr james the idea of making this story into one of his charming plays  everything in it suggests the stage or rather his own methods of playwriting in the first volume the actors seem to move to and fro to speak and refrain from speaking in accordance with laws which are not those recognised by fiction we seem to look and listen rather than read we are puzzled and go on hoping for the enlightenment of the next act rather than go back for suggestions we have missed the scene in the dcing wifes room which we only know by the reports of the doctor and the agitated but not alarmed husband moving now within to her and now out to us gives us exactly the feeling of the stage so does the dramatic reappearance of dennis vidal the treatment is novel and by its very artificiality it keeps us on the alert and yet we doubt if any reader will guess quite accurately the conclusion no one would venture to think mr james would lead up to an obvious end yet the story has rather an obvious end only with highly original circumstances it ends in a tragedya very ugly tragedy everything was tending to it but we thought mr jamess fastidiousness would avoid it but no he merely avoids the scandal attaching to it there is only one character that is dull and ineffective but she is kept so purposely that though we may guess at her slumbering passions we may not know the dark possibilities which are to flash out in crime the others are perfectly conceived and developed especially that clever and admirable british matron mrs beever and the subtle the exaggerated the charming tony with his  dashed sociability  and his unconscious power of drawing womens love like mr james himself we are inclined to huddle away the terrible last act and dwell on the tragicomedy that is played so cleverly till near the end  the other house by henry james in 2 vols heinemann after a considerable interval devoted to experiments in other forms of imaginative literature though short story and the play mr henry james gives us a new novel we can but open it in some trepidation will devouring time have robbed nothing of the keen psychology the subtle portraiture the cunning evolution that have delighted us so often a very early scene dispels such a fear the sweet roman hand is at work in the first interview between rose armiger and dennis vidal with its delicate swordplay its exquisite indication of crosspurposes and the clash of standpoints like mr meredith mr james hos always before him the problem of rendering through the medium of mere words more than the mere words of a diologue to put its very intonation the atmosphere of it on the pagthis is the ideal which he often comes so near achieving like mr meredith and yet with how greot a difference os a rule in the solution but is it a mere fancy to perceive in the present novel the influence of the one living master of english fiction who could have taught anything to mr james  do not some flashes of meredithian intensity break the unruffled lucid calm of mr jamess familiar manner does not tony bream owe something in conception at least to victor durance the other howe compels admiration but it also strongly compels protestthe very protest itself perhaps only another tribute to the vitality and persuasiveness of mr jamess puppets but surely in the figure of rose anniger subtlety hos been pushed beyond the borders of enigma wo oro accustomed to the impassive masks of mr jamess heroines when we get though keynote the inexplicabilities generally arrange themselves into a sufficiently logical whole but we submit that in rose armiger the burden of interpretation laid upon the reader is too heavy for him to beor it is to make bricks without straw even after the denouement going back over the earlier scenes with perhaps more patient analysis than a novel may fairly claim we are still unable at certain points to see what in homely phrase the woman is driving at there is one passage which we can only make intelligible to ourselves by the somewhat bold process of emending the text we should be gratified to mr james if he would tell us whether we ought not on the eighth line from the bottom of p 196 of vol ii to read hate her  for take her of course the change inverts the meaning of the sentence it is possibly because we frankly find rose armiger such a puzzle that the denouement itself with its sudden revelation of the resourceful triumphal woman as a criminal of an especially revolting and not even very plausible kind fails to convince us almost offends us we cry out against it it could not be so  we feel that mr james had no right to enlist our sympathies even in error for the woman  to give us no hint and then at the end to submit us to such outrage we close the book with something of emotional disturbance as well as of intellectual perplexity but it is an astonishingly clever and interesting book for all that,unmarked

describes the manners and customs of these benighted heathens as an officer of the salvation army might naturally be expected to describe them in this case i cannot help thinking mr lang has allowed

street st jamess a lady whose beauty brought round hera crowd of admirers and whose past history and her mode of life were a source of gossip to fashionable people dwelling in the neighbourhood of the court that she was lovely no one denied that she was much sought after was a fact well known to the chairmen of the court district artd the loungers of whites and boodles that she deserved her popularity was a question which grave and pious persons answered stoutly in the negative lier face and form caused her to be pointed at in the parks as a truthful reproduction of the princess de lamballe in the heyday of her loveliness but the ladys personal charms were not the only attractions which nightly filled her drawingrooms it was not unusual for indigent women of fashion in the last century to keep private gamblingtables at which guests were expected to render homage to chance and beauty at the same time to good people of this generation it may seem scarcely credible that little more than halfacentury since ladies could be proprietors of drawingroom  hells and yet be countenanced by people of good repute such however was the case when george the third was still a vigorous king when adverse fortune compelled a woman of tonne to shift for herself if she had the requisite knowledge of the world and a connexion with people of the right sort she would open a farotable and look for the support of her old associates in her new calling just as a reduced lady nowadays would seek the aid of friends in an attempt to establish a fashionable boardingschool or in endeavours to place herself in any other honest vocation of the many ladies who thus fought the battle of life at the close of the last century none was more admired or talked about than mrs norland of york street a pleasant mystery surrounded the lady it was rumoured that she was the daughter of a village schoolmaster had in girlhood figured amongst the frail beauties of the palais royal had enjoyed the friendship of philippe galite and as the wife of a certain major norland1 had passed some years in india nabobs whispered that major norland had disappeared mysteriously from his post in british india leaving his wife to shift for herself whether the major was still living no one knew  but for all practical purposes mrs norland was a widowfree to please herself alone in accepting and returning the flatteries of many lovers and in no way restrained by considerations of wifely duty mr locker has placed this character on his canvas with great skill the doubts and scandal of her past life aud the temptations surrounding her career as the keeper of a fashionable gamblinghouse neither cause others to speak of her with angry censure nor make her forgetful of selfrespect in spite of baneful educatkm and a demoralising occupation she is a womanly and rightminded creature lovers seek her hand but she keeps them at a distance evening after evening she entertains her patrons and patronesses  displaying a pair of lovely arms and delicatelyshaped hands as she turns up the cards whilst  her face is invisible hidden behind an envious blue domino and it is an affair of conjecture amongst her supporters why she does not yield to one of her many rich suitors and become the wife of a wealthy husband instead of persisting in the exercise of a precarious business amongst her more ardent admirers is sir goodwin anerleya rich baronet who having been a courtier in his youth is at sixty years of age the head of a great commercial house in the city a widower with two charming daughters whose love affairs form an important part of the story prosperous and honoured the stately baronet who is an excellent type of the london gentleman of a hundred years ago falls madly in love with the siren of york street according to the fashion of the day he addresses her in language of fanciful sentimentality but his passion is pure and loyal this is sir goodwins folly the old man loves as young men only ought to love madly and without regard to prudence from the moment when the baronet and the lady are brought together the interest of the story turns on the question will they marry i and this interest is cleverly maintained till the close of the third volume the positions of the lover and amanda are constantly being changed and the readers anxiety to know the end of the wooing is heightened by each change of circumstances all that relates to this main current of the tale mr locker has managed excellently frederick starlinghurst the welldescendedrowis a personagewho eouldnot have been portrayed by a writer not conversant with the world of existing society as well as with the life of george the thirds town the baronets daughters are excellently drawn and their prim severe but kindhearted governess is an original creation ably also haa the author caught the political spirit of the churchandstate men and of the disaffected classes the costume manners and amusements of the period are in like manner set forth with no ordinary power the painstaking fidelity of the artist being apparent in the social descriptions although he never burdens his pages with extracts from his notebook the story however has important faults and blemishes which it would be wrong to pass without notice instead of confining himself to the history of sir goodwins folly which affords ample material for three volumes of writing mr locker has crowded his scenes with characters and having brought them on the stage has with wearisome conscientiousness expended labour in making them say and do much that in no way promotes the action of the drama young beginners observed haydon of artstudents are apt to intrude all  they know not considering that the first requi  site is to please the eye through the eye  a  mnltiplicity of parts distractsdisgusts weakens  i hence thc necessity of one thing being kept  subordinate to the other so that the mind may j dwell on as much at a time as it can

the development j of  sir goodwins follya story by the way i peculiarly susceptible of treatment by writers  for the stageand avoided superabundant j characters and burdensome digressions we j should have spoken of his novel in higher j terms as it stands however sir goodwin folly belongs to the superior grade of prose fiction and we lay it aside with a feeling that its writer may produce a better book  sir goodwins folly in this story mr locker occupies ground which although not wholly new to the writer of fiction has perhaps been made less use of than we might have expected the period of the french revolution and the fearful and sanguinary events connected with it have it is true formed the staple of nmany french stories and as in mr dickenss  tale of two cities found a way into english fiction but the agitation caused by that mighty event in england though of an infinitely milder character the outer ripples of the surface of society here caused by the casting of that modem babylon the capital of france into the sea of revolutionary outrage which nevertheless inaugurated a new epoch of european progresshave never been very enmphatically noted by writers of this class on our own side of the channel the matter may possibly have been thought hitherto more pertinent to the province of the historian than the novelist but in its social aspect it is manifestly not wholly unadapted to the purposes of the latter mr locker impressed as it appears with this view opens his narrative in the midst of the period referred to in 1795 when among certain sections of the people in this country and certain political circles most unmistakeable signs were evinced of a tendency to fraternise with revolutionary france but these circles and parties were of two very distinct characters while one undoubtedly such as that headed by fox and other distinguished public men applauded loyally the principles upon which the revolution was commenced another in a lower stratum of society was prepared to go to almost any length in admiring advocating and even adopting the practises of the revolutionists between these might probably be reckoned a third class represented by such men as horn tooke thelwall and other members of the london corresponding society who to a respectable station and intelligence united a more intimate knowledge of and sympathy with the classes below them both in their wrongs and sufferings despite indeed the ferocious loyalty which surrounded the throne ad ostentatiously displayed itself in the house of commons and the squirearchy in general so deep was the

again insistently  what is art   in one sense annie e holdsworth mrs leehamilton from photo by elliott axd fry 55 baker 8rcet of the word the author has given it to us openhandedly in another the worst that can be said is that she has perhaps played tricks with our taste but even this we do not wish to believe if art may be defined as the employment of things to answer some special purpose the use of means to accomplish some end surely a fair enough definition then miss holdsworth has undoubtedly succeeded in giving us art she has used legitimate means to produce a delicate and absorbing book there are many rules in art but the main question once settled this author may be trusted not to violate single rules in the valley of the great shadow there are twelve chapters and these contain six deaths and three severe illnesses yet in many ways the book is a cheerful book and besides this it is terribly true mittenplatz the beautiful swiss valley isdespite its being the spot 1 where death and life waited together for the bodies of men bright and bracing and of perennial interest 1 when the snow flashed in the sun like silver and the jodels rang cheerily across the silence people forgot the sadness of the mittenthal but at night they remembered for then life slept and only death watched yet there were generally hopeful faces and smiles and sunburn that looked like health and gaiety and music with the great solemn white hills teaching calmness and patience the hotel royal where the men and women of this story live during the months in which we learn to know them is a real place no reader will doubt it we know its rooms with the sunshine on the windows its balcony with the row of chaises loxgues its stairs with babette toiling up and down and in this snowy valley and this homelike hotel we see a group of men and women fulfilling their destiny music abd harmony are in the book from end to end and the most dominant themes the most resonant insistent notes are courage and love which are greater powers than death and life such phrases as d the bells on the horses tossed the silence in little drifts about their heads such overfantastic phrases displease occasionally and are to be deplored but the book itself is not fantastic in style it is indeed singularly free from complexities and obscurities it contains wise and leautiful writing and is in spite

with the curious combination of lungdisease and lovemaking we have not carefully enumerated the cases of engagements to marry and of deaths from chest complaints they alternate throughout the book and the leading medical man is not exempt for some reason or other the clerical element is not represented in the dramatis persona there is a disagreeable man who says  if a woman is not a fool she is a liar and if she is neither she is a confounded nuisance he too suffers ultimately from one of the two prevailing complaints there is a plainspeaking young american lady who is described as coming from kansas though she appears to have more affinity for philadelphia and there is an impossible or abnormal child which serves no good purpose in the story on the whole the volume is hardly equal to others by the same hand such as the gods arrive or  the years that the locust hath eaten though experience has added facility to the writers style  the valley of the great shadow by annie e holdsworth

toboggan out of this world because she is hurt in her selfrespect and disappointed in her affections and then when we are asked to weep over what may be called  dodo pathosthe giddy mother and the

with a conspicuous absence of the more obvious faults that seem inseparable from such writing which is a way of saying that miss manns volume does not fall into the list of mediocre work yet there are inferior passages scarcely to be expected of one who in such a book as  susannah showed a happy sense of proportion and of the general fitness of things the material of susannah was handled with even greater freshness and discrimination and the amount of humour and original observation was also in excess of anything found here still there is much to be thankful for in the cedar star of the early days of the rectory children we have nothing but good to say this part of though story is artistic in the right sense of the word the children aro delightful and certainly give the impression of having been taken on the quick the gifted people who know how to reproduce the curious phases the nothings that are everything in the glory and the dream of childhood are rare indeed but fortunately not increasingly rare who reads may note some recent examples of the powor and in the cedar star there are proofs that miss mann belongs to the strictly limited company the three childrenbetty emily and jan but especially bettywith their troublesome behaviour quaint pastimes and shrewd remarks and their lovingkindness to the lower creation are if not exactly of the kingdom of heaven of the kingdom of real childhood they are at least a wellindividualized and lifelike trio their brother the insectloving peter is not so clearly focussed but though surroundings of the motherless children their passively selfish yet affectionate father the pets of the establishment the quarrels reconciliations animosities friendships and especially the conversations have all the charm of mingled divination and experience there is something about the ungoverned yet lovable ways of the little people that makes them at once amusing and pathetic the excellent caroline their fathers second wife and the sister of their staunch friend and ally the rev bill carlyon is the portrait rather than the caricature of a typical englishwoman the wellordered routine in which the poor lady is anxious to involve the young jervoises who have run wild under inefficient governesses and servants is of course little appreciated by the victims bill carlyon always indulgent to the whims of his adorers and tormentors is placed in difficult situations yet his stalwart honesty and real kindness stand him in good stead there is a certain conventionality of treatment in this muscular christian but he is very likable in spite of it the villain of the piece is not exactly overstrained still where the rest are distinctly in the picture he strikes one as being now and again a good deal out of it the beginning of the book is most decidedly the best of it bettys womanhood is far less attractive than her childhood though though author has been clever in evolving her on the same lines sundry episodes towards the close are too melodramatic to suit the note struck at the beginning but the real human nature and the clever expression of it are very noticeable points  the cedar star by mary e m 6i hutchiaon when a book is all about one person its interest naturally depends entirely upon what kind of person that one is this book is all about bettyit might be called 1 the betty book and betty is undeniably interesting she is unconventional to a degree and therefore as a child delightful unconventionality in a grown woman is less admirable and leads to situations which are neither artistically elegant nor morally inspiring and the grownup betty is disappointing but as a child she is entirely satisfactory all the more so that she is persistently the reverse to her governesses her stepmother and all other tiresome people with wellregulated minds betty had a curious and rare habit of looking things straight in the eye for herself regardless of canon and of acting and speaking directly from the conviction so reached regardless of convention the world was her oyster and she chose to open it without any ingenious patent tool picked up secondhand at the nearest ideamongers though she tore her feminine fingers sorely in the effort she was selfish passionate domineering a prey to sudden gusts of temper and of emotion but withal generous brave and true as steel we like her best with timid

selfish beyond all bounds yet at heart capable of much that is good we will not say anything of the plot except this that it shows how betty progressed through suffering to selfrepression and a more instant love of her fellowbeings mrs mann sees with sympathetic eyes and writes well here is a description of a visit of betty and her sister to carleton billy the curate who is afterwards to play so

thoughtfulness which the writer brings to matters of conduct and character that are as a rule unhappily believed to be hardly worthy of thoughtfulness the age suffers from a superfluity of minor

equality with their great enemies the tribes of the north who already possessed iron weapons realmahs ideas upon warlike matters and his mode of conducting battles and sieges resemble advanced

touching mr helps has bestowed much trouble in giving an appearance of truth to his story by inventing a language for his lake people of which he supplies a rather copious vocabulary also he gives os many of their proverbs which though far beyond tupper are not quite equal to those of king solomon the history of how realmah became king his war his policy his successes and his sorrows are set forth

is that in every page he is in the society of persons who have a true and noble reverence for each other  realmah itself may grow tedious being full of abstract politics a didactic exposition of the

B1152,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it

madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold

tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,unmarked

and earnest eloquence she died upon the verge of womanhood cut off in the very springtiae of her beauty and of her intelligence how great a loss the world sustained is seen now in the succession of posthumous works which her sorrowing friends have published which she with the modesty of genius supposed to be unfit for the public eye because they did not come up to her own ideal standard of excellence but the welcome that has been given to all of them and their undoubted merit shows us what she would have been had it been the will of providence that her genius should ripen to maturity god however thought otherwise and took her pure and holy spirit to himself the daysof bruce is another of her fictions a composition of her early youth but full of beauty her purpose in this story is to depict and develop the character of woman in vamious situations of trial in isabella of buchan we have a picture of a heart wounded in its affections but trustful and hopeful in its misery in isoline the selfinflicted unhappiness of a too confident and selfreliant nature and in agnes  the overwhelming of a mind too much akin to heaven in purity and innocence to battle with the sorrows that beset her path of life guacie aguilan knew the female heart better than any writer of our day and in every fiction from her pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of the motives and

then the reader will lay down the volume with regret mrs nehtox crotand better known perhaps as caiiilla toomxin states in her preface to lydia a womans book that her design was to depict certain phases of life  from a womans point of view and that in doing so she has sought chiefly the approval and sympathy of her own sex the story like all of mrs croslands productions has a wholesome moral

review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his

B347,"['6552281', '9237628']",  the dwale bluth hebditchs legacy and other literary remains of oliver madoxbrown author of  gabriel denver edited by w m rossetti and f hueffer london tinsley brothers 1876 the results of the brief literary life of the author of gabriel denver illustrate one not uncommon phenomenon while they are an exception to another the son of an historical painter this wondrous boy for he was but twenty when he died was an instance of the not unfrequent union of pictorial talent with rare gifts of literary description precocious as a child he had never say his biographers up to the time of his death  so much as left for many weeks together the shelter of his paternal roof only for a couple of years before he entered his teens does he seem to have attended even a dayschool yet his work exhibits a lively negative to the saw that homekeeping youths have ever homely wits  and whether we examine his extraordinary juvenile watercolours or study the romances into which more than into his paintings he threw inherited  qualities of prompt solid realistic invention and dramatic force and directness it is impossible to help marvelling at the breadth of his observation the keenness of his eye for scenery and natural forms and objects and the retentiveness with which he husbanded for use as occasion served the sights he saw and the facts he noted at sixteen or thereabouts after singular successes in watercolour painting he wrote the black swan as it is given in the second of these volumes the original draught of his gabriel denver which was published in 1873 by messrs smith and elder he had thought it out and those who take the trouble to read it will be struck by its strong imaginative power and sustained force of passion when he was yet but fifteen like an aeschylean drama in its limited dramatis personae the black swan has but three actors on its scene which is mostly the burning wreck of a tasmanian emigrant ship a strongwilled halfeducated settler his unloved desperate wife and the girl whom gabriel denver idolises and who clings to him in life and death with a sort of mesmeric fascination there are some bits of this extraordinary tale eg gabriel denvers dream from which he wakes to a gradual discovery of the ship being on fire his jealous wifes doing and that wifes previous overhearing gabriel and lauras lovemaking upon the deck while they remain as utterly unconscious of her presence  as a bird is of a lynx which is hidden in the foliage waiting for a spring   or again in the crisis of the black sivanjs fate the description of the way in which fire and water clear away all the live figures from the burning deck except a trio  physically held together as the author puts it  by the ties of passion the hatred and love which entangled them mentally which must be owned to be of grand conception and the phenomena of the ocean on which they drift in an open boat for three or four days in its rest and its disturbance as well as of hunger and thirst in their gradually developed stages betoken a conscientious study of records of like adventures not always to be found in young authors of rich imagination the writer of such a tale may have resolved to forsake the brush from other motives than  some restive idiosyncrasy  forbidding him  to tread the paternal vestiges perhaps he felt a constraining sense that the canvas fails to tell a whole tale with the breadth and detail and ample verge of the written romance anyhow he dedicated himself to literature the dwale bluth a devon synonym of the deadly nightshade arose out of a five weeks visit to lynmouth and its environs in 1871 and shows inter alia the grasp with which young madoxbrown fastened upon a congenial subject the weird region of the yethhounds the dartmoor legend of the logan stone tanta rabobs huxen or the devils ankleblade and the tradition of a family bold and mad enough to cherish an ancestral dwelling beneath the latter furnished him with a theme sufficiently full of loves and hates and marriages and misadventures to supply ample food for a thrilling tale of wonder and terror into this tale the aspiring author throws two ingredients

the readableness of the third hebditchs legacy though we do not think it as clearlydrawn or as attractive this may be due to a more tangled plot and more shadowy characters perhaps too chambers in

and f hueffer with a memoir 2 vols tinsley brothers nothing is sadder than to find that the first fruits of early geniusas yet but half matured are the last results we shall ever get yet this will often happen the imagination so soon excited the nerves so highly strung are at once the cause of the promise in the present and of its nonfulfilment in the future the strain has been too great the sword has been too sharp no recent instance illustrates this so strongly as the brief memoir and fragmentary stories that messrs tinsley have published it was in the autumn of 1873 that a strangelooking book of a livid yellow binding with black figures of a burning ship and wreathing smoke and gnawing rats stamped upon the back appeared before the world it was easy for the critics to discern power in its graphic descriptions and in its vigorous language and to this j ustice was done but on the other hand there was a horrible plot and an exaggerated tone which at times became almost grotesque so that the impression finally left was one of repulsion and distaste for few of the readers of the tale were not aware that its author was still a boy and that  gabriel denver was written when oliver madoxbrown was but seventeen years of age had they known this the feeling of wonder and of hope would have been stronger than any other the volumes before us contain the first version of gabriel denver which bore originally the picturesque name of the black swan a name which the publishers with the same stupidity that insisted on altering hawthornes the marble faun into transformation changed into the present commonplace title the same unhappy influence also weakened the story itself by changing the jealous wife into a lover and by giving to the hideous plot an inartistically happy end of the memoir with which the volumes open there is nothing good to say two editors might between them one would think have given a sketch of this gifted boy which would have impressed itself on the memory as it is there are in all but twenty pages and of these about a third are with questionable taste taken up with the prattlings of his childhood and the ravings of his last delirium did he write no letters that might be quoted1 is nothing of his conversation when in health remembered 1 some memorial lines alone by mr philip marston which in their pathetic beauty recall cowleys elegy on mr william harvey seem to convey to us an idea of what oliver madoxbrown really was for the rest we have the barest facts he was born in 1855 when he was eight he began to paint in watercolour in 18g0 when only fourteen he was an exhibitor at the dudley gallery in 1871 he exhibited at the new british institution and in the winter of that year he turned his brush into a pen and wrote the black swan there came some unfinished romances which are here presented to the world and thenthe end in 1874 the poor boy died his brain active to the last still planning new stories or visited by strange visions of the stories before us the fragmentit is only a fragmentcalled  the dwale bluth  a local name for the deadly nightshade is decidedly the finest there is something about it which reminds us of the brontesbut of emily rather than of charlotte this resemblance which seems also to have struck mr marston is chiefly in the character of the incidents and the description of scenery while a certain introspective glance a certain mode of tracing out subtle analogies between the outer life of nature and the inner life of man recalls the still greater name of the famous american romancewriter the very way in which the dwale bluth clings to the hair and poisons the wearer seems to show its relationship to the flowers in rappaccinis garden or among zenobias tresses or by the grave which septimius had dug the story flows clearly along till the end of helens childhood then there i3 apparently a gap and although some other chapters are carefully written and highly finished they do not piece so readily with the first part and after all the tale remains unfinished the faults of the dwale bluth are scarcely noticeable among its rare merits but there is certainly at times an overelaboration in details and the reader might have been spared the unintelligible dialect of devonshire which requires a constant footnote of translation and which therefore adds nothing to the true colouring of the picture on the other hand what power there is in every page what imagination and at times what humour the early history of the serpletons the squire and his gypsy wife the parson with his knowledge of books and his ignorance of all besides the little halfgipsy helenall this is described with a precision and force that call up again unavailing regrets for what this wonderful literary faculty might hereafter have produced no extracts can in the least do justice to the impression which the entire story leaves upon the reader and the following are given only as showing something of the style and spirit in which the work is written   in the autumn examined from the bridlepaths across the distant heights serpleton house but for its pointed gables and the thin wreaths of smoke from its chimneysmight have been taken for one of those huge white fragments of rock with which the northern heights of dartmoor are strewn so wildly projecting from the hillside in a profusion of purple heather and golden furzeblossom in the spring the ancient appletrees along its unenclosed orchards grew radiant in the windy sunlight under the blue sky among the purple cloud  shadows but in the winter with the keen boisterous east wind heavy with mist and sleet driving across the sterile moorlands and whistling harshly through its crevices turning its chimneys and corridors into a monstrous series of organpipes and playirjg sinister tunes on themserpleton house must have looked dreary indeed for a human dwellingplace or take thisthe wild little helen who had once seen the dwale bluth before and was always by some mysterious fascination longing for it goes one day into the deserted garden and rests on the edge of a broken cucumberframe  of a sudden she started and leaned over the broken bars there was what she had been looking after for her downcast eyes fell with an instantaneous revival of interest on the tendrils of the deadly nightshade loaded with poison flowers and berries crawling stealthily round the inside of the frame or crouching ignominiously along the damp ground the traces of snailtracks went all over the bricks and mould and the leaves were bitten here and there but it was singular to note what a number of empty snailshells were lying among its foliage in spite of this it had grown into a goodly plant the dwale bluth is a cowardly creeper and knows no means of rising above the earth it springs from unless by insinuating itself among the leaves of some bolder parasite there it now lay beneath her gaze even throwing a grim and sinister reflection on to her darkcomplexioned face and into her eyes  there it lay at her feet prone and helpless as though it were entreating her to life it how strangely artistic is the touch which marvels at the empty snailshells though the plant was vigorous   hebditchs legacy is still more incomplete than the  dwale bluth and is less easy to follow it would probably have been as weird though not so picturesque a story and there are some of the finest isolated passages in it that can be found among all these fragments the description of the fog in the dying womans room with which  hebditchs legacy opens is hardly inferior to the stormscene in the other tale a curious instance only slightly more marked than many others of the way in which the trained perception of the painter could give reality to the writers scene occurs towards the end of this tale  but facing each other as the uncle and nephew were mr blackoder still had the advantage for he sat with his back to the light and his face was indistinguishable the only features really visible in it were the eyes which witching perhaps the dim reflection of the great silver ipergne glowed under their overhanging brows with a keen motionless gleam of the shorter stories and of the poems there is not much to say they show the writers versatility but they do not show him at his best still for one wild fragment we must find place it is obscure no doubt but it has a something of the ballad ring about it these tracies were descended from one of the murderers of beckett and so woe to the unborn aeons of the tracies  say what redemption is left through all time ob could they reach to the land where gods grace i baffled and faint with the storm winded embrace the wind that wails for their forefatliers crime with ever the wind and rain in their faces never again till the end of time and now as we close these volumesunfinished and immaturewe feel more strongly than ever that a great literary artist was taken from the world by this boys early death of course it is possible that as years passed a genius which was developed so soon might have faded away in the common light of every day but if it had grown with his growth oliver madoxbrown must have taken rank with the great masters of romance as it is we have only these broken remains and this totally inadequate memoir for the first there is now no help but as regards the second it is not too late to hope that the editors will give us such a life as may have both a psychological and a literary value,unmarked

not in flesh and blood to prove that he was a man and not a phantomm paul de la gironiere resolved to take up the penand we are glad he did so for we have gained by his resolution an original and

the chemisette is attached a variously coloured petticoat of very bright hues over this garment a large and costly silk sash closely encircles the figure and shows its outline from the waist to the

marched off and i intantly drove rapidly away in quite an opposite direcion from the soldiers the bandits looked after me ny good faith in keeping my word was successful i lot only lived a few months in safety at tierraalta ut many years after when i resided in jalajala md in my quality of commander of the territorial lorse guards of the province of lagune was natually a declared enemy ofthe bandits i received the following note  sir beware of pedro tumbaga we are invited by him to go to your house and to take you by surprise we remember the morning ive spoke to you at the cascades and the sincerity of our word you are an honourable man if we find ourselves face to face with you and it be necessary we will fight but faithfully and never after having laid a snare keep therefore on

soon let him have justice and without consulting the law a fortnight after my answer tumbaga was no more a bandits bullet disembarrassed me of him we doubt if any hero at the victoria could have done

little kingdom we will glance at these tagaloc the people over whom he had to rule  the character of though tagaloc is extremely difficult to define lavater and gall would have been very much embarrassed by it for both physiognomy and craniology would be perhaps equally at a loss amongst thc philippines the natural disposition of the tagal indian is a mixture of vices and virtues of good and bad qualities a worthy priest has said when speaking of them they are great children and must bo treated as if they were little ones it is really curious to trace and still more so to read the moial portrait of a native of though philippine islands though indian keeps his word and jetwill it bo believed he is a liar anger he holds in horrorhe comparts it to madness and even prefers drunkenness which however he despises he will not hesitate to usc thc dagger to avenge himself for injustice  but what he can least submit to is an insult even when merited when he has committed a fault he may bc punished with a flogging this he receives without a murmur but he cannot brook an insult he is brave generous and a fatalist the profession of a robber which lie willingly exercise ii agreeable to him on account of the lite of liberty and adventure it affords and not because it may lead to riches generally speaking the tagalocs are good fathers and good husbands both these qualities being inherent horribly jealous of their wives but not in the least of the honour of their daughters and it matters little if the women they marry have committed errors previous to their union they never ask for a dowrythey themselves provide it and make presents to the parents of their brides they dislike cowards but willingly attach themselves to the man who is brave enough to face danger play is their ruling passion and they delight in the combats of animals especially in cockfighting here was material of a somewhat unpromising natureand we are not certain that the first demonstration of the european was quite so wise and successful as the don himself appears to think even taking his own account ot it for gospel  two indians came one day to lodge a complaint against one of their comrades living at some leagues distance from jalajala these informers accused him of having stolen cattle after i had heard all they had to say i set ott with my guard to seie upon the accused and brought him to my residence there i endeavoured to make him confess his crime but he denied it and said he was innocent it was in vain i promised him if he would tell the truth to grant him his pardon for he persisted even in the presence of his accusers persuaded however that he was telling me falsehoods and disgusted with his obstinacy in denying a fact which had been sworn to me with every appearance of sincerity i ordered him to be tied upon a bench and receive a dozen strokes of a whip my orders were executed  but the culprit denied the chargas he had done before this dogged perseverance irritated me and i caused another correction to bc administered to him the same as the first the unfortunate man bore his punishment with unshaken courage but in the midst of his sufferings he exclaimed in penetrating accents oh  sir i swear to you that i am innocent but as you will not believe mc take me into your house i will be a faithful servant and you will soon have proofs that i am the victim of au infamous calumny these words affected me i reflected that this unfortunate man was perhaps not guilty after all i began to fear i had been deceived and had unknowingly committal an act of injustice i felt that private enmity might have led these two witnesses to make a false declaration and thus induce me to punish an innocent man i ordered him to be untied the proof you demand i said to him  is easily tried if you are an honest mau i shall be a father to you but if you deceive me do not expect any pity from me from this moment you shall be one of my guard  my lieutenant will provide you with arms he thanked me earnestly and his countenance lit up with sudden joy he was installed in my guard oh human justice how fragile and how often unintelligible art thou some time after this event i learned that b tilio de la cruzthis was the name of the manwas innocent man is liable to err and it is too often through the gates of wrong that rulers pass into the path of right our don seems to have had a more summary mode of dealing with the bandits who infested jalajala but alas for the novelty who has not seen the same experiment tried a thousand times with thc same success in a thousand nulodiamas  i frequently walked in the forests alone with my gun under my arm suddenly a bandit would spring out as if by enchantment from behind a tree armed from top to toe and advance towards nie laster said he to me putting one knee to the ground i will be an honest man  take me under your protection  i asked him his name  if he had been marked out by the high court of justice i would answer him severely   withdraw and never present yourself again before me  i cannot forgive you and if i meet you again i must do my duty if he was unknown to me i would kindly say to him  follow me follow whither m de la gironiere tells us to virtue and the church but with certain small concessions as we shall see to the old predatory instinct of his converts and followers  i found that it was necessary to provide some amusement compatible with the tastes manners and habits of my former bandits who had led for so long a space of time such a wandering vagabond life for this purpose i allowed hunting on all parts of my estate conditionally however that i should take beforehand as tithe a quarter of any stag or wild boar they should kill i do not think that ever a sportsmanone of those men reclaimed from the paths of vice to those of virtuefailed in this engagement or endeavoured to steal any game i have often received seven or eight

disposed in pictures and his virtuous and nappy villagers grouped as in the background of an opera  in vineyards copied from the south of france is rather the incidental result of his dramatic instinct than an impeachment of his sober truth we have no doubt that our don and the amiable donna anna his wife did much good at the colony of jalajala and we regret that his taste for storytelling has prevented him from setting down the practical details of his management such as those which render col dixons account of his doings at mairwara so interesting to the statesman and public writer the dons experiment at jalajala led him to explore the northern parts of the island of luzon perhaps his notes on the natives of these provinces will be considered by those who delight in comparing the manners of men as the most interesting in his work from these we can extract only a few curiosities here is an odd indian custom as regards divorce the tinguian has generally one legitimate wife and many mistresses but the legitimate wife alone inhabits the conjugal house and the mistresses have each of them a separate cabin the marriage is a contract between the two families of the married couple the day of the ceremony the man and wife bring their dowry iu goods and chattels  the marriage portion is composed of china vases glass coral beads and sometimes a little gold powder it is of no profit to the married couple for they distribute it to their relations this custom my guide observed to me has been established to prevent a divorce which could only take place in entirely restituting all the objects that were contributed at the marriage by the party asking for divorcea rather skilful expedient for savages and worthy of being the invention of civilised people the relatives thus become much interested in preventing the separation as they would le obliged to restitute the presents received  and if one of the couple persisted in requesting it they would prevent him or her by making away with one of the objects furnished such as a coral necklace or a china vase without this wiso measure it is to be supposed that a husband with mistresses would very often endeavour to obtain a divorce among king pauls own subjects the tagaloc the method of wooing and wedding was ancient and peculiarevery tagal jacob having to earn his rachel as the hebrew patriarch won his bride marriage says m de la gironiere  is preceded by two other ceremonies the first of which is called tain manock tagal words signifying or meaning the cock looking after his hen therefore when once a young man has informed his father aud mother that he has a predilection for a young indian girl his parents pay a visit to the young girls parents upon some fine evening and after some very ordinary chat the mamma of the young man offers a piastre to the mamma of the young ludy should the future motherinlaw accept the young lover is admitted and then his future motherinlaw is sure to go and spend the very same piastre in betel and cocoawino during the greater portion of though night the whole company assembled upon the occasion chews betel drinks cocoawine nnd discusses upon all other subjects but marriage the young men never make their appearance till the piastre has lieen accepted because in that case they look upon it ns being the avantcourrierthat is the first and most

spaniards did their best to suppress this custom on account of the inconveniences it entailed very often the father of the young girl in order to keep in his service a man who cost him nothing keeps on this state of servitude indefinitely and sometimes dismisses him who hat served him for two or three years and takes another under the same title of pretendant or lover but it also frequently happens that if the two lovers grow impatient for the celebration of the marriage ceremony for  hope deferred maketh the heart sick some day or other the young girl takes the young man by the hair and presenting him to the curate of the village tells him she has just run away with her lover therefore they must be married the wedding ceremony then takes place without the consent of the parents but were the young man to carry off the young girl he would be severely punished and she restored to her family here we may pause our mark is on many another passage of this curious volume but we have

fought with enthusiasm and enthusiasm they have always inspired whenever they have been either written or talked about by any thing with a heart better than a split block or a condemned dead eye much of this high feeling is indigenous and inherent in the british animal itruns in his blood he is pugnacious for the mere pleasure of fighting and generally victorious from the mere est with which he sets about thrashing his enemies now all this is very well but were it not for other considerations would be prone to degenerate into brutality and ferocity and the warrior would be converted into the savage it cannot be expected nor is it perhaps desirable that the refinements of education should polish the subordinate class of seamen to which we allude nor have they as yet very extensively had that effect but other and very powerful causes have been in operation which have elevated the mere instinct of courage to the noble sentiment of heroism and taught the british sailor that respect for himself his hardships and his privations that have brought all the noble virtues in their train among which the beaming forehead of mercy has ever shone conspicuously this elevation of character this feeling of superiority that exists in spite of his ignorance and in the midst of his isolation from the rest of his species so characteristic of the british seaman we hope we may still say of the present day arises almost wholly from two causes the first the example and the influence of his officers the second the inspiriting and elevating stimulus of nautical literature with the first cause on reviewing this work we have nothing further to do than to say that this stimulus has in a degree extended aft from the forecastle and the same song that has cheered the captain of the forecastle has not wholly been ineffective upon thc feelings of the captain himself mere nautical literature was at a very low ebb until the time of smollett  that vivacious witty and very graphic author was the first who turned the public attention to the physical singularities and moral idiosyncrasies of the sturdy british tar but he only described he sought neither to elevate or improve he pourtiaed with the fidelity ufa moreland and filth consequently too often made up the greatest part of the picture had it not been for his sterling humour the nautical parts of his writings would have been intolerable after this for the lapse of nearly fifty years jack was permitted to play the fool fight and conquer without attracting any notice to his mere personal and distinctive character he certainly had improved a little and but a very little and that improvement arose merely from the reflex of his superior officers even the stirring times and the menacing events of the parker mutiny drew little attention to the mass beyond securing to them a somewhat more liberal allowance and a grcuter protection from the caprices of tyranny classes of men like nations must have their peculiar literature before they can be justly described either as flourishing or much better than semibarbarous as yet no generous writer had started fearlessly from the ranks of literary routine either to direct or do justice to the energies of the british sailor who consequently was generally regarded by his brethren of the sod as little better than a courageous brute at sea and a blustering fool on shore dibdin wrote and at once a halo of light danced upon the sailors brow the songs spoke to his heart humanised and ennobled it he now knew the value of his own bravery and consequently honoured the bravery of his enemy he affixed immediately a higher notion to the word duty  and his duty henceforward became his pride ami his pleasure these songs gave him principle and taught him patriotism they braced his heart in danger and softened it in repose riley did more they converted passion into sentiment and planted in his bosom selfveneration from that time jack was somebody and not only somebody but somebody of consequence also but still something also was wanting the more properly to elucidate his character and make the world acquainted with his sterling qualitiesin the detail and thus individually improve upon the opinion that the public began tohaveof him generally from the songs of dibdin as yet to the world at large he was nothing but an abstract idea though a noble one

she burst out acryingand blessed her child 1 never saw such a scene there was jane dripping wet lying along the floor she never spoke or cried  she was dried up by grief and there was her father the rough old fisherman whose life had been one struggle against the storms of heaven now beaten fairly beaton by a womans silent sorrow my mother had raised janes hoad and placed it on her knees whilst i stood behind my father endeavouring to shame my tears  well we got all hands to bed and the next morning 1 arose with the conscience of a man who has done a good act 1 was as light as a eork and skipped about like one of the figures we so in punchs box before we piped to breakfast i was on my road to susans which was about a hundred yards from our house she was up and received me very kindly  she saw i was in high spirits and asked me the reason  janes come back susan said i why what do you look so contemptuous about she is forgiven and youll come 1 know and see her and he her friend as you used to be   no no mr brace she answered   that i can never do think what the world would say if i was the friend of a bad woman  i should bo thought no bettor than she was no it must not be and i cannot consent to h ive a sistcrmlaw whose conduct has been so reprehensible 44 4 thats a long word susan said 1  and perhaps its a good one but it sounds like as much as to say you never will shake hands with my sister again  that you wont be ber friend now that she most requires it 44 4 certainly mr brace said she 4 that is what i mean 44 4 then vou never shall sav that von are mrs brace  and the sooner you are mrs tapes the sooner you may repent ot this ungenerous conduct 1 tell you what it is miss susan you see i came the captain over her 4 your beait is not in the right place or you would feel for one of your own sex ami rather endeavour to raise than to trample on her so goodbyc to you  we part company from this moment  and hereafter when that attorney bas cheated you out of your person and your property you will think oi the sailor the coxswain of nelson 44 theni took off my bat and making ber a proper bow lifting up let le to keep the balance even as i bobbed my bead

yet 1 know that 1 have done what is right i just took a last look and i saw her lift ber apron to her eyes then run into her house 44 4 there said 1 as 1 nearly run foul o the attorney 4 thin es a clear coast tor you to smuggle upon old tapes but use her well for she is a nice craft alter all and we part friends so tip us your flipper and good luck to von both   we have staid so long on the nile that wc have no time to dwell ow the more glorious and fatal victory of trafalgar which is told it possible in a still more powerful manner but brace has not all the burden of narration upon himself he has a queer devilmaycare sort of fellow occasionally his shipmate and messmate who now and then spins out a very funny yarn of his own this facetious companion rejoices and makes every one else rejoice in thc euphonious title of tom toprail toms marriage at portsmouth is perhaps thc most humorous certainly thc most ludicrous part of thc novel the general reader may perhaps think it overcharged wc can assure him that it is by no means so seamen of ardent temperaments after a long confinement on boan a manofwar when they first put their feet ow shore really become jovially insane and arc actuated by none of thc impulses common to their less exalted fellow creatures lt is not pride that impels them to these ludicrous displays ot riding outside coaches with streamers flying and tiddlers scraping they know at the time that it is abominably foolish but wc arc inclined io think that they are moved to these absurdities more bv a spirit of mad daring than by any other impulse whatever may be the cause the tacts arc ridiculous enough and arc intolerably more disgusting in their actual perpetration in chainiers description they arc not only farcical but grotesquely humorous without ever departing from thc actual fact as these displays gradually becoming more untrcqucnt w ih through the improvement of thc seamans morah soon altogether cease and bc matter only of history

notice a discrepancy that we cannot exactly explain if 1 baner nodded surely the 44 last of the agamemnon may be allowed to take a nap in the second volume ben tells us very shortly that being a cripple in june 1800 he went down to iosport ami married susan she then being with some children the widow of the lawyer tapes well being a married man he then tries back and after much yarning spins us out most excellently the battle of trafalgar which battle crippled him well in the third volume coming up with the body of nelson and performing a prominent part at the funeral ceremonies according to his late lordships request he repairs immediately to merton communicates with lady hamilton and then goes down not to iosport but to rochester to see his wife and had the satisfaction of finding a warm heart and a warm cottage ready to receive him we hope that this is all right for the sake of bens veracity for we should almost break our hearts if we found him tripping but we really cannot find as he never left the hotly of his old friend until it was interred how he could have possibly got married to susan after he became crippled for in another page he says explicitly thus 41 my duty drove mc to him who had ever been my friend and when my heart beat right again 1 resolved to obey his last command and go to merton lv yet 1 had not seen my wife for she was living near toetester on fifty pounds a year c thc mistake that ben makes about the seals on tackles secret papers is still more egregious but as the acute lawyers and counsel did not find it out in the memorable trial of brace reruns hawk wc shall also let it slip by in silence had we not mentioned these trivial errors so beautifully do wc think that captain barnier has done his work and so candidly do we express our opinion of its excellence that our notice would have appeared fulsome in its encomiums enough of this the fifty pounds a year permitted to bens wife as long as the seals of tackles secret remained unbroken are found to be insufficient to support the wife and family decently so brace becomes and glories in the metamorphosis a ireenwich pensioner all this part of his life is rich and genuinely

document in the presence of the executors is to bc burned unread and then the fortune to go to braces wife brace gets into an omnibus to go up to town with this momentous seal of course unbroken but

envelope which was his ow n with his ow n seal sealed but unfortunately sealed immediately over the seal of the tapescrian document so in removing the one the other is broken adrift and thus to all appearance the fortune is lost as the interdicted seal is now to all intents and purposes broken and so almost is bens heart not for his own sake but for the sake of his wife and children he meets the executor with a small squad of lawyers one of whom is the heir providing the conditions of the will have not been complied with ben knowing of the mishap is wary and will not produce the document

B1100,"['8957194', '6810283', '3179671', '8892761', '6796313']",  the way of all flesh the way op all flesh by samuel butler 11th impression of 2nd edition fifield 6s 6d net the appearance of a new impression of  the way of all flesh  in mr fifields edition of samuel butlers works gives us an occasion to consider more calmly the merits and the failings of that entertainnig story like all unique works of authors who stand even to the most obvious apprehension aside from the general path it has been overwhelmed with superlatives the case is familiar enough and the explanation is simple and brutal it is hardly worth while to give it the truth is that although there is no inherent reason why the isolated novel of an author who devotes himself to other forms should not be  one of the great novels of the world the probabilities tell heavily against it on the other hand an isolated novel makes a good stick to beat the age it is fairly certain to have something sufficiently unique about it to be useful for the purpose even its blemishes have a knack of being sui generis to elevate it is therefor bound to imply the diminution of its contemporaries yet apart from the general argument there are particular reasons why the praise of  the way of all flesh  should be circumspect samuel butler knew extraordinarily well what he was about his novel was written intermittently between 1872 and 1884 when he abandoned it in the twenty remaining years of his life he did nothing to it and we have mr streatfeilds word for it that  he professed himself dissatisfied with it as a whole and always intended to rewrite or at any rate to revise it we could have deduced as much from his refusal to publish the book the certainty of commercial failure never deterred butler from publication  he was in the happy situation of being able to publish at his own expense a book of whose merit he was himself satisfied his only reason for abandoning  the way of all flesh  was his own dissatisfaction with it his instruction that it should be published in its present form alter his death proves nothing against his own estimate butler knew at least as well as we that the good things in his book were legion he did not wish the world or his own reputation to lose the benefit of them but there are differences between a novel which contains innumerable good things and a great novel the most important is that a great novel does not contain innumerable good things you may not pick out the plums because the pudding falls to pieces if you do in  the way of all flesh however a compere is always present whose business it is to say good things his perpetual flow of asides is pleasant because the asides are piquant and in their way to the point butlers mind being a good mind had a predilection for the object and his detestation of the rotunder platitudes of a greek chorus if nothing else had taught him that a cornerman should have something to say on the subject in hand his arguments are designed to assist his narrative  moreover they are sympathetic to thc modern mind an enlightened hedonism is about all that is left to us and butlers hatred of humbug is though a little more placid like our own we share his ethical likes and dislikes as an audience we are ready to laugh at his asides and on the first night at least to laugh at them even when they interrupt the play but our liking for the theses cannot alter the fact that  the way of all flesh  is a roman d thises not that there is anything wrong with the roman d theses if the theses emerge from the narrative without its having to be obviously doctored nor does it matter very much that a compere should be present all the while provided that he does not take upon himself to replace the demonstration the narrative must afford by arguments outside it but what happens in  the way of all flesh   we may leave aside the minor thesis of heredity for it emerges gently enough from the story besides we are not quite sure what it is we have no doubt on the other hand about the major thesis it is blazoned on the title page with its submalicious quotation from st paul to the romans  we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the necessary gloss on this text is given in chapter lxviii where ernest after his arrest is thus described  he had nothing more to lose money friends character all were gone for a very long time if not for ever but there was something else also that had taken its flight along with these i mean the fear of that which man could do unto him cantabit vacuus who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already  let him but be able to earn his bread and he knew of nothing which he dared not venture if it would make the world a happier place for those who were young and loveable herein he found so much comfort that he almost wished he had lost his reputation even more completelyfor he saw that it was like a mans life which may be found of them that lose it and lost of them that would find it he should not have had the courage to give up all for christss sake but now christ had mercifully taken all and lo t it seemed as though all were found as the days went slowly by he came to see that christianity and the denial of christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do it was a fight about namesnot about things practically the church of rome the church of england and the freethinker have the same ideal standard and meet in the gentleman  for he is the most perfect saint who is the most perfect gentleman with this help the text and the thesis can be translated  all experience does a gentleman good it is the kind of thing we should like very much to believe as an article of faith it was held with passion and vehemence by dostoevsky though the connotation of the word  gentleman  was for him very different from the connotation it had for butler butlers gentleman it should be said in passing was very much the ideal of a period and not at all quod semper quod ubique  a very victorian antivictorianism dostoevsky worked his thesis out with a ruthless devotion to realistic probability he emptied the cornucopia of misery upon his heroes and drove them to suicide one after another and then had the audacity to challenge the world to say that they were not better more human and more lovable for the disaster in which they were inevitably overwhelmed and though it is hard to say  yes  to his challenge it is harder still to say  no in the case of ernest pontifex however we do not care to respond to the challenge at all the experiment is faked and proves nothing it is mere humbug to declare that a man has been thrown into the waters of life to sink or swim when there is an anxious but coolheaded friend on the bank with a 70000 litebelt to throw after him the moment his head goes under that is neither danger nor experience even if ernest pontifex knew nothing of the future awaiting him as we are assured he did not it makes no difference we know he cannot sink  he is a lay figure with a pneumatic body whether he became a lay figure for butler also we cannot say  we can merely register the fact that the book breaks down after ernests misadventure with miss maitland a deplorably unsubstantial episode to be the crisis of a piece of writing so firm in texture and solid in values as the preceding chapters ernest as a man has an intense nonexistence after all as far as tjie positive side of  the way of all flesh  is concerned butlers eggs are all in one basket if the adult ernest does not materialize the book hangs in empty air whatever it may be instead it is not a great novel nor even a good one so much established we may begin to collect the good things christina is the best of them she is on any standard a remarkable creation butler was  all round  christina both by analysis and synthesis she is wholly his he can produce her in either way she lives as flesh and blood and has not a little of our affection  she is also constructed by definition if it were not too awful a thing to say of anybody she meant well the whole phrase gives exactly christinas stature alethea pontifex is really a bluff  but the blurt succeeds largely because having experience of christina we dare not call it mrs jupp is triumphantly complete there are even moments when she seems greater than mrs quickly the novels that contain three such women or two if we reckon the uncertain alethea who is really only a vehicle for butlers very best sayings as cancelled by the nonexistent ellen can be counted we suppose on our ten fingers of the men theobald is well worked out in both senses of the word but we know little of what went on inside him we can fill out christina with her inimitable daydreams  theobald remains something of a skeleton whereas we have no difficulty at all with dr skinner of roughborough we have a sense of him in retirement steadily filling the shelves with volumes of skinner and we know how it was done when he reappears we assume the continuity of his existence without demur the glimpse of george pontifex is also satisfying  after the christening party we know him for a solid reality pryer was halfcreated when his name was chosen butler did the rest in a single paragraph which contains a perfect delineation of  the oxford manner  twenty years before it had become a disease known to ordinary diagnosis the curious may find this towards the beginning of chapter li but ernest upon whom so much depends is a phantoma dream child waiting the incarnation which butler refused him foi twenty years was it laziness was it a felt incapacity  we do not know but in the case of a novelist it is our duty to believe the worst the particularity of our attitude to butler appears in the fact that we are disappointed not with him but with ernest we are even angry with that young man if it had not been for him we believe  the way of all flesh  might have appeared in 1882 it might have shortcircuited  robert elsmere j m m poetry ano time warton lecture on english poetry ix by sir henry newbolt for the british academy humphrey milford ls net the haunting thought of time and transience and the desire for immortality are the stuff of which much of the worlds poetry is made  how the days draw in   is the lament of the anacreons  but they will draw out again the platonists and the christians hopefully reply  draw out indeed to an interminable length there are some who love the earth so well that the only fault they have to find witl lite is its shortness to others this existence is a horrible exile from a fatherland that lies somewhere remote and radiant beyond the bounds of time sir henry newbolt regards the poet as being almost by definition an exile homesick for eternity after showing what has been the attitude of different poets towards the whole problem of time he ventures to suggest to the future poet a new way of envisaging this first and gravest of questions the poets of the future must follow sir henry newbolt and professor mctaggart in regarding time as an illusion  they will be optimistic and encouraging about the destinies ol the world because the future is to be  a progressive manifestation of the eternal now this is one way of disposing of time but there are others the poets of the future may quite as justifiably regard time not as an illusion but as the most fundamental of realities life moves and has its being in time  transience and death are the conditions of existence lt may be that the poets of the future will cease to bewail their exile from a problematic eternity and will rejoice in the incessant movement of a force which is for ever creating and destroying and building again but the poets of the future may safely be left to solve the problem for themselves meanwhile we have to thank sir henry newbolt for a most suggestive lecture on a theme which might with profit be developed at greater length  the way of all flesh by samuel butler a posthumous wrork by the author of  erewhon a note tells us that it was begun in 1872 and that the author was engaged upon it intermittently until 1884  it is therefore to a great extent contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be taken as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book though story deals with an english family which had risen from obscurity and extends over about twothirds of the nineteenth century lt is deliberate philosophical and thoroughly characteristic of its author richards 6s  the way of all flesh bv samuel butler 6s grant richards nobody who is acquainted with mfr samuel butlers former works would look to him for a novel written on popular lines and the wav of all flesh  is as little like the conventional novel of the moment as it was possible to make it it has no intricate plot almost no plot at all for that would have savoured too much of artifice and mr butler had set himself to reveal in these pages the life history of four generations of the pontifex family and did it with a fearless realism and a keen irony and simplicity of style that for purposes of comparison send one back to fielding and swift for its chief interest the book relies and safely relies on its characters who are drawn with remarkable skill and with a profound knowledge of humanity a few pages suffice for a vivid and complete presentment of old mr pontifex who is seventy odd at the beginning of the nineteenth century a quaint rugged village carpenter something of a painter and musician with a gift for organbuilding drawn in more detail is his son george who goes early to london into the business of an uncle and is byandbye partner in an important publishing firm the unfolding of his personality is a fine piece of work  even more so are the subtle developments of georges second son cutlhbert and later of cuthberts son ernest the women of the book are rendered with equal truth they are neither idealised nor distorted but presented simply unflinchingly in the colour of actual life and with all the frailties of humanity it is a novel that has indubitable elements of greatness it is full of a shrewd somewhat cynical philosophy and mellow worldly wisdom and grows upon the reader with an increasing interest because of its strong but unexaggerated human appeal  new novels the way of all flesh by samuel butler i grant richards this posthumous story may be unattractive to the ordinary novel  roader it opens casually it lacks form it has no sensational climax and no heroine it is not a

of his subject he says boldly but sometimes too fiercely what many are thinking you may not take his views of life but you will learn something from examining them his irony is a useful dissolvent

kind by a unique man  fiction the way op all flesh by samuel butler grant richards this posthumous tale by the author of  erewhon  is not really the latest of his works a prefatory note by mr r a streatfield tells us that it was written between 1872 and 1884 and then laid aside with the intention that some day it should be rewritten it is extremely characteristic of mr samuel butlers individual temperament and outlook upon life whimsical and discursive in method racy in expression and full of satire which is often genial and occasionally to our taste at least a little acrid according to mr streatfield the work was largely contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be regarded as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book we regret that we do not recall what mr butlers precise theory of heredity is what the way of all flesh chiefly illustrates is the antagonism of the generations and its satire is mainly levelled at certain more or less unconscious views of parental responsibility which the author detects lurking beneath the moral pretensions of the british bourgeoisie they may be summed up as  willbreaking  at that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod was to spoil the child and st paul had placed disobedience to parents in very ugly company if his children did anything which mr pontifex disliked they were clearly disobedient to their father in that case there was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take it consisted in checking the first signs of selfwill while his children were still too young to offer serious resistance if their wills were  well broken in childhood to use an expression then much in vogue they would acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture to break through till they were over twentyone years old then they might please themselves  he should know how to protect himself till then he and his money were more at their mercy than he liked the narrative for mr butler is nothing if not biographical carries us through the history of several generations of pontifexes it is upon the head of the rev theobald pontifex who has the misfortune to be a priest as well as a parent that the vials of the authors scorn are most liberally poured and the story culminates in the career of the rev theobalds son ernest the will of ernest pontifex is broken in youth he grows up with an extreme ignorance of the world which lands him first in prison and subsequently in a most undesirable marriage finally he touches earth like antaeus in the bitterness of experience and rises up to be a man and hate his father a philosophical doctrine as to the formation of character by personal experience seems to be at the bottom of the book but it must be observed that ernest pontifex was much helped in the task of recovering his balance in life by the receipt of an unexpected legacy of 70000,unmarked

B5176,['6810414'],  tugeru aram wthat has mr wills made of bulwers idea  what will mr irving make of mr willss version of i eugene aram were questions much mooted when we last glanced at what the theatres were doing they were answered on the seventeenth of april when the new play was produced at the lyceum before a crowded and sympathetic audience with every accessory of scenery decoration and costume which the most fastidious admirer of realism could desire mr wills has made a few interesting tableaux out of what bulwer executed as a romance and conceived as a drama to which he doubted his own ability to do justice but he has not made a good play out of it any more than he reduced the readymade tragedy of the life and death of charles the first to the conditions of a good acting drama mr irving makes the most and the best of m1r willss tableaux but he is overweighted by the disproportion of his part and he has to struggle against the inherent unsuitability of the story of  eugene aram for representation on the stage at all unless it were given in its entirety mr wills claims to have adhered neither to bulwers romance nor to hoods poem and in a certain sense he has written his play independently of either though he has taken some of his effects from both it would however be clearly unreasonable to expect that this play should be considered on its own merits only and not to some degree with regard to its proportion to and relation with bulwers novel to which the murderer of daniel clarke owes his posthumous renown outside the records of the  annual register and the  newgato alendar thus considering it the question is naturally suggested why did not mr wills inspired by bulwers idea of a lonely student possessed by remorse and fear out of which he is only partially beguiled by love and whose fate comes up with him just as he is about to marry a beautiful girl refer to bulwers view of how the subject ought to be treated in a dramatic instead of merely adopting it in its romantic form  he had bulwers own exposition of his notions on this point and he had the  fragment of the drama which bulwer commenced but did not proceed with and they make it clear that the novelist perceived and appreciated the nature and uxtent of the difference between the romantic and the dramatic capabilities of the story of crime and misery which had strongly fascinated his imagination bulwer turned the drama into a romance mr wills has turned the romance into a drama in the face of the novelists careful demonstration of the vital distinction in fact the antagonism between the two the novel takes up the murderers life at the point where it is most adapted for description that is for the reverse of dramatic treatment but the  fragment takes it up at the point at which the dramatic element is in its full force that is when motive is most powerful and action most prompt the  fragment might never have been fashioned into a good play but any play founded upon the life of  eugene aram which departs entirely from the method of the fragment must necessarily fail to be a good play in this instance the dramatic instinct has deserted m1r wills and he supposes the existence of a state of consciousness on the part of the audience such as the novelist has it in his power to iniduce by description digression or suggestion but which it is the dramatists business to create we cannot imagine shakespeare bringing the guilty queen on in the first act in macbeth bemoaning herself and washing her hands in her sleep and then the unravelling of motive and the description of the murder of duncan all done backward in a frenzied soliloquy but we follow the skulking figure of rudge the murderer of his master and of his fellowservant through all the pitiful stress of his dastard fear and his remorse which is never repentance until the author of  barnaby rudge discloses the secret with a sense that the exigencies of romance are adequately observed the failure of this dramatic instinct renders the first situation in mr willss play weak and incongruous why should the marriage of the only daughter of the vicar of an important parish with a village schoolmaster be a matter of rejoicing to everybody the vicar included  only it would appear in order that mr wills may not adopt the reasonable side of ibulwers story of a romantic girls love for a learned recluse not divided from her by a hopeless inequality of station while he equally with lbulwer does depart from the fact that euene aram had a wife living at the time of his detection in the revelation to his wife of arams crimeits motive and its perpetration having been made plain to the audience by a prologuethere would have teen an opportunity for the exhibition of true dramatic power in both author and actor an opportunity far more worthy than the declamatory incoherent selfaccusation at the feet of a bewildered girl to whom her moody lover has ever been a problem imposed upon mr irving in a scene impressive indeed demanding the utmost exercise of the actors peculiar skill but which elicits no spontaneous response apart from the tribute of admiration due to that skill because it is untrue to the facts to nature and to the previous indications of the piece in the soliloquy which follows the entrance of eugene aram it is certainly implied to the audience that the remorseful man is in love for the first time in his dark and mysterious life and one of the strongest points of analogy between mr willss play and bulwers romance consists in the conviction entertained by ruth meadows that she is eugenes first love just as a similar conviction delights and satisfies the sentimental madeleine lester of the novel but this theory maintained to the end in the one instance is abandoned in the other in a fashion which is destructive to the ideal of the murderers character as it is put forth in the first scenes it is difficult to believe that the play was written otherwise than piecemeal that the story of the motive for the murder of clarkewhich is neither that imagined by bulwer nor that which really actuated eugene aramwas not concocted for the purposes of the concluding scene so discordant is it with all that precedes it the defect of the play as a composition is the absence of any indication of a previously or actually existing passion in the man to whose past so terrible a history attaches which can explain or account for that history like bulwer mr wills rejects the view of eugene aram as a common thief and assassin but he displays nothing like equal skill in the substitution of a supposed motive for the real one bulwer went as near to the palliation of the murder committed by the schoolmaster as the ingenious representation of an idee fire a devouring passion for learning and the revolt of a gloomy morbidly selfconscious mind against the poverty which fettered all its movements could enable him to go in the  fragment as well as in the novel but mr wills following neither has failed to explain the eugene aram who comes upon the scene a melancholy man indeed but whose melancholy according to his own subsequent explanation of its cause would have barred the approaches of the passion of love that ilulwers eugene aram should have possessed an emancipating angel in madeleine lester is intelligiblehis crime had nothing to do with a woman that mr willss eugene aram should have fallen in love with the parsons daughter is inconceivable his crime having been inspired by the base deception of a woman and his remorse kept alive if he could have forgotten the woman and the crime well and good but he never does forget and the discord makes the whole thing unreal the want of dramatic proportion affects the other characters as well they have no individuality apart from their relation to eugene aram parson meadows is a singularly credulous not to say silly old gentleman with an accommodating indifference to social distinctions which we are inclined to believe was less common in england in the last century than it is in this and so deficient in perception that he could hardly claim with hamlet to know a hawk from a handsaw considering the facility with which he invites houseman one of the most ruffianly ruffians ever produced upon any stage to join the family party on the day before the wedding of his daughter dr primrose is a smart man compared with mr willss parson who has a number of pretty speeches to deliver about arams gentleness and tendt ress about his putting the worm in his path into a place of safety releasing imprisoned birds and winning his pupils hearts they are very pretty speeches indeed there is a good deal of prettiness in the play and a little real poetrybut the gentleness and tenderness of eugene aram have to be taken for granted he is from first to last under the absolute dominion of remorse his love is more full of self pity than of passion his self absorption does not yield to the wouldbe joyous influence of the occasion while yet there is nothing to excite the ever latent fear in his breast it is difficult by the way to conceive a more inconvenient fatherinlaw elect than mr meadows for a man whose dread of the mere passing presence of a  stranger  is so great that the mention of the arrival of such a person suffices to distract his attention from the pretty protestations of his bride on the eve of their wedding here again mr wills while adhering to a portion of bulwers conception of the situation neglects a material constituent in it the murderer in the romance knows who it is who is lurking about threatening to reveal his secret to boland lester but the murderer in the play displays terror at the extremely natural occurrence that it stranger has introduced himself to the notice of the vicar of knaresborough and yet he is wholly unprepared to find that the stranger is houseman his former accomplice again in the story of the dreaded and threatened exposure mr wills is in accord to a certain extent with bulwer but not far enough bulwers aram is a comparatively rich man at all eventshe is in a position to make the coarser villains scheme of clhantage feasible but the village schicolmaster who is going to marry the parsons daughter has no money to be bullied out of and is a likelier subject for the tactics of conciliation which has an eye to the future the concluding scenes which are unlike either the novel or the facts are constructed entirely with regard to the characteristics of mr irvings acting they are made for him as exclusively as his costume is made for him and they become him as well this is in this particular case interesting but it is not drama and in the end we believe it is a system which will be found to be as injurious to the actor as it is unjust to the dramatist it is the most infallible method of encouraging mannerism that could be pursued not mannerism in the higher sense of characteristic conception and rendering but the mannerism which is as often as not mere affectation and which lends itself readily to the purposes of burlesque it dispenses the principal actor in a liece from the finer kind of observation while it taxes his energies in one direction it leaves a whole set of faculties without demand upon them in another it tends to drive him into exaggeration on the one hand and on the other into the carelessness which comes from the absence of comparison and by placing every one else at a disadvantage it deprives him of legitimate assistance pieces made to order in this way are to true dramatic writing just what zuccheros pictures were to really artistic portrait painting in the present instance to only one person besides eugene aram is any interest even supposed to attach it is to ruth meadows his betrothed a part by no means illplayed by miss isabel bateman but hopelessly ineffective because endowed with no vitality except that of the circumstances inconsistent and unnatural because ruth is merely a reflet of eugene arams moods and characteristics bulwer took care to establish an interest in his readers minds for madeleine lester to depict her in strongly individual colours and to sketch her life and associates before he plunged her into the deadly peril of love for an undetected criminal to tell all about her enthusiasm her lofty visionary mind and the studentfancies she holds as faith but that a parsons daughter whom we meet as an ingenue presiding over a village choir lauded by her gardener as the household angel a being of white muslin blue ribbons poetry and posies should mingle the most innocent and orthodox piety with a declaration that if eugene arams hand were even stained with crime she would still regard him with the passionate worship which he has inspired is unnatural and unpleasant not only or chiefly because the sentiment is at variance with every principle on which her life has been trained with every other to which she gives expression but because there is no reason for its suggestion except the authors absorption in eugene arams supposed state of mind and his inability to shift himself to that of any other person however comparatively important in the drama so as to give consistency or vitality to the other characters it is no wonder that miss isabel bateman is artificial and constrained all through she has a most unmanageable lover to deal with one so totally selfengrossed that she is made to appear as she must feel an interruption whenever she is not merely a chorus and the fact is that the only real chance she gets of producing any effect of signifticance is during the brief interval when eugene aram is off the stage in his case also by far the most effective scene is that in which he is quite alone when in the churchyard the murderer in his unbearable agony of remorse makes abject confession to heaven the dramatist puts forth the best that is in him the sense of interruption and incompleteness is lost in that solemn scene full of breathless interest the solitude of the guilty soul isolated by its incommunicable grief is broken by the only commune which has no discord in it and for the first time the legitimate condition for the employment of crime as a motive of dramatic action the inspiring of pity and of fear is fully attained mr henry irvings acting in the character of eugene aram is quite up to public expectation he plays the part with wonderful minuteness elaboration of detail and variety of expression considering the limited range of the emotion and its terrible profundity the slight demand for subtlety in the earlier scenes because every one is perfectly willing to be deceived and the complete surrender of the later scenes in which the presence of houseman in one and that of iruth meadows in another is of no practical account he is unreasonably suspicious and uneasy and preoccupied all through the first scene with ruth but that is the fault of the text he has to interpret  the fine touches in the interpretation the despairing glance over the girls head as it lies on his breast the vague absent smile and the lapse into thought far away from her even while the love words are on his lips and the caressing hands are touching her the writhing under the torture of praise and love in the address from his pupils as it is inflicted by the lips of his bride the shrinking from the pretty details of the weddingall these are his own in the agony and terror of detection in the morbid dread of the poor remains of the man he has slain in his dreadful question to houseman  diditstir  throughout the whole of the concluding scenes mr irving displays increasing power and intensity of expression but the situations are unduly prolonged and in the concluding scene in the churchyard he has too much ground to cover it is impossible to follow him through the contortions of that final agony without feeling that physical effort has too much place in it that it is suffered to divide the attention of the audience with the terrible mental struggle destined to end in utter defeat and death in a proportion which injures the effect of the whole in that one instance only the play is better than the interpretation the words are faultless the action is overdone many other passages of considerable beauty adorn mr willss play but they do not suffice to rescue it from the sentence of mediocrity as a dramatic composition that it is very much better than many plays with which the public have been satisfied of late years is not weighty evidence in favour of either the play or the public but we are far from accepting  eugene aram as the best that mr wills can do the author of  medea and the man o airlie and even of charles the first with all its faults as a drama ought to produce lieces which certain actors should aspire to perform not only pieces which aspire to be percormed by certain actors in the inversion of the roles of dramatist and actor there is the decadence of both arts,unmarked
