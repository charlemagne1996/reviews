B384,['6662944'],  fiction love in old cloathes and other stories by h c bunner downey  co this is a pleasingly illustrated collection of stories chiefly in the light comedy vein full of the little sentimentalities and prettinesses which characterise one kind of transatlantic fiction the late mr bunner was always a deviser of quaint expedients and the tale which gives its title to the book is a piece of modern lovemaking done in the style of pepys it says much for the authors skill that the result is successful for we hpve found the archaic rendering of slang infinitely amusing in french for a fortnight  a sabbatarian clergyman is betrayed into joining a sunday fete of french new yorkers and there and then repents of his  narrowness  the chromatic uncle is a pleasant sketch of an older new england  fend the uncle himself who was no uncle after all but only a certain tommy biggs is a character worth knowing on the whole we prefer mr bunner in his lighter moods r but one at least of his graver stories  has high merit crazy wifes ship is the tale of a prim old woman who deliberately cuts herself off from her neighbours and the little fashions of the place for the purpose of preventing her daughterinlaw from hearing of her husbands death she is compelled to forego the wearing of mourning in which her soul delighted and take upon herself a reputation for imbecility but when at last the girl dies the old woman crosses to the mainland and returns with sufficient mourning clothes to last her to the end of ufe the story is admirably told the village idiom is racy and expressive and the pathos is all the stronger from the studious reticence the red silk handkerchief  is a variation on the old theme of the lover who for long dreams of his mistress and then is rudely awakened by meeting her on her wedding tour the thing is well enough done in its way but the final scene is so old and stale that it fails to touch our jaded emotions better is a letter and a paragraph a curious forecast of a happy future which a poor and unknown man writes to a friend on the eve of his death last of the seven comes a story of revivalism in the backwoodsthe country of theron ware and his iuuminationwhere  an aged bishop stills the nervous excitement by the repetition of parts of the prayer book somehow the story seems just to miss its due effect and the final picture has awkward suggestions of the comic which spoil its dignity the truth is that bishop waldegrave is too histriohic a figure to convince and his speech savours of the religidus novel of our forefathers we like the author best when he indulges in pure comedy but the whole book is readable and entertaining,orthamerica
B3753,['8927354'],  the tents of wickedness by miriam coles harris sidney appleton this story may be fairly described as a lineal descendant with modern developments of the novels of e p roe so far as method is concerned the outlook is as ingenuously provincial and the composition of the narrative as artless as in  barriers burnt away and other works from the same pen a theological novel may easily have points of interest provided that the author brings a certain measure of accomplishment to the writing  but 4 the tents of wickedness in spite of several lurid glimpses into their deplorable recesses remains frankly tedious the story is extremely episodic and concerns the fortunes of a fair young girl who fresh from twelve years of convent life is thrown by a careless parent into the vulgar vortex of what appears to be intended for smart society but the outstanding motive of the work is of a sectarian character,orthamerica
B2599,['9178575'],  aunt philliss cabin or southern life as it is by mary h eastman philadelphia lippincott  co it is in the very nature of tyranny not to be able to bear being told that it is tyrannous you belong to me body and soul said louis quatorze to one of his household and if i tell you to leap into the rea you will be bound to do it the young noble bowed low and was retiring  where are you going to i asked the great king  to learn to swim sire returned the welldressed slave with a yet lower bow louis laughed at the joke though he was not a man to feel its pointyour owners of men body and soul in the great american plantations have lately been told to their faces with half the civilised world for audience of the words that their moral life isand must bea contradiction of itself so long as the mer i chandise in human beings is carried on by them the truth was outspokenclear ringing unmistakeableand they are of course angry and responsive mrs stowes narrative uncle toms cabin stands somewhat outside the usual barriers of fiction as a novelon the score of its art it is easy to find fault with it and when introducing it to the notice of our readers we ourselves pointed out its artistic defect lt is fairly a question too whether fiction is a sound vehicle for the conveyance of ethics and on that subject we have opinions of our own of which our readers have had the benefit more than once many however of even those who agree with us as to the principle will think that there are cases of exception in which its application may be waived in favour of particular circumstances  and many we know look on mrs stowes book as presenting one of these cases the authoress has guaranteed the authenticity of her facts and the truth of her characters and it is as a faithful picture of negro life in the southern states with its perils its romance and its temptationsits debasing tendencies and its utter want of morai logie  that this book is now having a reading throughout the length and breadth of the land in america and here it is in this sense also that it has been answered in books in magazine aud in newspapers the acceptance of the book in this country i is itself a literary fact of some interest our i advertising columns show that the sale is enor  mous we can scat edy count the number of editions that have appeared there ave lying  before us as we write a handsomely illustrated  edition for the boudoir and a sixpenny reprint  for the cabin with intermediate issues of various j sizes and prices one of these is announced j a3 the ninetyfifth thousanda second as the j thirtietha third as thc twentyfifthand so i forth there are possibly two hundred thousand  copies now circulating in the british islands i this success is not altogether personal  it is a national response to an appeal powerfully made in a great cause the book at the head of this article is one of the answers to mrs stow which have appeared on the other side of the atlantic it is also written by a ladya lady who appears to be familiar with the ways of negro life in virginia if not farther south mrs eastman is dogmatic and decisive she talks of the northerner with a freedom and a vehemence that would suggest nothing but gunpowder and thc bowieknife to the more peppery spirits of the other sex in a long preface to her story she defends slavery against all assailants as  gods own institutionand in a still longer appendix she derides and denies all the facts and points brought forward in mrs stowes narrative the laugh is certainly sometimes on her side she makes herself merry at the idea of uncle toms power of converting negroes  certainly the weak point of mrs stowes book and maliciously reminds the reader that cassy steals  money and tells lies after her miraculous con i version in the ginhouse she is still more dclighted to throw a lance at the  strongminded  women of new england and is particularly  happy in her sarcasms on the doings of a certain j female society for setting the world to itights j she even intimates that the strong minded will  not object to a little lying when it suits their i benevolent purpose as for example i  as regards the practice of marking negroes in  the hand i look upon it as one of the imaginary i horrors of the timcsa delusion like spiritual rap i pings got up out of sheer timidity of disposition i though i have heard of burning old women for  witches in new england and placing a scarlet letter i on the bosom of some unhappy one who had already j sorrow and sin enough to boar it wont do the  subject has without doubt been duly investigated i already id be willing were i not opposed to betting to bet my best collar and neck ribbon that a committee of investigation has been appointed consisting of twelve of bostons primmest old maids i and they have been scouring the plantations of the i south bidding the negroes hold out their hands not  as the poor souls will at first suppose that they may be crossed with a piece of silver and that they are now returning crestfal len to their native city not having seen a branded hand in all their journeying could aught escape their vigilance but they will say they saw a vast number and that will answer the purpose but these are points which we must leave the ladies to settle amongst themselves of course mrs eastman has no such slaveowner to show in her corps de ballet as legree because as she says no such monster ever lived except in the person of the northern professor who murdered his creditor for a mere matter of money  our readers shall if they please make the acquaintance of aunt phillis and her husband uncle bacchusthe last first notwithstanding the etiquette because the sketch gives us a full glimpse into negro life as the virginia slaveowners would have the world believe it now to exist  it was just sundovn but the servants were al at home after their days woik and they too were enjoying the pleasant evening time some were seated at the door nf their cabin others lounging on the grass all at cvse and without care jw any of their comfortable uibiiis had been recently v hunwashed and were adorned

infinitely overcome at the suggestion  my blessed grief miss alice said he  shed make me eat de bottle chaw up all de glass swaller it arter dat i aint ever tried dat yetbest not to i reckon no master i intends to keep sober from this time forrud till young master comes back it is thus throughout the slaves are weak a little lazy move than a little given to strong waters and their owners are uniformly mild affectionate and indulgent but listen to the story of aunt phillis the black heroine of this book she was a firm believer in the bible and often pondered on the words of the angel return nnd submit thyself to thy mistress she had on one occasion accompanied her master and mrs weston to the north where she was soon found out by some of that disinterested class of individuals called abolitionists in reply to the question are you free there was but a moments hesitation her pride of heart gave way to her inherent love of truth ill tell no lieshe answered i ama slavewhy do you not tale your freedomwas the rejoinder  you are in a free state they cannot force you to the south if you will tike the offer we make you and leave your master you are abolitionists i spose asked philliswe are they said and we will help you off i want none of your help said phillis  my husband and children are at home but if they wasnt i nm an honest woman and am not in the habit of taking anything ill never take my freedom if my master would give it me and the rest of us i should be thankful i am not going to begin stealing and i fifty years of age an eyewitness described the straightening of her tall figure and the indignant flashing of her eye also the discomfited looks of her northern friends i have somewhere read of a fable of iceland according to it lost souls are to be parched in the burning heat of hecla and then cast for ever to cool in its neverthawing snows although phillis could not have quoted this her opinions would have applied it for some reason it was evident to her mind for she had been well instructed in the bible that slavery was from the first ordained as a curse it might to her high spirit have been like burning in the bosom of hecla but taking refuge among abolitionists was from the many instances that had come to her knowledge like cooling in its neverthawing snows with mrs eastman slavery is all bedecked with flowers and besprinkled with rosewater it is sweet to the sense and consoling to the heart with her it is a beautiful and interesting thing to be a slaveand the worst that can happen to a quadroon or a negress is to gain her freedom one of the figures of her storysusanlistens to the abolitionists and gets entrapped into personal liberty but repenting thereof she begs to be made a slave againwhen her mistress makes an example of her and refuses to take her back this has been the prattle of men in all times in reference to the peculiar institution when burly old johnson poured out one of his scornful denunciations of slavery little boswell held up his hands in pious horror and declared that  to abolish the slavetrade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind listen to one little anecdote told hy mrs eastman pfirenthetically when she ceases for a moment to write fiction and rises into history  we have n servant woman named phillis her price is far above rubies her industry her honesty her attachment to our family exceed everything i wish abolitionists would imitate one of her virtues humility i know of no poetry more beautiful than the hymns she sang to me in my infancy her whole life has been a recommendation of the religion of the bible i wish my chance of heaven were half as good us hers she is a slave here but she is destined to he a saint hereafter we think mrs eastman here as in many another place where she thinks she is building an argument is very unconsciously giving it a dangerous side blow that is the fault of her materials the tools with which she works are sharpedged and they cut her own case  if mrs eastman received a visit from an angel would she like to detain the celestial stranger for a place in the sugar plantations or to put the case lower would she like to keep in bondage the heir to an earldom or principality knowing him to be rich and certain tc inherit his estate in due course or like the king who keeps a fool or the quack who hires a poet does sne think it respectable and in the way of business for a virginian planter to owr a saint  our readers will have seen by this time that this advocate for  god8 own institution is more earnest than adroit she means to put in a good word for the lords and masters of the southbut her nonadmissions and su gestions support in a remarkable manner the conclusions which on this side of the atlantic most people would draw from the perusal of such works as  uncle toms cabin,orthamerica
B569,"['6821525', '3174998']",  rose macleod fiction by alice brown archibald constable and co ltd 6s  rose macleod  is less a novel than a series of interesting psychological studies thrown into narrative form the scene is laid in america and the time is the present  but neither time nor place has any important bearing on the story itself throughout the book incident is felt to be of subsidiary importance to characterisation and miss brown has succeeded in creating two or three at least unforgettable types her characters frequently repel but they always interest and they always ring true we must make an exception however in the case of osmond grant over whom the author has lavished considerable pains but whom it is impossible for the reader to visualise as a human being he appears indeed as divested of many of the attributes of humanity his deformity of body coinciding with a sublime monstrosity of mind he is an ideal of splendid masculinity as conceived by a sympathetic woman not a man that may be met and known it is in the delineation of her minor characters that the art of miss brown challenges our admiration madam fulton and electra aie neither of them attractive characters indeed it is difficult to say which is the more repulsivethe flippant worldliness of the old woman or the graceless and sterile perfection of the young girl but miss brown has enabled us to realise the essential tragedy underlying each existence and our sympathy is perforce evoked when we read of  florrie dying in the presence of her elderly lover still clutching with eager fingers at some new and untried delight or of electra going forth on her futile mission to meet the inevitable disillusionment and bitterness ot failure rose herself is one of the most delightful heroines that we have yet encountered but to marry her to osmond is to spoil an otherwise irreproachable novel  rose macleod by alice brown 6s constable you 1o not remember mliss alice browns stories for any mystery or intricacy of plot or violence of sensation but because of the charm and quaint quiet humour of her style and the easy lifelikeness of her characters it is these same qualities that unfailingly delight you in rose macleod taking a handful of more or less ordinary people miss brown shows them in their homes scattered within reach of each other on a new england countrysideold madam fulton who has outlived a modest sort of distinction as a very average novelist and yearning for a little fun has just published a volume of recollections more or less imaginary that are booming her into fame madams coldly beautiful serious purposeful granddaughter electra who attends lectures and likes to fuss about importantly and take a hand in  movements billy stark the publisher over on a visit from london the excellently gentle lovable grannie grant who keeps the farm near by her bighearted shrinking hunchback grandson osmond her younger grandson peter a brilliant artist who has studied in paris and new york has sold a great picture and comes home crowned with honour and of course rose macleod the daughter of a notorious labour agitator in whom she has ceased to have any faith and the daily lives of these people open out before you until you are as intimate with them and as keenly interested in their loves and hopes and fears as if they were actually alive and you knew them in the flesh it is a story that might be true about men and women who are as real as if they had been drawn from life a book that is wholly pleasant to read and fragrant in remembrance,orthamerica

B910,['9181321'],  the petrie estate by helen d brown osgood mcllvaine  co this is a fairly commonplace story about a lost will which is eventually discovered without any evil consequences to the heroine who loses the property only to gain the hero who acquires it the heroine deserves her wealth as she employs it in improving the slums of new york on the most approved cos principles and what is more remarkable in a novel she does not lose her charm by so doing it is a short story but even so there are several irrelevant characters who might well be spared the chief merit of the bookwhich comes rather as a surprise at the end as the story is throughout told in a somewhat dull unemotional style is a really excellent love scene the author seems distinctly to realise the immensity of true love and quite rises to the occasion 44 there seemed all at once no necessity about anything they were suddenly in possession of all time or rather they were transferred to new space where time was not duty was not words were not this is truly and excellently expressed,orthamerica

this victim of misguided attachment   on returning to the inn i learned the whole story of the deceased it was a simple one and such as has often been told she had been the beauty and pride of tiie village her father had once been an opulent farmer but was reduced in circumstances this was an only child and brought up entirely at home in the simplicity of rural life she had been the pupil of the village pastor the favourite lamb of his little flock the good man watched over her education with paternal care it was limited and suitable to the sphere in which she was to move  for he only sought to make her an ornament to her station in life not to raise her above it the tenderness and indulgence of ker parents and the exemption fruin all ordinary occupations had fostered a natural grace and delicacy of character that accorded with the fragile loveliness of her form she appeared like some tender plant ot the garden blooming accidentally amid the hardier natives of the iields   the superiority of her charms was felt and acknowledge by her companions but without envy for it was surpassed by the unassuming gentleness and w inning kindness ot nei numiiers it might be truly said of her  4 u this is the prettiest lowborn lass that erer kan on the greensward  not li ing she does or seem but smacks of something locater than herself too noble for this place   the village was one of

pervaded this village pageant but above all with the dawning loveliness ofthe queen of may it was the village favourite who was crowned with flowers and blushing and smiling in ll the beautiful confusion of girlish diffidence and delight the artlessness of rural habits enabled him readily to make her acquaintance he gradually won his way into her intimacy aid paid his court to her in that unthinking way in which voun officers are too apt to trifle with rustic simplicity 4 there wa nothing in his advances to startle or alarm he aever even talked of love  but there are modes of making it more eloquent than language and which convey it subtilely id irresistibly to the heart the beam of the eye the tone f the voice the thousand tendernesses which emanate from t very word and look and actionthese form the true eloquence of love and can always be felt and understood hut never described can we wonder that they should readily win a heart young guileless and susceptible  as to her she loved almost unconsciously she scarcely inquired what was the grow ing passion that was absorbing every thought and feeliiisitor what were to be its consequences she indeed looked not to the future when present his looks and words occupied her whole attention  when absent she thought but of what had passed at their recent interview she would wander with him through the green lanes and rural scenes of the vicinity he taught her to see new beauties in nature he talked in the language of polite and cultivated life and breathed into her ear the witcheries of romance and poetry  perhaps there could not have been a passion between the sexes more pure than this innocent girls tiie gallant figure of her youthful admirer and the splendour of his military attire might at first have charmed her exe but it was not these that had captivated her heart her attachment had something in it of idolatry she looked up to him as to a being of a superior order she felt in his society the enthusiasm of a mind naturally delicate and poetical and now first awakened to a keen perception of the beautiful and grand ofthe sordid distinctions of rank and fortune she thought nothing it was the difference of intellect of demeanour of mariners from those of the rustic society to which she had been accustomed that elevated him in her opinion she would listen to him with charmed ear and downcast look of mute delight and her cheek would mantle with enthusiasm  or if ever she ventured ashy glance of timid admiration it was as juicklv withdrawn and bhe would sigh and blush at tne idea o her comparative unworthiness  her lover was equally impassioned but his pasion was mingled with feelings of a coarser nature isle had begun the connexion in levity  for he had often heard his brother officers boast of their village conquests and thought some triumph ot tiie kind necessary to his reputation as a man of spirit but he was too full of youthful fervour his hart had not vet been rendered sufficiently cold and selfish by a wandering ad a dissipated life it caught fire from the very hame it sought to kindle and before he was aware of the nature of his situation he became really in love miat was lie

forbade him to think jf matrimony but when he looked down upon this innocent clng so tender and confiding there was a purity in her fanners a blamelessness in her life and a beseeching mo aesiy in her looks that awed dowrn every licentious feeliiu l vain did he try to fortify himself by a thousand heartless examples of men of fashion  and to chill the glow of generous sentiment with that cold

hastening to the tomb but looked forward to it as a place of rest the silver cord that had bound her to existence was loosed and there seemed to be no more pleasure under the sun if ever her gentle bosom had entertained resentment against her lover it was extinguished she was incapable of angry passions and in a moment of saddened tenderness she penned him a farewell letter it was couched in the simplest language but touching from its very simplicity she told him that she was dying and did not conceal from him that his conduct was the cause she even depicted the sufferings which she had experienced  but concluded with saying that she could not die in peace until she had sent him her forgiveness and her blessing  bv degrees her strength declined and she could no longer leave the cottage she could only totter to the window where propped up in her chair it was her enjoyment to sit all day and look out upon the landscape still she uttered no complaint nor imparted to any one the malady that was preying cn her heart she never even mentioned her lovers name  but would lay her head on her mothers bosom and weep in silence her poor parents hung in mute anxiety over this fading blossom of their hopes still flattering themselves that it might again revive to freshness and that the bright unearthly bloom which sometimes flushed her cheek might be the promise of returning health  in this way she was seated between them one sunday afternoon her hands were clasped in theirs the lattice was thrown open and the soft air that stole in brought with it the fragrance ofthe clustering honeysuckle which her own hands had trained round the window  her father had just been reading a chapter in the bible it spoke of the vanity of worldly things and of the joys of heaven  it seemed to have diffused comfort and serenity through her bosom her eye was fixed on the distant village church  the bell had tolled for the evening service  the last villager was lagging into the

crayon gent ebiefo of j2efo 33ooi svo pp 354 london 1820 the author of tiie  sketch book had no need to deprecate the censure of the critics or to solicit from them  that courtesy and candour which a stranger has some right to claim who presents himself at the threshold of a hospitable mansion since the consciousness of his own talents and the approbation his work met with while publishing in numbers in america must have made him confident of ensuring public approbation among the seventeen sketches of which this work consists there is one on  english writers on america in which the author complains ofthe illiberality with which we treat american literature and which he attributes to the following causes  it has also been the peculiar lot of our country to be visited by the worst kind of english travellers while men of philosophical spirit and cultivated minds have been envoys from england to ransack the poles to penetrate the deserts anl to study the manners and customs of barbarous nations with which she can have no permanent intercourse of profit or pleasure it has been left to the broken down tradesman the scheming adventurer the wandering mechanic the manchester and birmingham agent to be her oracles respecting america from such sources she is content to receive her information respecting a country in a singular state of mora and physical development a country in which one of the greatest political experiments in the history of the world is now performing and which presents the most profound and niomentotis studies to the statesman and the philosopher aw   meu should give prejudiced accounts of america is not a matter of surprise the themes it oilers for conflation are too vast and elevated for their capacities the kjpieter is yet in a state of fermentation

diffused blessings je author assures us that the general impression in england that the people of the united states are inimical to the parent state is so far from being true that collectively speaking the prepossessions of the people are strongly in favour of england  indeed at one time they amounted in many parts of the union to an absurd decree of bigotry the bare name of englishman was a passport to the confidence and hospitality of every family and too often gave a transient currency to the worthless and the ungrateful throughout the country there was something of enthusiasm connected with the idea of england we looked to it w ith a hallowed feeling of tenderness and veneration as the land of our forefathersthe august repository of the monuments and antiquities of our racethe birthplace and mausoleum of the sages and heroes of our paternal history after our own country there was none in whose glory we more delightednore whose good opinion we were more anxious to possessnone towards which our hearts yearned with such throbbings of warm consanguinity even furing the late war whenever there was the least opportunity for kind feelings to spring forth it was the delight of the generous spirits of our country to show that in the midst of hostilities they still kept alive the sparks of future friendship  is all this to be at an end  is this golden band of kindred sympathies so rare between nations to be broken for ever perhaps it is for the bestit may dispel an illusion which might have kept us in mental vassalage interfered occasionally with our true interests and prevented the growth of proper national pride but it is hard to give up the kindred tie and there are feelings dearer than interestcloser to the heart than pridethat will still make us cast back a look of regret as we wander farther and farther from the paternal roof and lament the waywardness of the parent that would repel the affections of the child whatever the americans may be generally our author is certainly above those prejudices and is very anxious that the conduct he attributes to england in this respect should not be imitated bv his country men whom he warns in language so energetic and so highly honourable to his liberality that we cannot omit the passage  1 but above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings so far as to shut our eyes to the perception ot wbat is really excellent and amiable in the english character we are a young people necessarily an imitative one and must take our examples and models in a great degree from the existing nations of europe there is no country more worthy of our study than england the spirit of her constitution is most analogous to ours the manners of her people their intellectual activitytheir freedom of opiniontheir habits of thinking on thoe subjects which concern the dearest interests and mot sacred charities of private life are all congenial to the american character and in fact are all intrinsically excellent for it is in the moral feeling of the people that the deep foundations of british prosperity are laid and however the superstructure may be timeworn or overrun by abuses there must be something solid in the basis admirable in thc materials and stable in the structure of aa edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the tempest of the world rut notwithstanding all that our author bas said and ably as he has pleaded thc cause of his countrymen we agree with a eotemporary in thinking that there are two american authors only whose genius lias reason to complain of british neglect and with a very great deal of reason both unquestionably may do so namely charles brockden brown and washington irvin mr brown who has been dead many years was a novel writer of considerable talents who has not been inaptly compared to godwin he was the author of wieland9  ormond  arthur mervyn and  edgar huntly works very popular on the other side of the atlantic and admired by all who have read them in england washington irving is the sole author of the sketch book a periodical work published at new  ork and from which the present volume has been formed under his immediate direction an earlier production of his which attracted much attention in thc united states but is scarcely known in europe was c a history of new york by diedrick knickerbocker a work which although of a local nature displays so much true genius that we hope our arcadian friend mr miller will follow up his publication of the sketch book by a reprint of this singular production of the same author the sketch book consists of powerful delineations of the incidents which more particularly attracted the notice of the author in a voyage to europe many of them have an immediate reference to england with the customs and peculiarities of which he seems most intimately acquainted the first sketch is the  voyage in which the author most powerfully portrays the feelings by which he was actuated at different periods from quitting his native shores until he stepped upon the land of his forefathers but felt that he was a stranger in that land the following extract from this sketch

the present extracting from any more of his sketches in order to wive one of them entire lt is an affective narrative and founded on truth the subject has been noticed in a former number of this work in our review of the 4 life of curran the sketch is entitled the broken heart ik 1 never heard of any true ailed ion but twas nipped with care that like the caterpillar eats the leaves of the springs sweetest book the rose middleton  it is a common practice with those who have outlived the susceptibility of early feeling or have been brought up in the gay heartlessness of dissipated life to laugh at ail love stories and to treat the tales of romantic passion as mere fictions of novelists and poets my observations on human nature have induced me to think otherwise they have convinced me that however the surface of the character may be chilled and frozen by the cares of the world or cultivated into mere smiles by the arts of society still there are dormant fires lurking in the depths of the coldest bosom which when once enkindled become impetuous and are sometimes desolating in their effects indeed 1 am a true believer in the blind deity and go to the full extent of his doctrines shall i confess iti believe in broken hearts and the possibility of dying of disappointed love  i clo not however consider it a malady often fatal to my own sex  hut i firmly believe that it withers down many a lovely woman into an early grave 4 man is the creature of interest and ambition his nature leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world love is but the embellishment of his early life or a song piped in the intervals of the acts he seeks for fame for fortune for space in the worlds thought and dominion over his fellow men but a womans whol  life is a history ot the affections the heart is her woiid  it is tiiere her ambition strives for empire  it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures she sends forth her sympathies on adventure she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection  and it shipwrecked her case is hopelessfor it is a bankruptcy ot the heart  to a man the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs  it wounds some feelings of tendernessit blasts some prospects of felicity  but he is an active beinghe can dissipate his thoughts in the whirl of varied occupation or plunge into the tide of pleasure  or if the scene ot disappointment be too full of painful associations he can shiit ln abode at will and taking as it were the wings of the morning can fly to the uttermost parts of the earth and be at rest  but womans is comparatisely a fixed a secluded and a meditative life she is more the companion of her u thoughts and feelings  and if they are turned to minister  sorrow where shall she look for consolation her lot   be wooed and won  and if unhappy in her love her mar i like some fortress that has been captured and sacked ai abandoned aud left desolate   how many bright eyes grow dimhow many  cheeks grow palehow many lovely forms a a j into the tomb and none can tell the cae that bug  their loveliness as tiie dove will clap its wing to side and cover and conceal the arrow that i prc jts vitals so it is the nature of woman to hide from the world the pangs of wounded affection the love of delicate female is always shy and ilnt even when fortunate she scarcely breathes it to herself but when otherwise she buries it in the recesses of her bosom and there lets it cower and brood anions the ruins of her peace with her the desire of the heart has failed the great charm of existence is at an end she neglects all the cheerful exercises which gladden the spirits quicken the pulses and send the tide of life in healthful currents through the veins lier rest is brokenthe sweet refreshment of sleep is poisoned by melancholy dreamsdry sorrow drinks her blood5 until her enfeebled frame sinks under the bligiitest external injury j look for her after a little while and you lind friendship weeping over her untimely grave and wondering that one who but lately glowed with all the radiance of health and beauty should so speedily be brought down to  darkness and the worm you will be told of some wintery chill some casual indisposition that laid her low but no one knows ihe mental malady that previously sapped her strength and made her so easy a prey to the spoiler  she is like some tender tree the pride and beauty of the grove graceful in its form bright in its foliage but with the worm preying at its heart we find it suddenly withering when it should be most fresh and luxuriant we see it drooping its branches to the earth and shedding leaf by leaf uqtil wasted and perished away it falls even in the stillness of the forest and as we muse over the beautiful ruin we strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt that could have smitten it with decay 9 i have seen many instances of women running to waste and self neglect and disappearing gradually from the earth almost as if they had been exhaled to heaven  and have repeatedly fancied that i could trace their deaths through the various declensions of consumption cold debility languor melancholy until i reached the first symptom of dis j appointed love but an instance of the kind wa lately told to nie  the circumstances are well known in the country where they happened and 1 shall but give them in the manner in which they were related 1 every one must recollect the tragical story of young e the irish patriot it was too touching to be soon forgotten during the troubles in ireland he was tried condemned and executed on a charge of treason his fate made a deep impression on public sympathy he was so youngso intelligentso generousso braveso everything that we are apt to like in a young man his conduct under trial too was so lofty and intrepid the noble indignation with which he repelled the charge of treason against his countrythe eloquent vindication of his nameand his pathetic appeal to posterity in the hopeless hour of condemnationall these entered deeply into every generous bosom and even his enemies lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution  but there was one heart whose anguish it would be impossible to describe in happier days and fairer fortunes he jjad won the affections of a beautiful and interesting girl the ughter of a late celebrated irish barrister she loved him  jvth the disinterested fervour of a womans first and early  ve when every worldly maxim arrayed itself against hinf nen blasted in fortune and disgrace and danger darkened round his name

melancholy circumstances that endear the parting scenenothing to melt sorrow into those blessed tears sent like the dews of heaven to revive the heart in the parching hour of anguish  to revir her widowed situation more desolate she had incurred her fathers displeasure by her unfortunate attachment and was an exile from the paternal roof but could the sympathy ana kind offices of friends have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horror she would have experienced no want of consolation for the irish are a people of quick and generous sensibilities the most delicate and cherhdiing attentions were paid her by families of wealth and distinction she was led into society and they tried by all kinds of occupation and amusement to dissipate lier grief and wean her from the tragical story of her love but it was all in vain there are some strokes of calamity that scathe and scorch the soulthat penetrate to the vital seat of happinessand blast it never again to put forth bud or blossom siie never objected to frequent the haunts of pleasure but she was as much alone there as in the depths of solitude she walked about in a sad reverie apparently unconscious of the world around her she carried with her an inward woe that mocked at ali the blandishments of friendship and  heeded not the song of the charmer charm he never so wisely  the person who told me her story had seen her at a masquerade there can be no exhibition of fargone wretchedness more striking and painful than to meet it in such a scene to find it wandering like a spectre lonely and joyless where all around is gayto see it dressed out in the trappings of mirth and looking so wan and wobegone as if it had tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into a momentary forgetfulness of sorrow after strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd with an air of utter abstraction she sat herself down on the steps of an orchestra and looking about for some time with a vacant air that showed her insensibility to the garish scene she began with the capriciousness of a sickly heart to warble a little plaintive air she had an exquisite voice  but on this occasion it was so simple so touching it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness that she drew a crowd mute and silent around her and melted every one into tears  the story of one so true and tender could not but excite great interest in a country remarkable for enthusiasm it completely won the heart of a brave officer who paid his addresses to lier and thought that one so true to the dead could not but prove affectionate to the living she declined his attentions for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed by the memory of lier former lover he however persisted in his suit he solicited not her tenderness but her esteem he was assisted by her conviction of his worth and her sense of her own destitute and dependent situation for she was existing on the kindness of friends in a word he at length succeeded in gaining her hand though with the solemn assurance that her heart was unalterably anothers 4 isle took her with him to sicily hoping that a change of scene might wear out the remembrance ot early woes she was an amiable and exemplary wife and made an effort to be a happy one  but nothing could cure the silent and devouring melancholy thai had entered into her very soul she wafted away iii a slow but hopeless decline and at leugtli sunk into the grave tiie victim of a broken heart 4 it was on her that moore the distinguished irish poet composed the following lines  c she is fr from the land where lier

having like many other feeble christians compromised with my conscience by laying the sin of my own delinquency at another persons threshhold 1 occupied myself by making observations on my neighbours  1 was a yet a stranger in england and curious to notice the manners of its fashionable classes i found as usual that there was the least pretension where there was the most acknowledged title to respect i was particularly struck for intince with the family of a nobleman of high rank consisting oi several sons and daughters nothing could be more simple and unassuming than their appearance they generajly came to church in the plainest equipage and often on foot the young ladies would stop and converse in the kindest manner with the peasantry caress the children and lyten to the stories of the humble cottagers their countenances were open and beautifully fair with an expression of high refinement but at the same time a frank cheerfulness and an engaging affability their brothers were tall and elegantly formed tliev were dressed fashionably but simply with strict neatness and propriety but without any mannerism or foppishness their whole demeanour was easy and natural with that lofty grace and noble frankness which bespeak freediorn souls that have never been checked in their growth bv feelings of inferiority there is a healthfal hardiness about real dignity that never dreads contact and communion with others however humble it is only spurious pride that is morbid and sensitive and shrinks from every touch 1 was pleased to see the manner in which tiley would converse with the peasantry about those rural concerns and field sports in which the gentlemen of this country so much delight la these conversations there was neither haughtiness on the one part nor servility on the other and a on wane only reminded of the difference of rank by the habitual respect ci the peasant 4 in contrast to these was the family of a wealthy citizen who had amassed a vast fortune and having purchased the estate and mansion of a ruined nobleman in the neighbourhood was endeavouring to assume all the style and dignity of an hereditary lord oi the soil the family always

eye more proudly than common horses either because they had got a little of the family feeling or were reined up more tightly than ordinary  i could not but admire the style with which this splendid pageant was brought up to the gate of the churchyard there was a vast effect produced at the turning of an angle of the wall a great cracking of the whip  straining and scramblingof the horses glisteningof harness and flashing of wheels through gravel this was the moment of triumph and vain glory to the coachman the horses were urged and checked until they were fretted into a foam they threw out their feet in a prancing trot dashing about pebbles at every step the crowd of villagers sauntering quietly to church opened precipitately to the right and left gaping in vacant admiration on reaching the gate the horses were pulled up with a suddenness that produced an immediate stop and almost threw them on their haunches  there was an extraordinary hurry of the footmen to alight open the door pull down the steps and prepare every thin for the descent on earth of this august family the old citizen first emerged his round red face from out the door looking about him with the pompous air of a man accustomed to rule on change and shake the stock market with a nod his consort a fine fleshy comfortable dame followed him there seemed i must confess but little pride in her composition she was the picture of broad honest vulgar enjoyment the world went well with her and she liked the world she had fine clothes a fine house a line carriage fine children every thing was fine about her it was nothing but driving about and visiting and feasting life was to her a perpetual revel it wras one long lord mayors day  two daughters succeeded to this goodly couple they certainly were handsome but had a supercilious air that chilled admiration and disposed the spectator to be critical they were ultrafashionables in dress and thougla no one could deny the richness of their decorations yet their appro priateness might be questioned amidst the simplicity of a country church they descended loftily from the carriage and moved up the line of peasantry with a step that seemed dainty of the soil it trod on they cast an excursive glance around that passed coldly over the burly laces of the peasantry until they met the eyes of the noblemans family when their countenances immediately brightened into smiles and they made the most profound and elegant courtesies whica were returned in a manner that showed they were but slight acquaintances  i must not forget the two sons of this aspiring citizen who came to church in a dashing curricle with outridii they were arrayed in the extremity of the mode with all that pedantry of dress which marks the man of questionable pretensions to style they kept entirely by themselves eyeng every one askance that came near them a if measuring h claims to respectability  yet they were without conversation except the exchange of an occasional cant phrase liey even moved artificially for their bodies in compliance wit the caprice of the day had been disciplined into the absence of all ease and freedom art had done every thing to accomplish them as men of fashion but nature had denied them ta nameless grace they were vulgarly shaped like nie j formed for the common purposes ot life and had that air o j supercilious assumption which is never seen in the true gefl tleman i have been rather minute in drawing the pictures otthes two families because i considered them specimens ot wiktf often to be met with in this

thinks to elevate itself by humiliating ns neighbour   asl have brought these families into contrast 1 niu  j tice their behaviour in church that of the noblemans family was quiet serious and attentive not that they appeared to have any fervour of devotion but rather a respect for sacred things and sacred places inseparable from good breeding the others on the contrary were in a perpetual flutter and whisper they betrayed a continual consciousness of finery and a sorry ambition of being the wonders of a rural congregation the old gentleman was the only one really attentive to the service he took the whole burden of family devotion upon himself standing bolt upright and uttering the responses with 3 loud voice that might be heard all over the church it was evident that he was one of those thorough church and  king men who connect the idea of devotion and loyalty who consider the deity some how or other of the government party and religion a very excellent sort of thing that ought to be countenanced and kept up  when hejoined so loudly in the service it seemed more by way of example to the lower orders to show them that though so great and wealthy he was not above beingreligious as 1 have seen a turtlefed alderman swallow publicly a basin of chanty soup smacking his lips at every mouthful and pronouncing it  excellent food for the poor  when the service was at an end i was curious to witness the several exits of my groups the young noblemen and their sisters as the day was fine preferred strolling home across the fields chatting with the country people as they went the others departed as they camein grand parade again were the equipages wheeled up to the gate there was again the smacking of whips the clattering of hoofs and the glittering of harness the horses started off almost at a bound the villagers again hurried to right and left the wheels threw up a cloud of dust and the aspiring family was wrapped out of sight in a whirlwind to be

highest most complete and most commanding work because in a memorable passage she set her sail to a natural wind moral passion swept through the world of that bookdirect grief emotion close to the fact of life love indignation remorse dishonour and honour all the storms of breasts complex civilised but incorrupt in  the house of mirth  we have to read of the fortunes of a woman full of desires and of selflove but void of virtue of passion and of intellect and round about her are only lovers of their own ease and supremacy claimants to the right of a social contemptuousness towards other less fortunate egotists as the salt of life and graspers of riches as its sweetness to observe this horde without obvious irritation is a work demanding selfcontrol and mirs wharton watches them from the sequestered bower of her fine art taking wide views keeping her own counsel it seems strange to say of a novelist who has filled five hundred pares with chosen words that she keeps her own counsel but it is none the less obviously true of the writer of these five hundred remarkable pages the keeping of her own counsel is one of the feats of her work is it indeed worth doing so well or rather is not the other featthat of the unlocking of a noble mindworth doing in much of her writing we were admitted to recognise her noble mind we are reluctant to forego an intimacy that we valued and when mirs wharton goes about to keep her own counsel she does it as she does everything extraordinarily well thackeray intended to keep his owvn counsel as a sentimentalist but he did not do it well he assigned the sentiment to certain charactersto women to laura pendennis foremostand pretended to be a moderately cynical man looking on with a smile he took for himself as it were the part of arthur pendennis whereas he was laura at heart and thus easily persuaded the duller readers in their multitude during two generations that he was of a cynical turn but the author of  the house of mirth  does not reveal herself even dramatically she is the greatest thing that a writer of fiction can bea moralist but there is no person in this story to bear the charge of the character and in this extremity of reserve lurks the one fault of art in the bookthat is the indefiniteness of the  better part  which seldom has to offer to the selfloving and moneyloving heroine in the character of this young new york woman about whom the whole history is written we recognise two likenesses she is partly gwendolen harleth and partly hedda gabler vet with something modern in the place of gwendolens thirst after righteousness and something intelligible in the place of heddas vice and heddas despair both resemblances therefore are slight now in her slight likeness to gwendolen harleth she should have a kind of external conscience in the form of a mana man at least esteemed at least admirable but the man in whom the role is just suggested in  the house of mirth is very little estimable he has born a part in

part he shows the heroine halfheartedly as a way out of her pursuit of luxury is vague if it wvere definite we are sure it would be inadequate and smrs wvharton ably leaves it in a little cloud we choose however to pause where she passes and to ask a closer question all the answer we get is a tender of liberty and obviously liberty is what the unfortunate egoist the woman of the new york  world  needs urgently and all but desperatelv but in what liberty does the apostle of this vague apostclate himself abide we see him in the beloved luxury in which all the persons of the book roll themselves with revolting joy we cannot imagine lawrence seldom following liberty into a hard or a useful or a wild or a sacramental life ihe sets open or rather ajar to the woman who inclines to love

in new york and the various degrees of its smartness form the principal theme of the book but it is particularly concerned with the fortunes of a beautiful girl suffering from want of dollars the malady mo9t difficult to cure in such a milieu the girl is more attractive than her surroundings good work is shown in her characterization and in her external circumstances and there is more in the picture of the mixed condition of her emotions and morals her unfortunate upbringing has given her small chance of rising above a circle where luxury and pleasure dominate yet there are in her

finelytempered highspirited highsouled girl whose life is wrecked through a single failing there is no plotno attempt at plot the thing which stands out is the authors sympathetic delineation of her

B8169,['8519142'],  heathcote of gangoil harry harry hcathcotc of gangoil a tale of australian bush lift by anthony trollope low and co this novel of mr trollopes possesses the double merit of being short and extremely interesting but ws should think lbe would have encountered some difficulty if he had tried to get it published under the auspices of an emigration agency it professes to give a faithful picture of the society of the queensland  bush and of the struggle for existence among the various members of that society which although limited is still sufficiently   ci a naynniqt1ie interests the five drin large to contain antagonistic interests the five principal elements that take an active part in mr trollopes story are squatters freeselectors hired workmen thieves and mosquitos of these the mosquitos are the only animated creatures that seem thoroughly to enjoy life next to them come the thieves whose policy it seems to be to squat on a small leasehold property and to make that a basis of operations for stealing the sheep and cattle of their neighbours the danger of detection and imprisonment or hanging is a certain drawback to the charms of this easy life but that is so slight in a thinly peopled country that the squatter whose notions of property are primitive and elementary as those of paleys pigeon might be ideally happy but for his rivals the mosquitos when however we ascend in the scale of queensland society we have a painful illustration of the cares of greatness and of the advantages for happiness possessed by those at the bottom of the ladder as mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,orthamerica

B7324,['6853911'],  the myths of the north american indians redskin tales by louis spence frai illustrated george g harrap and co 7s 6d net a collection of stories told by north american indians is here presented mr spence does not inform us how he became possessed of them but one is inclined to think that they have been gathered by him from the books which appear in the bibliography at the end of the present volume these sources differ very much in their value as evidence s e they range from the uncritical histories and travels of writers like adair and the bartrams in the eighteenth century through the interminable works of bancroft and catlin in the next down to the modern and more scientific collections of brinton curtin and boas and the acta of the smithsonian institute and of the many transatlantic anthropological societies the tales are here brought together without references to their origin or mode of selection save that they are arranged under the names of the various tribes or nations such as algonquins iroquois sioux and pawnees the stories thus chosen do not give us a very high idea of the red indian imagination hardly any of them are myths in the sense in which max muller used the word although in the case of hiawatha to which mr spence devotes a page or two he follows mr horatio hale in declaring that the whole story has grown up by disease of language round the history ot a real chief whose name happened to signify  he who seeks the wampum belt most of them are totem tales plainly invented ex post facto to explain why different tribes families or individuals came to be called by the names of animals a very few rise a little above this level as in the socalled cherokee tale of the origin of medicine where the animals once the friends of mankind grow angry at being hunted for food and call down diverse diseases on man who is only saved by the plants overhearing the plot and agreeing that each of them shall furnish a remedy for one of the diseases named the great majority however are merely wondertales in which magic power is ascribed to man and the lower animals alike and which mainly differ from the fairytales of our infancy by their pointlessness and incoherence a fair instance of this is the iroquois story of the stone giantess who settled herself in the wigwam of a hunter so as to escape from her cruel husband after a time the stone giant came in search of her when the hunter by her instructions struck him first on the arms and then on the nape of the neck killing him when the time comes for the hunter to return to his village the stone giantess also returns to her own people with the remark that now she has nothing to fear one would feel greater interest in these stories if one could be convinced of their originality so far is this from being the case that many of them seem to owe a good deal to wellknown european asiatic or african sources the sioux story of the beloved son who cannot return from the submarine land of the shades because he has eaten of food there is too strongly reminiscent of persephone and the pomegranate seed for the change of sex and locality to throw us off the scent so too in another sioux tale the exalting of the rabbit into an animal of extreme intelligence and cunning seems to smack of the negro stories enshrined in uncle remus and another attributed to the same tribe of a horse who warns his master of his brotherinlaws plot against his life is quite as near to the egyptian tale of two brothers as that of joseph and potiphars wife which most biblical critics now assign to that source the swanmaidens whose feather dresses are stolen by the hero are found here as in the norse literature and the arabian nights as is the lohengrin legend of the magic bark drawn by swans some of these parallels seem to have struck mr spence himself as when he draws the readers attention to the harrying of hades read harrowing of hell and declares that the algonquin tale of the crowwoman and the wolf bears a striking resemblance to spensers una and the lion if the tales given in this book have any connecting or distinctive thread it is the belief which appears in most of them in a land above the sky inhabited by spirits or supernatural beings resembling men who take an interest not always benevolent in the affairs of their mortal counterparts here again one would like to know if there is any trace of such a belief existing before the visit of the christian missionaries mr spences book is prettily illustrated by coloured plates of considerable artistic merit and is equipped with an introduction in which he deals with the origin of the north american indians he is we fancy right in implying that man is not indigenous to the american continent but came there from asia by a landbridge now submerged his identification of the modern esquimaux first with the earliest inhabitants and then with the skraelings of the norse sagas is more open to question but may pass muster we can hardly agree with him however when he tells us ex cathedra and without authority quoted that the fetish is in short a mascota luckbringer and that the mythologies of the red man are infinitely more rich in creative read creation and deluge myths than those of any other race in the two hemispheres we wonder whether he has ever heard of the sumerian cosmogonies whence perhaps all later ones have sprung,orthamerica

B1927,['8720962'],  th red rorer  tab  ttlk rkl kovkk bv the ai thou of  tin spy  the pilot  thc prairie c e s vols limo london lm2s avk must admit that in the present production of mr cooper we have been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the importance of possessing so interesting a legend to communicate   and such is also the name they give to his vessel because no mau who has put foot on board her has over come bael to say that she has

both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest

in the manner and the very things 1 have named to you more than that ho took good note of the vessel that he might know her if chance or providence should over happen to throw her again into his way she was a long black ship lying low in the water like a snake in the grass with a desperate wicked look and altogether of dishonest dimensions then every body says that she appears to sail faster than the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy upon the motions of the ked rover who with a facility only to he met with in romance becomes acquainted with our hero anti is at once appointed to the first lieutenancy of the pirateship the descriptive portions of the work are without exception good and we quote the following picture of the cabin of the lied rover   the apartment in which our adventurer now found himself atrbrded no bad illustration of the character of its occupant in its form and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements  but in ils furniture anti equipments it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation the lamp which swung from the upper deck was of solid silver and though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity there was that in its shape and ornaments which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character massive candlesticks of the same precious metal and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation were on a venerable tible whose mahogany was glittering with the polish ol hail a century and whose gilded claws anti carved supporters bespoke au original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship a conch covered with cut velvet stood along the transom  while a divan of blue silk lay against the bulkhead oppoite inanifesin by its fashion its materials and its piles of pillows that even asia had been made to contribute to tue ease of its luxurious owner in addition to these prominent articles there were cut glass mirrors plate and even hangings each of which by something peculiar in il fashion or materials bespoke au origin iliiterent 1roai that of ils neighbour in short splendour and elegance seemed to have been mach more consulted than propriety or conformity in taste in the selection ol most of those articles which had been oddly enough made to contribute to the caprice or to cue comfort of their siiguia possessor  lu the midst of this medley of wealth rntl luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt is all in vain however the ship is on the point of sailing when most opportunely the captain breaks his leg and wilder is without loss of time nay on a live minutes intid uiatiou ol the tact installed in thu command the royal caroline so she is named sails from the bay whilst all the exertions of the new captain are employed to carry her out of the course of the rover isle fails of course  the pirate pursues him  a storm ensues the royal caroline is dismantled reduced to a total wreck and at length roes down while wilder and the ladies escape in the launch and are safely received on board

made a plunge like a dyirp whale  and raising its stern high into the air glided into the depths of thc sea like the leviathan seeking his secret places the motionless boat was lilted with the ship

through the same gaping whirlpool to the bottom then it rose rocking to the surface  and for a moment was tossed am whirled like a bubble circling in the eddies of a poul after which the ocean moaned and slept again  the moonbeams playing across its treacherous bosom sweetly and calm as the rays are seen to ipi iver on a lake that is embedded in sheltering mountains the plot now thickens  the rover encounters the british vessel to which wilder is attached goes on board in disguiseand discovers his treachery hut instead however of executing him as a traitor he dismisses him and his friends in the most polite and approved manner as soon as wilder gets on board he informs his commander of the real character of the rover a seafight ensues the british are beaten and the treacherous

disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by heury kings ley 3 vols macmillan and co mr henry kingsley follows with much vigour his brothers lead and iu the school of muscular christianity which his brother has founded he may prove better claim upon the rank of a head master than that of founders kin the author of geoffrey hamlyn not only talks about life in australis but knows it and as this field of exertion occupies a large place in the ethical system he is helping to develope bia australian experience is worth a doctorate to the new teacher there are four stalwart lovers of a wayward heroine who marries unwisely and at last finds herself an orphan with an infant at the breast her husband a transported coiner he was transported by the judge to a place where he became captain of a gang of bushrangers killed his own son snd wss hung most of the other persons of ths story are transported also by the author to australia there it may be that the compactness of the plot suffers a little from the full and fresh impression of the

good grass again we ought to start and get some store cattle mr henry kingsley hints sn intention to write more the public will be glad to read more for his power evidently is not of a kind to be exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the artificial precincts of three volumes post 8vo no matter who or what the interlocutors may be mr henry kingsley however has written a book which the public will be more inclined to read than to criticize and we commend them to each other,orthamerica
B2732,"['3172146', '6766123']",  little stories abou  women these  little stories of very distinguished workmanship are mainly concerned with the life of english society womennot seen on parade but in the moods of remniscence and sentiment that come when they are tired or suddenly released from tensionand wih popular italian luttle stories about women by george fleming 3s 6i grant richards life of which the writer has an unusually close knowledge the italian stories with their pithy use of the speech of peasant and gondolier give the keenest literary pleasure but the english ones will certainly make a more general appeal while in them george flemings gift of light and certain portraiture is perhaps seen at its beat in  by accident for instance we are presented to the heroine as she is passing out of life hardly a fact is told of the years that went before but we know her this irreproachable wife and mother and member of society bound nevertheless by the slightest of bonds to her responsibilitiesthe halfconscious irony in her relations to life always a puzzle to her solemn husband yet in whom sentiment could be and had been awakened in whom it assertn itself as the strongest reality at the last on a lower scale of difficulty not of skill are the two portraits in a woman with no nonsense about her of the illmated friends one accepting the worlds good things with impudent complacency the other on whom life levies heavy dues because she lacks the great gifts audacity and grace in  for better for worse and in  mees the latter a study of italian patriotism as seen through the ignorant but loving eyes of an english ladysmaidthere is the same lighthanded skill but i miss it in the more openly emotional  the next house  and  a contemporary of the italian stories  the prince of morocco craves first mention for its dating subject and its unexpectedness it is an imaginative guess at the history of portias swarthy suitor of that name george fleming accounts for him in northern italy in a poetical fantastical experiment which is only audacious not blasphemous of course for most excellent reasons it ought to be a failure but in one or two directions it confounds the rightminded critic for it revivifies a page of old venetian life and it is a delightful bit of imaginative writing in force and reality however it must give way before the exquisite tragicomedy of the beggar women in  for ten francs one of the two great successes of the book perhaps at venice cannot compete with that one in familiar human interest yet i venture to think the highwater mark of the book is reached in the narrative of the old gondolier once employed in his youth by an austrian officer to row two prisoners to their death at the back of san georgio in most hands it would have been a mere picturesque description here it is a little drama concentrating into its few pages the venetian struggle gathering up the profound mystery of the venetian night giving too by the way the gondolier philosophers excellent summary for and against the powers that were and the powers that be  men walked the streets of venice with the cold fear of the white prisons and the hot fear of the white army lying heavy upon their mouths so that no man spoke of it at allno not even to his brother and when there was talk that man vanished   now we are all italians they tell me   we are all alike now 1 and maso and you and the first threefoothigh assassin of a sard   that is because we have a governmer t nowa government and an army and a law and a1l italy is free and the black dogs of priests can frighten no one any more except the women and the wine is wvatered and a mans polenta costs like roast chicken   we are free sari how should i know  but what i say is that those with the full pockets get the last word those were our masters and these are our masters paroni i e poi paroni and the master is the man who has the last word surely one may expect a mmasure of popularity for stories whose subtle art is condoned by the general human interest of their tubjects a m  little stories aboun women by georwo fleming grant richards it is from a dingy palette that these impressions are spread they are keyed don to the patience of the most morose pessimism but they are truth that side of it and life at its most lamentable in the career of human beings there arrives a moment when the soul comes to the surface and the careful watcher may discern in the meagre spectre the never realised notion after which its creator fashioned it george fleming is this careful watcher she knows how to qapture the moment she is cunning to unveil it her method reminds one more than a little of m marcel prevost i select a contemporary it is the reverie of a woman upon what had not passed six y ears before upon the day when by way of a final indulgence of an unlawful passion she had given her lover a fareweeu rendezvous that meeting never took place of  they had been prevented by the commonest the most obvious of accidents it had simply rained all day long she had so vehemently persuaded herself that the very completeness of the sacrificethe manner in which she sent him away for evercould propitiate fate cheat justice turn this last poor selfindulgence into a mere question of compensation for the pain they suffered and then it had rained all day we look into the womans mind while the fictitious details of that sterile day stream through it just as by a more familiar device for securing the perspective of which mr harland writes as so effective an element in the successful treatment of the short story we have been shown the intimate leaves of the carnst or of familiar correspondence she arrives at the station for stonehenge so runs the story which she tells herself for the hundredth time and finds him awaiting her in the lumbering hired carriage he was by her side  his love was there  and in an instant a feeling of absolute satisfaction the rest the contentment of a natural completion filled all her heart and being stilled it filled it rising rising like water in a lock that trick by the way of doubling a word either to give a sustained effect or for intensity is throughout the volume overindulged they send the carriage away and lunch  and then    she told him the whole story rapidly impetuously without stopping to pick words as if some secret barrier between their minds were for the first time broken  i was twentytwo nearly twentythree and there were so many of us at home i was so pleased not to wait to be the first of all to marry  i liked all the things he gave me roger nownowat the present momenti like having those things still  but this was not all that held her when she was most nearly softened recurred the knowledge that   sometime somewhere there would come a certain day a certain hour when he ceased sic to care for her as he cared now  and nothing could prevent itnothing it was not even his fault  as they neared the terminus he made a laqt appeal and as he knelt   she laid her other hand upon his bowed head what was there left to say  she loved this man with all the force of which she was capable but she had grown up in a society which discourages sentiment and holds many material satisfactions for those who are successful after its own fashion her husband fusses in upon the finish of the vision the impression is of a little nature fenced into the strait path of social sanction by no principle of religion or of ethics but by its essential defects of courage and confidence subject therefore to every temptation empty of all satisfactiona strong and clear impression caught at the moment when the woman knew herself of the eleven other storiesand none of them falls below a high standard a woman

B2596,['9458182'],  macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,orthamerica

corrudtion of the den thrums from photo by valentine and sons dundee the wooded ravine called the den is in thrums rather on its western edge but it is so craftily hidden away that when within a stones throw you may give up the search for it it is ao so deep that larks rise from the bottom anl carol overhead thinking themselves high in the heavens before they are on a level with nether drumleys farmland in shape it is almost a semicircle but its size depends on you and the maid sentimental tommy political life is rather more doubtful after we have met senator north and the stability of the republic is not quite so certain as we had taken for granted hamiltons ghost must rouse a new train of thought in many minds perhaps mrs ahertons compatriots have forgiven her by this time for her outspoken condemnation of the war with spain but she has to count with readers on this side for she lashes a very common sentiment of the day when she laughs at the idea of wvar any kind of war being justifiable for the sake of the health of the aggressive nation but of course it is the lovestory that will attract most and rightly too for in spite of the washingtonian setting and the talk of votes and debates and wvar it is not a very political novel after all the heroine is quite specially unpolitical though she haunts the ladies gallery and keeps a political salon she took to politics as many take to philanthropy or embroidery because she wzanted an interest from the first moment of her purpose she flatters and pets politicians who like flattery and petting of course and pay her back in kind she sticks to her new interest because she falls in love with a senator her lovestory is not very romantic or very heroic or very charming it is all too much arranged it follows too closely the lines of her selfinterest she wears innumerable beautiful toilettes but otherwise betty is a decidedly commonplace young person like too many of mrs athertons heroines she would be of no use at all for purposes of romance if she were not very rich but senator north makes an impressive hero for all his sixty years the only fault we have to find with him is his too elderly manner the tones of the benevolent grandfather are a little too audible but when he sinks these we own him to be a courtly and a fascinating loveroriginal too for his manner of keeping faith with his living invalid wife while calculating future chances of marriage with betty rouses our interest even our admiration the vitality of the man is astounding while combatting almost alone the war passions of a nation he has the spare force to be a lover and when the girl apparently deserts him lest her feeling for him should carry ler to unconventional lengthsfor a much younger man this gallant of sixty never doubts of his power but rests quiet till she comes back again he is a bold invention senator north and boldness has bred success it would have been better that the secondary story of jack emery and harriet had been omitted no european reader can quite realise save irntellectually and reason has nothing to do with the matter the inevitability of their tragedy if mrs atherton had spent the force of a whole story on them it might have been more satisfactory perhaps one day she still devote a book to that tragedy of  colour  notes on novels these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow senator north by gertrude atherton mrs atherton has here brought her wit and observation to the study of american political life and of politics in relation to society says mrs madison to her daughter who is determined to go in for politics it always has been my boast betty that i never have had a politician in my house bettys unshaken resolve throws mrs madison into tears of despair as she forsees her drawingroom filled with a lot of lank rawboned yankees with political beards the story deals with the cares and temptations of senatorial life and is laid in washington and often in the senate betty went to the senate gallery on the following day    and heard an exposition of the populist religion by the benevolentlooking bore from

kentucky of 1795 with many characteristic touches of life and manners the actors too in his quiet drama are not wanting in interest kitty the wayward in view of her rejected lovers later career we had almost added the wisethe blacksmith and the parson are no less attractive though lightly sketched than the fuller study of the cultivated and hardworking gentlewoman mrs falconer john gray the hero of the story is good too with his gift of high seriousness and his rejection by kitty is very proper and satisfactory but his later failure to secure his real love by waiting seems unnatural and inconsistent with his steady uncompromising character most of the writing is excellent and full of effective touches if anything mr allon is a little too fond of the grand style which however he manages very well there is a delicate literary flavour about many of his images  sometimes they seem too directly reminiscent as when he says it is the woman who bursts the whole grape of sorrow against the irrepressible palate to  flirt a person  sounds a little odd to an english ear and suggests though idiom of the old lady who could not go to church because  there was a party as sneered her boots  the choir invisible by james lane allen 6s macmillhu it is possible that mr line allens popularity may not be so wide in england as it has grown to be in his own country but the excellence of his work must secure him many readers among us though our popular taste of the more cultivated kind is very different from popular taste in america here we are just a little ashamed or a little impatient of the open display of earnest feeling in a novel we like it involved in the characters implied in the course of events there are no such superior airs put on by cultivated american readers who are more patient of sentiment of explanation of the disburdening of the heart in  the choir invisible mr allen disburdens himself with great simplicity revealing a very sympathetic and sensitive nature lovers of historical fiction will find local colour and reference studiously and artistically attended to in this story of revolutionary america the scene of which is laid in kentucky at the end of the last century but the main interest is not the revival of old times but a lovestory which might be of today or any day a story which reminds one very pleasantly of harry esmond and lady castlewoad and not merely because the heroine of the choir invisible is a virginian we are reminded too of oliver wendell holmes by the temper of the reflections and the fact that we recall worthy

style pellucid and picturesque a vivid and disciplined power of characterization and an intimate knowledge of a striking epoch and an alluring country he transports us to kentucky in the year 1795 the plot is not novel mr allen lays bare no sore he develops no problem it is just the story of a man who loved an attractive woman who was unworthy intertwined with the history of another who was pure gold that is all but so magical is the wilderness environment so fresh the characters so buoyant the life they lead so companionable so well balanced and so touched with humanity the authors personality that i hereby send him greeting and thanks for a brave book mr allen is not so well known in this country as in the united states but the choir invisibls will remedy that he has already written several novels including summer in arcady and a kentucky cardinal i have not read either of those booksin fact here is a frank confession before i began upon the choir invisible i had not read one line of mr allens writings and knew him only through appreciations in the american press but it is clear he is a man who has worked long and diligently at his art and that while he was chastening and controlling a manner his matter was increasing in volume and quality what would he make of a modern story i wonder here he has as background a glorious and undiscovered country where the imagination is fired by mere descriptions of nature and by pen pictures of the looks and dress of pioneer men it is all so fresh so new so right so sane so different from the tired life that encompasses us does not this stir the imagination  on the outskirts of the town lay the wilderness undulating away for hundreds of miles like a vast green robe with scarce a rift of human making or

smoke of their pipes mingling with the grey of their jauntily worn raccoonskin caps the rifts of yellow sunlight blending with the yellow of their hunting shirts and tunics their knives and powderhorns fastened in the belts that girt in their gaunt waists the heroic youthful sinew of the old border folk one among them larger and handsomer than the others had pleased his fancy by donning more nearly the indian dress his breechclout was of dappled fawnskin his long thigh boots of thin deerhide were open at the hips leaving exposed the clear whiteness of his flesh below the knees they were ornamented by a scarlet fringe tipped with the hoofs of fawns and the spurs of the wild turkey and in his cap he wore intertwined wings of the hawk and the scarlet tanager or this description of the sidetracks through the primaeval forest  into this high road of the mastodon and the bison smaller pathways entered from each side as lesser watercourses run into a river the avenues of the roundhorned elk narrow yet broad enough for the tossing of his lordly antlers the track of the countless migrating shuffling bear the slender woodland alleys along which buck and doe and fawn had sought the springs or crept tenderly from their breeding coverts or fled like shadows in the race for life the devious wolfruns of the maddened packs as they had sprung to the kill the threadlike passages of the stealthy fox the tiny trickle of tie squirrel crubsing and recrossing without number and ever close beside all these unseen the graspath or the treepath of the cougar as i have said the plot of the story is of the slightest but apart altogether from its engaging setting the story is told extremely well and the objectivity of the characters will please the most fastidious amy falconer is a fascinating creation and the scene between her and john gray wherein this pretty minx does not explain why she cannot accompany him to theball is told with a delightful touch and in the vein of the finest comedy mr allen has a wide range and from passages of summerday philandering turns easily to such a vigorous chapter as that describing john grays fight with a cougar the dreaded panther of the backwoodsman which has for its kindred the royal tiger and the fatal leopard of the old world the episode is too long to quote in full but i must find room for the passage where the man first discovers the near the very near presence of the beast it is early dawn a fine drizzling rain has set in and in a mood of deep dejection he has wandered into the schoolhouse he sat at the upper

B582,"['8781385', '4696693']",  tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a

these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling

things which are absurd with a good deal that is clever in this volume we have seldom seen a work of more unequal merit there is a mixture of poetry and prose in the contents the prose is the best the poetry is poor in the extreme the merit of the work chiefly consists in the insight it gives into the foibles arid follies of the fashionable world the volume professes to be only the first of a

 and the most zealous desire for doing good v if we find the subject made agreeable and witty we must crave permission to doubt not the intention but the moral value of the work ffidendepths  professes to deal with the social evil but we fear takes much too onesided a view of the question for its cure we cannot deny that the work is well written and interesting  and sets the cure in a true light so far as seduction is concerned no one can regard this crime with too great horror the delicacy of the female sex once removed and it really seems as if nothing were left to it of that shrinking modesty or of that tender selfsacrificing affection so peculiar to women we hold with the writer of  hidden depths that no punishment can be too severe for the wilfui coldblooded seducer of innocence  bat then we require first to be satisfied of the innocence we cannot help feeling that very little account is made of the sin itself by the writer we are told with truth that the social evil is hardly held as a sin by the lower class supposing then that the offender held up to our execration in this novel instead of deserting his victim had pensioned her off before his marriage to another the novel could not have continued to choose what we hope is an extreme case for our inspection is not the best plan for preventing the fate of thousands of women which occurs from far more ordinary causes what are the statistics of seduction and of what the writer would connect with it suicide  take country villages as a test and a fair one in this case as the author describes his unfomunates as innocent country girls w have known an instance of a labourer wjfafe applied to his clergyman for help towwsib the maintenance of his illegitimate child alleging that it was the custom

his duty to marry her one such birth was not held sufficient cause again working in the fields is another fruitful source of contamination  the language and conduct of the married women being beyond measure vile we write it in sorrow  but the  innocent abodes of the poor with eight or ten persons of various ages sleeping in one bedroom do not yet exist vanity love of dress the desire of a life of excitement proved by female servants declining what they consider dull places the spread of light literature speaking slightingly of such connexions between rich and poorsuch as these are the real sources of the evil among such a class you will not find many who are goaded by excess of feeling or remorse to commit suicide the statistics of suicide prove that the most trifling causes such as sudden passion or illtemper will induce persons to destroy themselves what a terrible indifference to infanticide does the now celebrated case of the devonshire murderess discloseand by the way we have her photograph in hidden depths we now give a sketch of the story the heroine ernestine courtenay is engaged in the search for the sister of a girllois brook seduced by colonel courtenay her brother the girl lois brook commits suicide on being deserted and leaves a letter imploring the colonel to save her younger sister annie from a like melancholy end ernestine who is engaged to a mr lingard sets out with his permission on the search for annie brook who has been also seduced and cast off by her lover the tale shows us the social difficulties which meet ernestine in her mission she finds out the parents of the two girls  the father refuses to take back his child fearing the disgrace and loss of his place as lodgekeeper in a noblemans park  the mother gives a portrait of annie and a clue to the place where she is ernestine meets with a rebuff from lady carleton in asking permission for annies return to her fathers home she then goes to greyburgh university where her brother keginald is residing there she finds her brother dying and in a state of great mental trial from infidel views instilled into him by his college tutor two clergymen are introduced  the first is rector of the oarish in which annie brook is living a o dr granby is horrified at the notion of permitting a profligate to come near his house a good deal of wit is made out of his excuses for not seeking the lost he recommends ernestine to give up the search and to engage herself in real works of charity such as teaching an infant school  to clap their hands in unison or to imitate his daughter marie who leads c our little choir in term time when several of the collegians assist at our services and can appreciate our musical efforts we must here confess our surprise at any clergyman of a large parish represented as being so ludicrously indifferent to the cases of unfortunate girls of whose existence in visiting the poor he must continually be reminded and actually brought into contact with on their sick beds the other clergyman a mr thorold is represented as fully engaged in all the usual parish work of nightschools reformatories c as the book is published in scotlaud we hope that it is simply ignorance on the part of the author as to the conduct of the parish clergy who all more or less must meet with many cases connected with the social evil annie brook is at last found and persuaded to enter a reformatorythe discipline of which is too severe for her  she runs away but prefers rather to starve than to have recourse to the streets again she dies in the hospital but before her death recognises and forgives her first seducer lingard he of course is disclaimed for ever by ernestine who gives herself up to the work of recovering lost females we are treated to four deaths in the book three minutely described and the bodies properly laid out we find a great deal of poetical description as well as sentimental writing all the unfortunates are beautiful mis guided impulsive and affectionate we cannot think that the work although well written and interesting is quite in character with the very serious preface which informs us that the work is not one of fiction for  though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records much of the social evil is attributed teyoung men at the universityboys really of from sixteen to eighteen about whom the girls of the town congregate no doubt but innocent young women are not seduced out of the villages near as the author would indicate the language and turn of thought put into the mouths of the unfortunates are by no means true to nature as the author states in the work the sin itself is but lightly regarded among the poor they would therefore be very unlikely to speak or think even as here represented we cannot get over the feeling that the author more reprobates the desertion than the seduction of females the remarks about the overseverity of reformatories are good  but we cannot forget the overtenderness which lets loose ticketofleave men on the public the real fact is that if half the interest were displayed toward our poorest class before they become so interesting through sin and crime we should be fostering that sympathy between class and class which mr justice talfourd in his last charge declared to be so sadly wanting far more than by endeavouring to cure the evil after its spread the social evil will never be healed by novel writers however talented they may be the attack must not be made on human nature but on those evils which render that nature so weak and are thus the causes of the mischiefviz ignorance and the crowded dwellings of the poor and the poverty which makes them regard money as the sole good in life to be obtained at all hazards there are many landed proprietors even in mucliabtised dorset who are heartily working for the good of the poor by building cottages with more bedrooms the wages are also fixed at a higher rate by those gentlemen with the same objectthat of improving the moral condition of the labourers on their estates all this must be a work of time  and after all we cannot expect that the social evil can be ever eradicated until the whole world is in a far different state from what we now behold when there is no longer any more dishonesty or violence or deceit there will also be no more profligacy meanwhile if the efforts of philanthropists are directed not to exciting morbid sympathy towards the poor but to teaching men more selfrespect they will materially lessen the social evil  hidden depths tiim1 authoress of this very remarkable book writes with vehement earnestness taking for the motto of her work the axiom  verita4 ea major charitas  but we are sorry to say that her earnestness is in excess of her judgment and that what she takes for absolute truth is but a very limited part of a great and complex whole still though we are compelled for the truths sake to pass this apparently sweeping censure upon her work we are equally compelled to bear witness to the high intention with which she has laboured the extraordinary circumstance of a delicate pious and intellectuallygifted woman writingeven anonymouslyon the subject of the  social evil is in itself enough to bespeak respectful attention for her book but in addition the writer of  hidden depths is entitled to special consideration for the striking literary power she exhibits in the present volumes had she contented herself with writing an ordinary novel in which the sin of seduction was held up to the reprobation and scorn of all rightminded readers we are sure she would have deserved to be recognised as worthy of a conspicuous place in the ranks of contemporary english novelwriters she has chosen however to write with a purpose and we might almost say has courted failure for the admiration which hidden depths is well calculated to inspire so long as it is considered in the light of a work of fiction is turned to objection when the story with its narrow bounds and partial exhibition of facts has to be viewed as the exposition of a gigantic social disorderthe most saddening difficult not to say hopeless problem of civilised life 4 though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records in this sentence taken from the authoresss preface we detect the error which underlies the whole argument of her book what happens mostly in the case of those who act upon mere philanthropical impulse has happened in her case having become possessed of a few facts she has taken them as representing the whole truth of the subject on which they bear it is clearly to be inferred from her book that she believes seductionthat is to say the systematic ruin of perfectly innocent girls by heartless profligatesto be one of the chief causes of the vice in question but how utterly without foundation such a belief must be is known to every one who has ventured to inquire into the subject at all it is most probable that the writer of  hidden depths  has heard the story of the happy home the perfect innocence the advent of the betrayer the faill from virtue the abandonment and all the other incidents related by some reclaimed unfortunate the mistake she has made is in having given a too ready credence to a relation which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred is found upon searching inquiryr to be wholly or in great part untrue of the poor wretches who qualify themselves to take the distinctive title of unfortunates it is almost certain that not ten in a thousand adopt that miserable calling from the cause assigned by her we need not recapitulate the score of wellascertained causes and we will only say that they have been found enough to daunt the boldest seekers for a remedy the authoress of  hidden depths thinks she has only to take her bible in hand and the cure is found through the lips of her heroine she cries in answer to the objection that she is possibly compromising herself in attempting to reclaim one only out of a tribe better ignored altogether  one onlybut that one an immortal soul that never in all the eternal ages can cease to live and living to suffer if in the whole world there is not enough of compassion found to save her from a doom of such unitnagined horror one only but that one unspeakably precious in the sight of the god who made her for himself that we know his beloved son would have come down from heaven to die in his awful agony for her alone had she only of all the human race been perishing and sinful you speak of thousands like her is it not enough to crush ones very soul with horror to think of what they are in the sight of the righteous heaven and shall be probably for ever  and the thought that it is their own fellowcreatures who have thus blasted their souls with eternal ruin makes one wonder that god ehould still withhold the fire which one day must justly bu to ashes a world so cruel and so polluted and cm you think hugh that apart from the judgement which will fall upon the active agents in the ruin of the thousands of whom you speak there will be no account demanded of their blood from those who were passive instruments in their destruction who might have helped who might have saved them and would not  on such as i am who ought to be ready to give my whole life to win all and any i could am i to abstain from rescuing one one actually given into my hand because some painful humiliation some bitter thence may come to wound my vanity from those who make this worlds approval the idol of their worship oh what will all that wrlnd be to me wpi am lyidg cold and stiff in the grave whence there in no reaw  how much more then wctthless in that silent time of waiting wiu be its praise or blamthe praise or blame of those who will be dust and ashes ike myself but will not the doom of that owe lost soul be eveythiu to mete 0u1l that will meet me at e baer afjand out egieist m idden depths two vdojuxl u uin md dools6 you might have saved me and you did not therefore you are my condemnation you are my sentence you are my everlasting despair   we give this passage as a specimen of the authoresss style and as affording at the same time an indication of her enthusiastic unpractical view of the subject with which she has undertaken to deal in the course of her narrative however occasional remarks will be foundwith reference to homes for fallen women and analogous institutions for exampleindicative of a large capacity for actual work it appears hard to say that what she has done has been useless labour but the most we can hope from it is that it may serve to set thinking some who never thought before of this ugly side of their social existence by all means let anything and everything that can be done be done to save individual souls by earnest doers like the authoress of  hidden depths the more closely the subject of the social evil is looked at by intelligent women the more likelihood is there of means being found to mitigate the abomination it is beyond doubt in the power of women to give a purer tone to society by doing their best to discountenance all profligacy of life in the men of their own families as well as those with whom they are otherwise brought into contact at present nothing of the kind is done and so long as no  inconvenience results even notorious impurity of life is held to be no disqualification for a man in society indeed the man of many mistresses is an object of special interest and regard with thousands of women who would affect the utmost horror and indignation at being brought into personal relationship with any woman of sullied reputation but these remarks apply only to the upper classes among the lower classes where the horrors of the social evil spread widest it is useless to think of any such ameliorating influence as that which it is possible for the women of the superior classes to exert the authoress of  hidden depths  takes no account of unfortunates below the grade of gentlemens abandoned mistresses or of the mercenaries of university towns and in saying this perhaps we say enough to show that her earnestness has been spent upon a mere fragment or two of the innumerable wrecks that strew the deadsea shore of this miserable subject we are glad however to recognise in her present work signs of an admirable literary faculty read as a work of fiction we are sure that  hidden depths  will not fail to interest thoughtful readers far beyond the average of the seasons new novels,orthamerica

interesting though characters are well designed though not all of them carried out with equal success the ethics and morality are free from the morbid tendency to make misery by exaggerating a secondary point of duty and selfsacrifice at the expense of common sense and common justiceindeed to slaughter all other virtues to show greater honour to the selected onea mode of proceeding against which we have often protested in the present novel the just proportions of things to each other is preserved which much increases the pleasure of the reader the love of strong contrasts the magnifying of one quality to the starving and dwarfing of all others is a snare to young authors who think thereby to obtain strong situations and powerful effects holme lee has learned better we have met with few things superior to the account of margaret hawthorne sitting on the fallen tree in the dim twilight praying to be delivered from evil and kept from temptation knowing that the man who had cruelly and dishonourably wronged her by an illegal marriage had come back and was as she believed seeking her presence but not knowing that he had returned a free man with the design of  atoning for past wrong and winning present happiness by marrying her truly not knowing that even then he was standing close beside her although unperceived by her  finding instead of the beauty and the grace he

story her work being done margaret hawthorne has nothing to do with the afterstory though it takes its root in her life and death there is nothing in the rest of the book that comes near this short episode for simple tragical led  pathos and quiet restrained power there is no strong colouring very few epithets the incidents are indicated and shadowed out rather than detailedbut they are true to the life and death  the reader is touched with a pity deeper than words or tears can speak it the remainder of the story is taken up with the history of the career of the two brothers cyrus goes to his father and becomes a fine gentleman and a genius  he chafes against his bar sinister and resents the inconveniences of his own position fancying he is feeling his mothers wrongs it is not an interesting character nor very skilfully drawn it is composed of qualities which are laid on from the outside cyrus is not a living haman being and the reader wearies of him robert his brother is more successful but he too is made in mosaic of good qualities contrasting with those which make up his brother neither of them is more than an automaton constructed with pains and ingenuity some of the incidental characters are more successful lady leigh the benefactress of orphans is good  dorothea sancton is a charming sketch  for holme lee succeeds better in indicating character than in working out fulllength studies the descriptions of natural scenery are done with evident love and feeling for outofdoor nature only they are too numerous and too elaborate but the book as a whole is of a good quality and will deservedly add to though reputation holme lee has already acquired  against wind and tide novels by holme lee 3 vols smith  eldertbe expectations raised by  sylvan holts daughter mo amply fulfilled by the authoress in this new production in many respects indeed the present novel exhibits a marked improvement over her former work the style without any sacrifice of simplicity is richer and firmer while the characters are sketched with a more free and vigorous touch the plot of  against wind and tide is original and bold a wealthy baronet sir philip nugent betrays the pretty daughter of simon hawthorne a farmer residing in the isle of wight by a false marriage as the former lady nugent is still living the offence is not only one of deception but felony on discovering the trick the victim abandons her betrayer and flies back to her father with whom she resides for the rest of her life which is only prolonged sufficiently to enable her to bring up the two sons who were the off spring of her illstarred union until the lads had grown almost to the verge of manhood shortly before this sir philip reappears  his wife is dead and he at last enjoys an opportunity to repair so far as reparation is possible the cruel wrong he had inflicted this however he has not the grace to do but tries to compound the matter with his conscience by offering to make liberal provision for the boys one of them cyrus being gifted with a poetical which means an impulsive and selfish temperament accepts the offer and quits his mothers side to plunge amidst the pleasures of the great world under his fathers protection his brother robert remains at home and when mary hawthorne dies fulfils his original plan of entering the establishment of an uncle who carries on an extensive business as manufacturer of varnish in a large provincial town both of the brothers are however brought into situations where the social consequences of their false position and equivocal parentage come into play the shadow of the bar sinister rests on both and its effects upon their respective characters and careers is depicted with unusual fidelity and power it is indeed this struggle carried on under such very different conditions of circumstance and character against a  false position which forms the staple of the story in the end robert becomes head of the varnishmaking establishment and enjoys a fair allowance of domestic felicity cyrus passes through many vicissitudes of passion fame and fortune he writes poems which confer on him a brief popularity wins the love of a young lady whom his own father snatches from him by making her the second lady nugent commits diverse escapades gets terribly and ruinously into debt breaks with sir philip and comes to london to make his own way as poet journalist or miscellaneous adventurer in relating this portion of her heros career and especially when delineating the characteristics and habitudes of the very peculiar class whom mr wbitty has denominated  friends in bohemia the authoress has shown a keener and truer insight into the subject than almost any of those predecessors who have ventured upon the same tempting but slippery path ultimately cyrus also becomes rich and happy after narrowly escaping death by starvation in a london garret he inherits all bis fathers unentailed property and nunies of course the lady who has been safely educating for that distinguished position all along sir philip himself is perhaps if moral considerations alone prevailed let off much too easily he is a thorough and selfish villain but is allowed to enjoy a long and prosperous life chequered only by a few compunctions and an awkward dilemma or two but as moral justice or what we think such seldom rules the destinies of humanity in real life we must not complain if it is sometimes omitted from the artistic presentments of ideal life by the novelist in every respect  against wind and tide deserves to command not merely the brief popularity assigned to a successful  novel of the season but a respectable station among works destined for more enduring fame,orthamerica

B3502,['6732133'],  sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of

authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think him soour grandchildren will do neither our utmost stretch of indulgence is to excuse the sailor because he was only a sailor sailing away as a boy and all his life from the charmed circle of insular prejudice learning life by living and foreign peoples in their own homes instead of in british parlours lecturerooms and missionary meetings admiral hobart like many another sailor of vigorous understanding unsophisticated conscience and limited culture failed to appreciate the timehonoured prejudice which should have forbidden him to respect in the infidel those very virtues dignity sobriety fortitude domesticity truth generosity and love of justicewhich he had been taught to revere as the peculiar appanage of his own countrymen in his eyes the swindling greek was no better than the corrupt pasha the savage baehi bazouk no worse than the cutthroat bulgarian and none of them half so bad as the atrocitymonger he may be at times superficial and inaccurate but that his main views will ultimately prevail and that the simple adnals of his life now before us will come to be read with keener and more enlightened interest is a prognostication rather than a prophecy e

berber or the mountaineer of the atlas a tale of the sallee hovers by william starbuck mayo md author of  kaloolah bentley dr mayo is evidently afraid of the author of  kaloolah as a piece of grave exaggeration a wellsustained satire on the american practice of marvellous taletellingwe held and hold that romance to be unrivalled we admire the size of the writers lions the length of his boaconstrictors the magnificence of his cities and the splendour of his african kingsthe grandeur and originality of his whole system of pennyalining and we enjoyed more than one hearty laugh at the satirefor the magniloquent descriptions were more than relieved by slight touches of pathos and humour but the authors genius for quiet caricature appears to have well nigh exhausted itself in his first effortby the side of  kaloolah the  berber  pales its ineffectual fire the materials of the story are here much the same as in the former case this time the distressed and captured damsels are spaniards and christians their lovers areone a bold and famous pirate with the sound of whose dreaded name andalusian mothers frighten their refractory infants  the other a yet more famous chieftain of the berber tribe a white man and a christian who is trying to introduce the religion and civilization of europe into the mountain ranges of the atlas a medley of jews arabs moors and berbers make up the remainder ofthe dramatis personaan historical personage  muley ismael sultan of morocco plays a leading part in the story but the interest chiefly clings to the berber chief with his grand notions and inchoate reformations the tale is too crowded with incident and adventure for us to attempt to give even its outlines we shall therefore content ourselves with presenting an extract or two and leaving them to tell their own tale the following passage brings forward the despotand a message to him from the hero  it was morning at mequinez in a large court communicating with the garden of the hareem were assembled all the dignitaries of the court a body of black troops lined each side of the square four stalwart negroes lounged at a little distance from the archway by which the soltan was expected to enter these were the executioners the invariable attendants at a  meshourah or royal audience who at a look from their master could seize the unfortunate subject of the monarchs wrath and tossing him into the air let him fall so as to break any prescribed number of bones or to kill him outright in front of the areli were gathered the officers of the court the chief dignitaries of the city mingled with kaids and lieutenantkaids from morocco and fez and bashaws from the provinces of soos and tefilet at a little distance a group of four or five jews in black sk ulcap and bornoose cowered in deprecating attitude beneath the fierce looks of the negro guard a striking contrast was that lie i ween the insolent air of these black barbarians from the further side of the sahara and the subdueel voices and anxious looks of the maroquien courtiers  may god prolong the life of the soltan whispered a bashaw to the kaid of the gate  hast thou heard in what mood it has pleased his majesty to rise this morning  may the soltans life be prolonged replied the kaid  a eunuch just whispered me that it had pleased our lord the shereef to rise with his sword in his teeth and the word passed through the groups of anxious officials that something had gone wrong with his majesty during the night and that probably more than one head would roll from its shoulders in token of the soltans displeasure    long life and health to sidi may god preserve sidi shouted with one accord the courtiers at the same time prostrating themselves to the ground and crouching and cringing around the soltan endeavouring to touch his feet or to kiss his garments or the trappings of his horse the soltan however kept his horse in motion and his cimeter whirling and it was with no small expenditure of agility that his courtiers contrived to pay their customary salutations and yet to preserve their bodies from the horses hoofs or their necks from the steel as it was several turbans were already cut through and a dozen haicks were stained with blood when suddenly the soltan checked his horse and sheathing his cimeter with a growl of rage he passed his hands into the folds of his sash and drew out a paper  traitors he shouted glaring round upon his panting and terrified court  dogs whose work is this  who of you has dared to sell himself to the berber and the old monarch shook the paper with convulsive energy  read this he exclaimed to an officer who held the office of chief kaid of the gate the kaid advanced took the paper and alter kissing the hem of the imperial haick he read in a loud voice as follows to the powerful muley ismael emperor of morocco soos and tefilet whom god preserve in the paths of justice and mercy know that thy demand for more tribute than the free amazerg of the hills has of his own accord consented to pay is unjust know also that thy design to ravage the country of the ait amoor is known to me be warned in time and let there be peace between us i fear you not and wish you well in token whereof i pin this paper with my dagger to your pillow and not to your heart casbin el subah j i 1 what think you demanded the soltan when  i the kaid had finished   whence comes this who pinned that paper to my pillow  may god for ever preserve sidi but i know not replied the trembling kaid think you it was the berber chieftain himselfgod knows replied the kaid falling upon his knees god knows but you do not growled the soltan and yet you are kaid of the gatesmuley ishmael glared around upon his court with the look of a tiger selecting a victim and then raising his finger the four negroes darted upon the prostrate and grovelling form of the unfortunate officer  god is great and there i9 no god but god may he lengthen the life of sidi exclaimed the kaid but with the words in his mouth his body was whirled aloft on the extended arms ofthe gigantic negroes and then dashed head first with mortal loree upon the marble pavement the soltan stared lora moment with a grin of maniacal rage distorting his toothless mouth upon the lifeless body of the kaid while courtiers began to elevate their voices in expressions of admiration of his justice and goodness and in wishes for his long life and prosperity one moor however of a dignified mien and of ti complexion that would have compared for clearness and whiteness with that of the inhabitants of northern europe stood a little apart in silence he either could not or would not join in the sycophantic plaudits that were beginning to arise from all quarters of the court as the eyes of the monarch turned from the body of the kaid they fell upon the silent figure of the moor  hah  exclaimed the soltan  abdallah ibn asken  what thinkest thou of the justice of the shereef  to approve or disapprove in answer to such a question it was well known to lie attended with equal danger and for a moment abdallah stood without making any reply with a deepdrawn yell of concentrated passion muley ishmael spurred towards him  dog son of a christian you a descendant of the ommeyah of andalusia  he shouted and raising his sword let it fall with full force upon the head of the moor who as the blade descended received it without moving from his tracks luckily the thick turban afforded a partial defence but still the keen steel cleft the scalp and glancing inflicted a deep wound in the shoulder the sword itself by the force of the blow was wrenched from the soltans hand and flew out some distance on the pavement quietly abdallah turned took a few steps picked up the sword and deliberately wiped the bloody blade upon his haik isle then advanced to the emperor who sat motionless upon his horse and presenting the hilt bowed his head god is ged exclaimed abdallahand i submit to my fate at his hands and at the hands of the sherecf muley ismael although one of the most suspicious irritable and cruel tyrants that ever filled a throne had his moments of generosity from the extreme of passion it was no uncommon thing for him to pass to the extreme of kindness and condescension receiving the cimeter he returned it to its sheath and then unbuckling the belt handed it back to abdallah  receive this said the soltan oh worthy descendant of the royal ommeyah may god restore their dynasty to the throne of cordovareceive it as a token of our satisfaction that there is at least one brave and honest man in our court abdallah bowed himself to the stirrup of the soltan and kissed his foot muley ishmael placed his hand upon the moors head and raising it exclaimed in a loud voice long life to abdallah ibn asken chief kaid of the gates as historical heresy is the fashion of the times dr mayo asserts his right to dispute the old traditions of conquest mr disraeli has done his best to prove the intellectual preponderance of the mosaic arabsmr urquhart claimed a similar supremacy in mind and prowess for the saracensand now dr mayo comes forward to support the claims of the berbers that a civilised and noble people did once inhabit the southern provinces of spain is pretty certain and our author contends that the heroes and statesmen the poets and architects of seville and cordovathe warriors who routed alfonzo on the battlefield of zalaca and those who riotously swept the country up to the very mountains of asturiaswere not of arab but of berber origin we have no doubt that the american author could maintain his theory with as much plausibility as his european rivals do theirs but we have not space to discuss questions of history with the romancer he is more at home in his own element of marvels and masquerades heroes are always heroeseven in their teens and of course the mountaineer of the atlas performed exploits in his youth the sheik of arbazza was a shereef and a saint began the rais in a low but distinct voice he was of a pure arabic stock and n bitter hater of the berbers he was also the wealthiest man in all the kingdom of fez and among his riches he possessed one thing that he valued more than all the rest a mare of the most famous blood of duquella her pedigree could be traced back for ages and the fame of her beauty and her speed filled the whole land she was a thoroughbred deafener and winddrinker she was as the apple of his eye anil proud was the sheik of arbazza that he was the owner of a creature that for beauty fire speed and endurance could not be matched travel the world over the sheik of arbazza was at feud with several of his neighbours both of plain and hill and numerous attempts were made by his enemies and if the truth must be told by several of his friends to dispossess him of his favourite but the sheik was a wary man and vain were all the efforts of treacherous friends and open enemies he was also a boastful and an arrogant man and he prided himself not a little on his ability to defeat anel punish any attempt to carry off the descendant of the famous maha el pahr or steed of the sea already had several gallant and adventurous spirits perished and more had failed and been driven hack in disgrace when the vanity of the sheik slipped the bridle of prudence and gallopped ott with him without cheek or restraint he published an invitation to all who felt disposed to steal his famous mare he announced a defiance to the boldest and most adroit horsestealers in all the empire he even offered in his vain sense of security a reward of a thousand gold metzcals to whoever should succeed in earning off el ilassaneh or the beautiful of course after this the watchfulness of the sheik was not relaxed or los precautions decreased each night the mare was picketted by the door of his tent one end of an iron chain was put around her leg and locked and the key deposited in the sheiks girdle the other end of the chain was brought within the tent passed under the sheiks bed and fastened to the tent pole within reach of his hand stood his loaded gun the match always burningand the sheik was the most famous marksman of the tribes without the tent a pack of the largest and fiercest dogs threatened every intruder with instant death among the enemies of the sheik the principal one consisted of a portion of the beni mozarg and of course nothing would have delighted the berbers more than for one of their number to have achieved the feat of carrying off the sheiks famous mare on though one hand was every inducement to attempt the adventurepride revenge the love of glory and an admiration of horseflesh but on the other hand there were too many obstacles in the waythe distance to the plains the difficulty of approaching the dounh the canine guards the chain and more than ali the watchfulness and prowess of the sheik these obstacles had been found by repeated experiments insurmountable and the very bravado ofthe sheik while it was looked upon as the worst of insults helped to deter the boldest of thc berbers from undertaking the adventure at that time casbin son of the amekran of the beni mozarg was scarce turned of thirteen hut already had he killed the king of beasts and acquired the name of el subah or the lion it was noticed that the young prince was for days busy in constructing a strong basket or rather cage the holes in it were just wide enough to admit a hounds nose and the withes were of the stoutest kind and wound with strips of untanned hide the basket excited much curiosity but not a word did the young chieftain vouchsafe as to the purpose to which it was to be applied but great i waa the surprise when catching a common cat he enclosed her in the

distance he slipped from his horse secured him in a moment and advanced to the tent slowly noiselessly with his breast to the ground the young prince crept up and put hu head in under the curtain all was dark save a fiuv glimmer that came from the womens apartment the sheik was asleep casbin drew his body into the tent the first thing he did was to feel for the gun which he noiselessly emptied of the ball and replaced in its position he then drew his knife and stretching himself by the side of the sheik deliberately began cutting through his woollen sash firs on one side and then on the other the slumber of the sheik were far from sound but so quietly and skilfully was the operation conducted that hews not awakened nor any alarm given to the other inmates of the tent the front turns of the sash were lifted from the sleeper upon running his hand through the folds casbin lighted at once upon the key the most difficult part of the adventure was achieved casbin stuck his dagger in the ground ia front of the sheiks face and as slowly and as noelessly as before crept under the door curtain of the tent there stood the noble animal el hamnth the beautiful the rain had ceased the clouds had suddenly broken away and the bright starlight mingled with the first faint sheen of dawn revealed her beautiful proportions to the young prince but not long did he tarry to admire he took one look to make sure that it was indeed she the muchpraised and oftdescribed beauty and then applying the key to the padlock liberated her foot from the chain he threw over her head a hempen bridli he freed her fetlocks from the cords by which she was picketted he vaulted on her back oh sheik ali shouted the youth come forth and bid adieu to your favourite no answer wo returned and casbin springing lightly to the ground seized the end of the chain and giving it a vigorous shake vaulted again to the back of el hassaneh come forth oh most arrogant sheik of arbazza shouted casbin  your mare will not leave you without returning you thanks for your favours the curtain ofthe tent was thrown violently aside one glance showed to the horrorstricken sheik hil favourite freed from her chain and with some one on her back he hesitated not an instant with a groan of rage he raised his gun to his shoulder and fired what was his astonishment to find that the audacious rider still preserved his seat the report of the gun and the burst of boyish laughter that followed it aroused all the inhabitants of the down the arabs came pouring out of their tents obmost renowned sheik cried the prince  thou

B5428,"['8979712', '6808116', '6771830']",  the conquest of charlotte by david s rmw kj9 meldrum blackwood  sons mk meldrums latest fifeshire romance is good reading one feels perhaps some small sense of irritation at the way in which old characters continually disappear and new ones are evolved throughout the 392 closely printed pages yet this is a small blemish to set against the conception of rab the rascal who one is thankful to find continues his eccentric course to the last he is a fascinating character mr meldrum shows that it is not necessary in writing of the scots to descend into a sea of unintelligible patois the whole book comes as a welcome relief after those which would lead us to believe that the inhabitants of scotland devote their entire energies to analysing their own and their neighbours religious convictions in interminable pages imperiously demanding a glossary the story steers skilfully between the scylla of patois and the charybdis of pawkiness it is in fact a marked advance on anything the author has yet produced  fiction the conquest of charlotte bv david s meldrum blackwood 6s mr meldrum is not one of the many gentlemen whose names are the commonplaces of publishers lists so far as we know tjie conquest of charlotte makes only his fourth book and his second novel readers of the story of margredel many of them at any rate saw in that story qualities of freshness and discernment which gave promise of a writer who would qfi day search more deeply into life and present them with a study more subtle and more detached and here in the conquest of charlotte we have that study a book clearly devised and written with the utmost and most loving care full of colour in character as well as in the brave shows of nature yet it falls short of complete success and that for two reasons it is overelaborated in manner and unessentials and it is too external the two things seem to go together  while we are often surprised by the finish of the setting we ar conscious of a certain shadowiness of characterisation we do not feel that here right under our fingers is the full pulse of life from this generalisation however we would exclude the elder charlotte the mother of the younger charlotte whose conquest furnishes the sentiment of the book the older woman is nobly conceived and perhaps because mr medrum has treated her rather more broadly than others of his characters she wins more surely to our affection and belief it is upon the study of rab cuick the smuggler and father of the second charlotte that mr meldrum seems to have concentrated himself the girl is well enough but she never grips us like her mother nor has mr meldrum succeeded in contriving for her anything so delightful as the  cast shoe chapter of her mothers youth rab cuick does not quite as it were get home rascal he was but his delinquencies were hardly of the kind to inspire his family with the fear and disgust which move them yet we feel that mr meldrum was himself wholly convinced by rab there must have been subtleties of spiritual mischief in the man which he has not succeeded in conveying to us the better side of him his fine love of freedom and the open and his curious misguided pride mr meldrum has succeeded in presenting writh perfect success it is when he comes to the delicate psychology of rab that we lose our way the general manner of the story is too diffuse again and again the flow of the narrative is checked for the introduction of extraneous matter often good in itself but without value to the scheme of the book the possible verisimilitude for instance gained by the introduction of the pedigree of a minor character does not compensate for our sense of annoyance there are descriptions of locality too so complicated that only a map could render them perfectly clear and this brings us back to that question of overelaboration mr meldrums pages are crowded with simile and metaphor these are often fine the book is full of a balanced and beautiful exaltation but they are run too hard let us illustrate  the verity of our freedom did not steal upon us like the dawn athwart the eastern headlands but plumped into our consciousness with tropic wonder that sudden flash of poetry in mr foster illumining the sordid round of his schoolmastering was like the crimson burst at long years interval upon the cactusplant charging his prickliness for me with incipient tenderness perhaps these two random examples standing by themselves hardly sufficiently enforce our point but when similar matter occurs continually it will de seen that the reader is not to be blamed if he wearies of mr meldrums indirectness yet when all is said the conquest of charlotte remains a book to be seriously considered mr meldrum is primarily and essentially a literary artist that his work is a little too selfconscious is one of the defects of his qualities  indeed it is only on applying a strictly critical standard that such faults as we have pointed out become manifest arid to apply that standard to most  successful novels would be to damn them in a line mr meldrum is one of the very few living novelists wthose

books are both in matter and manner far above the average she invariably compels attention and repays the attention which she thus forces in the coin of intellectual pleasure the present story is well suited to take its place beside mrs whartons previous volumes its extent is not considerable but mrs whartons very restraint in the matter of words has increased the power which she so ably wields her example might well be followed by many a novelist by whom superfluity of verbiage is almost acclaimed as a virtue many of them ought to be willing to sacrifice much in order to be able to produce a

novel mrs wharton has done all and more than other novelists would have done in the greater space there is no living novelist who knows better how to construct a story the book is a model of compression every stroke tells every detail of conversation or incident has its essential place in the structure but the effect is not that of thin economy it is rich and full in the earlier part of the story there are incidents the suggestions of which are grimly and tragically realised in the conclusion mrs wharton has a skill which she can only have learned from the greek tragedians in preparing by dramatic contrasts irony and reversal of fortune for the passionate denouement but no skill alone could have produced such stress and tenseness such exaltation and depression so highly emotional a romance brought to the dust with realistic cruelty to mrs whartons vivid and romantic imagination is added a hard sense of fact conceive the elated moods of stevenson tempered by the grimmest touches of zola and you have the holocaust of romantic passion and horrid fact which mrs wharton can serve up to us she prepares us for the catastrophe from the beginning showing to us the

his meagre farm coming in to starkfield rarely and speaking seldom for he has had troubles and the neighbours respect his gloom and then we see him in his youth aged twentyeight when the trouble is brewing his home is shared by two women one is his wife zeena older than himself who had nursed his dying mother whom he had married from sheer dread of solitude she is tall bony fretful a nalade imaginaire nursing herself on patent medicines her teeth are false she looks hideous in bed she complains at everything and nags mrs zeena from is shown in the fewest words of conversation and

work of a hired girl without wages the situation is obvious enoughbut nothing is banal when it comes under mrs whartons hand ethan adores mattie a years companionship with two such women has wrought upon him in a sense it is a mere lovestory the love of ethan for a woman to whom he must not declare himself and the  this is our second notice of elhau frow love of mattie for ethan but it is a lovestory invested with the true tragic poignancy the two are only driven to selfrevelation by the jealousy and remorselessness of zeena for one day and night zeena goes away to see a doctor and hatch her plot in the evening ethan and mattie sit by the fire in the usual manner save that the seat of zeena is empty they talk about indifferent matters shyly and in dread of breaking the sweetness of their one evening they shun the name of zeena which creeps into their conversation hauntingly as a thing of dread and ethan sees mattie as she might be in his house were zeena dead we know no

resolve on one more rush down the slope not past but into the dreaded elm we merely point out that this magnificent tempestuous passage concerning the lovers resolve to die is followed by the far grimmer conclusion the taking away of the two maimed but not dead bodies and the subsequent years of sinister grumbling and ugliness that is the way in which mrs wharton nerves herself to end her

as are presented by ethan from and zeena his wife to say nothing of mattie there was material for a great though somewhat sombre and tragic work miss wharton has suggested this and in the slight

principal characters of which are historic mrs stow endeavours to depict the mannera and austere religious life of new england at the close of the last century she especially commends her work to the kindly  1 thoughts of the british firesidea compliment j c which we predict the british public will repay 11 by asking for the story at the circulating libra  s ries and in due course coming to the conclusion j that notwithstanding numerous blemishes which go a long way towards counterbalancing its i merits it is a tale to be read and for nine days  to be talked about the critical few will find amusement in comparing an american ladys description of the transatlantic puritanism to which whitfield imparted fresh earnestness more than a hundred years ago with the light satiric view taken of the same subject by mr thackeray in  the virginians the ministers wooing is a love tale a religious novel and an historicor rather biographicfiction all in one regarded as the first it deserves almost unqualified praise judged of as the second it merits a certain amount of blame but viewed as an illustration of history it is open to very grave censure the opening chapters as we indicated last december induce the reader to hope he is going to be treated with a series of simple domestic episodes although his feelings are early harrowed with an enumeration of the horrors of the slave trade but unfortunately these expectations are to a certain extent disappointed and the whole question of negro emancipation is dragged up for rediscussion in this the author has acted very unwisely with all its misstatements and onesidedness exaggeration and reticence uncle toms cabin was a powerful story and created a memorable sensation  equal perhaps to that caused amongst educated english people almost two hundred years before by afra behns oroonoko the first  nigger novel of our literature mrs stow would have decided well for her fame if imitating the caution of hamilton with his famous speech she had allowed this bril liant success to remain in solitary splendour and had not lessened its effect by endeavouring to repeat it the reception that  dred met with in this country must have convinced her that her english admirers were weary of listening to the cracking of legrees whip and that their craving for imagined woes must for some time to come be gratified with more refined sorrows than the tortures of slavemarkets and plantations down south very likely mrs stow is well aware of all this for the tone of her arguments against slavery in the present work is milk and honey in comparison with the scalding indignation of the story that first brought her into notoriety there is a wide difference between the inspired angel of abolition who penned  uncle toms cabin and the calm argumentative lady who in  the ministers wooing is content with coldly enunciating the moral obligation of all men to help the oppressed and this change can only be accounted for on the supposition that either she has so far outlived the ardour of her earlier impressions that what a few years since would have been the language of fervid poetry is now nothing more than a mere habit of sermonizing or else that accurately appreciating the state of public feeling she only breathes gently on the embers of a dying enthusiasm well knowing that a stronger current of air would altogether extinguish the feeble sparks that still linger in them the scheme of that part of the story on which the rest of the narrative is hung is simple and pretty enough the drama opens with a teaparty in the parlour of the widow scudder who is a lady blessed with a small farm and  a gambrelroofed cottage on the outskirts of newport a charming daughter the heroine a sweet little maiden just emerging from chudj hoodand a high reputation for the possession j of  faculty the precise meaning of which term  may be found in the athenmtm for december  25 1858 j the principal inmate of the widow scudders house is dr h the minister who does the wooing a divine of extreme calvinistic j opinions of pure life and of a gentle nature  a man dwelling in a world of spiritual abstraci tions guileless and simpleminded as a child  austere in his habits and of inflexible firmness of principle studious and abstracted he is a kind of coleridge divested of poetic faculty and imbued with moral stability the good man is a bachelor something over forty years of age and besides officiating zealously amongst j his congregation ministering to his afflicted j black brethren and writing a profound system i of divinity finds time to act to the fair mary scudder his landladys daughter the part that abelard did to heloise he is her tutor in religious and secular studies and she in return instructs him in the art of loving but unlike heloise of old mary only conceives for him that reverential affection which a young maiden naturally entertains for her pastor who appears to her an the expression of all the goodness that is possible in humanity the widow scudder would gladly see her daughter love the pastor dearly enough to wish to be his wife  but the meek gentle child wilful in one thing only bestows her heart on a wicked scapegrace of a cousin james marvyn who having run 31 away from home and been to sea returns from 3 foreign countries to laugh at the sanctimonious ways of the godly people of newport and to question the doctrine of election and predestination the young man of course is condemned by the surrounding respectability as r utterly reprobate and poor little mary is con tinually being informed that her cousin her playmate from infancy her dearest cousin is doomed to eternal perdition the child has also amongst other tenets of that religion which calvinism grafted on the stern nature of the puritan colonists called into existence has been taught that it is her duty to contemplate the idea of her own eternal punishment with lively pleasure if by such suffering the happiness of mankind at large could be increased naturally she applies this terrible doctrine to the state of her own mind in relation to her cousin until she feels she could willingly surrender herself a sacrifice to neverending torment in order to secure him admission to an eternity of bliss one afternoon james has a stolen interview with her to say farewell as next day he is about to start on a long

man of her choice and sets his face resolutely forward to do his duty in that unwedded life which it seems providence has designed for him  you all know he said turning to mary who sat very near him  the near and dear relation in which i have been expecting to stand towards this friend i should not have been worthy of that relation if i had not felt in my heart the true love of a husband as set forth in the new testament who should love his wife even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it and if in case any peril or danger threatened this dear girl and i could not give myself for her i had never been worthy the honour she has done me for i take it wherever there is a cross or a burden to be born by one or the other that the man who is biade in the image of god as to strength and endurance should take it upon himself and not lay it upon her that is weaker for he is therefore strong not that he may tyrannise over the weak but bear their burdens for them even as christ for his church i have just discovered he added looking kindly upon mary  that there is a great cross and burden which must come either on thia dear child or on myself through no fault of either of us but through gods good providence and therefore let me bear it mary my dear child i will be to thee as a father but i will not force thy heart this is touching and well told but how does it all square with the facts on which the story ia founded who is this good dr h this pattern minister so forgetful of himself where the happiness of others is concerned who subsequent to the declaration of independence is represented as forty years of age childless and unwived  he is no other than the celebrated samuel hopkins dd pastor of the first congregational church in newport and cofounder with jonathan edwards of that awful that indescribably ferocious system of calvinistic theology known as the hopkintonian or hopkinsian but unfortunately for the truthfulness of mrs stowes tale samuel hopkins was born in the year 1721 and did not settle in newport till the year 1770 consequently instead of being forty at the outset of his wooing which commences after the recognition of american independence by england he must be regarded as more than sixty years old but further dr hopkins married in 1748 joanna ingersol who presented him with eight children and livea with him as his wife till her death on the last day of august in 1793 and on the 14th of september 1794 the doctor then in his seventyfourth year married again taking for his second wife miss elizabeth west a lady only sixteen or seventeen years younger than himself it is a matter of certainty that samuel hopkins was in no respect such a man as mrs stow has depicted him it is true that he was an abolitionist and published in 1776 a dialogue concerning the slavery of the africans but instead of being a shiftless dreamer incapable of looking after his worldly interests and wanting a religious landlady to rouse him up and tell nim when he was hungry he was a keen and energetic man and as well able to make a bargain as any other citizen of the united states although he owned a farm and made considerable sums by his literary productions he threatened to quit his congregation at newport if they could not provide comfortably for him and mrs stow can scarcely be ignorant of how active he was in organising prayermeetings amongst his flock such misrepresentations as these altogether overstep the limits which ought to restrain the imagination of a writer of historic fiction in such composition it is allowable to exercise the imagination in amplifying and giving colour to the views of history by the creation of any series of positions and incidents which are in accordance with recorded facts but surely a too daring disregard of veracity is exhibited by though writer who professes to sketch the life of an eminent person and at the same time misrepresents it in the most important particulars what object can mrs stow have in saying that her story is founded on facts when the masterincident of the book is pure fiction are the facts of uncle toms cabin of a similar kind  other historical characters besides dr hopkins are brought on the stage but not with greater felicity col aaron burr figures away with madame de frontignac deluging that lady and all the rest of the fair sex whom he addresses with very awkward adulation but this is a slight fault and one easily accounted for doubtless it has been mrs stowes pro vince throughout life to receive rather than to pay compliments we cannot discuss at length the religious side of this novel in that respect it forms a striking contrast to the tales of miss sewell being marked by a boldness of speculation and language which one would in vain look for in the writings of our own countrywomen it is we are willing to believe written in a devout and reverential spirit but it is to be regretted that one of the saddest exhibitions of the perverseness of the human intellect when directed to the contemplation of sacred mysteries should have been dragged into a pretty love story to disfigure ana even to mar it the eicture of mrs marvyns agony on hearing of er sons death and her despair of his salvation is as revolting a spectacle of spiritual buffering as uncle tom dying under the whips of his persecutors was of bodily torture if the hook should become popular its success will be won not by its polemical qualities but by the winning graces of the heroine and her little friend of the great world verginie in the construction and elaboration of marys character genuine artistic power is manifested in conception it lacks originality for in many respects she is a combination of longfellows evangeline and that form of youngladyism which has for some years been fashionable in american novels and many features of her mind and incidents of her life have been taken with judicious selection from the numerous puritan memoirs which formed an important division of american literature in the last and few preceding generations the memoirs of mrs harriet neweu and hopkinss memoirs of miss susanna anthony who died at newport rhode island in 1791 have manifestly been carefully read by mrs stowe in conclusion we may add that amongst the pleasant peculiarities of the book are innumerable americanisms some of them intentionally and some unconsciously employed by the author to educate young ladies is to  fetch them up and a matron wno superintends her domestic servants is said  to follow them round prominent too amongst its national characteristics the reader will notice the authors passion for  talking philosophy her familiar mention of plato as  an old heathen and her anxiety to display an intimate acquaintance with the art galleries and cathedrals of europe the annoyance of our transatlantic cousins at their own want of the memorials of ancient art is one of their most patent foibles and we are not awafre that it was ever more humorously expressed than by the new york merchant who on being reminded amidst the ruins of pompeii that his country was entirely devoid of any such interesting relics answered  yes

credit to any man living there is her husband cato ua smallbuilt nice softlyspoken negro addicted to a gentle chronic cough to whom candace held with a vehement and patronising fondness so devoid of

the stomach of an ostrich in their digestion but these characters have little to do with the story which as we have intimated is a picture of life and manners which existed in new england in the early days of lier national existence whether it will be as jmiptilar as i neb tutu thin we cannot say in that tab mrs stow appealed to two great sections  the grave and the gay of the general public in the present case she appeals to a more select audience we rise from the perusal of ber later work with an inc tcaxed admiration of the writers powers there is a beauty and a pathos in this work an

startling enough there is nothing improbable about them still we must receive themn with caution that excellent woman mrs c m kirkland he writes said to the author shortly after the fall of fort sumter if you cannot shoulder a musket you can blow a bugle the book before us is the bugle and the blast against slavery blown from it is very lond indeed in mr fairfaxs  elopement which we noticed in the londox revivw may 16 an attempt and not an unsuccessful one was made to show how little practical sympathy for the degro exists in the northern states but though the writer vehemently pressed his argument he was unable to conceal that while the condition of the slave in the southern states under a benevolent proprietor is far better than that of the free negro in the north nothing can be more wretched than his case if he has the misfortune to belong to a savage mrs fanny kembles residence in georgia which we reviewed in our number of the 6th of june gave us a picture of slavelife on an estate which had the reputation of being humanely managed making allowance for the colouring which a woman possessed of strong feelings and considerable eloquence could not help ging to such a subject the facts which she recounted materially affected our estimate of the creature comforts enjoyed by the slave even under a kind uster the book before us written with strong abolitionist ypathies leads us to believe that humane as mrs kembles husband may have been his estate did not resent a fair specimen of slavelife in the south when mitigate by the benevolence of the owner mr kirkes desrptio xy sother fremda by bdaund kirao autor of asu th phos low son x of the slaves on mr prestons estate shows us the northeast pbis ultra of negro happiness in the south and from the picture he has drawn of their comforts and the paternal care of their owner we are induced to believe that he has blown his bugle more in sorrow than in anaer unfortunatelyr this term  paternal care  has a double imieanimg that a man shall have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing her husbands attachment to his offspring by phyllis by parting with her trinkets kirke and preston find phyllis while she is yet in the hands of the slavetrader at a village store in north carolinah er figure was slight and graceful and her face very beautiful she bad long black glossy hair straight regular features a rich olive complexion and large lustrous eyes which as she sat opposite the open door were fixed on the thick gloomy wood with an earnest almost agonised gaze as if she were reading in its tangled depths the dark uncertain future that lay before her never shall i forget the expression of her face never have i seen its look of keen intense agony and its full perfect utter despair one of the children was a little girl of eight years with a sweet hopeful expression a clear rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons plantation near newbern here we find that prestons humanity to his slaves is ruining him and that with a hundred and fifty darkies he is going to the dogs while a certain colonel dawsey with only seventyfive works his estate at a profit preston explains how the colonel is so successfuldawsey has seventyfive slaves forty childbearing women twenty men and fifteen children under five years the sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their children and the waking rest necessary to working people he never whips them on a weekday because it wastes working time but makes sunasy a general flogging season he has two women where he has one man and each woman is expected to bear a child every second year if she doesnt she is sold they are made to work in the field till the labour pains are on them and arm allowed only two weeks res ar confinement three of them have born children in the woods this season he keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children and as soon as each child is five years oldthe ag at which it can be legay sold awra from its motherit is disposed of to the trades in addition three of these women are his mixtresse and they must bave children as fast as the others he serves their children like the rat that is rears them to the age of five and then sells them as he would so many hogs mr kirke does not confine himself to details which tell against slavery his deseption of ms preston shows how the highest womanly qualities can flourish side by side with the most hateful of social institutions she was a perfect womana faithful mistress a loving wife a devoted mother an every want of her husband rully

beautiful with human love suich women mr kirke writes are seen nowhere more often than in the south her husband too was solicitous for the religious wellbeing of his slaves his connexion with phyllis had terminated with his conversion to nobler thoughts and he taught his slaves their catechism and regularly attended the ministrations of the negro preacher old joe his grandfathers son by one of the old reprobates slaves side by side with the negros pitiable condition there is a vein of irresistible grotesqueness running through his life in nothing nmore remarkable than in his religious exercises joe had a rival in his clerical vocation a negro named jack whose gift was prayer and whose predilection was whisky the predilection was necessary to the full development of the rift mr kirke went to hear him open the sunday service gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment he drawled out my bredrin less us raise our hearts ter de lord the whiuce congregation then kneeled and jack closing his eyes clenching his hands together and throwing his bead back until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building  lifted up his voice and prayed  after the fashion of very many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob us dat hab come inter de worse sence hab stumbled an broke de law case he did how noah though he was a white man and had a white wife begat a black son and how that black son was a great sinner and how all his descendants have taken after him and been mighty big sinners ever since  then he described the sinner particularly the black sinners preeent and if half of what he said was tie every one of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed

the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand

subsided to a dead calm those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all the responses with great propriety but some of the congregation seemed less familiar with the service when joe repeated the words if any man kin show cause why dese olks should not be lawfully jined togedder less him now speak or ele fbr eber hole his peace dinah turned to the audience and cried out yas jess less him come out wid it now rd like ter see de man dats got

followed by a dance in which master joe prestons son1 makes himself conspicuous as roseys partner in one of the sets for his marvellous dancing but when the young mother is confined her child is white preston to his horror discovers that his son ignorant of the girls parentage is the father overwhelmed by this shock by his wifes cruelty and extravagance and by the hopeless state of his affairs hie dies and now mrs preston learns from phylliss slave husband that selma who has all along been supposed to be prestons daughter of pure white breed is the oflfpring of his amour with phyllis the girl has received the highest education and has grown up into a wouman of surpassing loveliness mr kirke describes her appearance at the opera in boston her mother was almost white her father pure white of such parentage selma is not the only issue famed for extraordinary beauty and now comes the crowning interest of the story selina is bought by her brother joe but frankan adopted son of mr kirkes and the illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread

fourteenth cup of weak tea  sister what a great deal of water you make mo drink in order to get a little tea  was his answer and it comes to our mind while reading this collection of stories it has mr leland says in the preface not been  made on the grimm principle of  pleasing tales for the nursery it is startling to hear that the brothers grimm had the nursery in their minds when they set the stone of collecting folktales rolling but it is manifest that miss owen cannot have had it in hers for except in an american not to say a missourinursery her book will be almost unintelligible some words are obscure even to grownup people and it is hard to have to toil through so much negroenglish before we can enjoy the items of true folklore earnest clear and welldefined that are promised by mr leland the promise is fulfilled there is a great deal of valuable folklore in the stories but it is injured not only by the uncouth dialect but by being laboriously introduced into the conversation of five negresses and one child who draws thenout one negress is from ole feginney another was bornded in tennisee but mosly brung up in mizzoury  a third has a french father a fourth a fox indian while the fifth aunt mymee is spoken of as the only pureblooded african of the group an african sorceress is indeed her mother but she is anxious to have it generally understood that her other parent was the devil she is acquainted with the mysteries of voodooism and can trick men and beasts and to trick in negroenglish means more than in english proper she lays  a turrble trick  on some dogs but

simpler than that of her associates miss owen who has we are told been initiated sufficiently into the mysteries of voodooism to divine its full scope and nature means to give her knowledge to the world at some future time that being the case she does not give so much of it now as we should like but what she does give is most interesting aunt mymee has a luckball which she believes contains her soul as well as her luck she calls it by her own name and bathes it in whiskey once a week to preserve its strength full directions are given for the making wearing and treatment of a luckball it is a

mary alicia owen fisher unwin this quaint volume is from the pen of the southern lady whose paper on  missourinegro folklore was one of the good things at the folklore congress of 1891 she now appears in the guise of the flaxenhaired listener irreverently dubbed towhead for whose benefit a remarkable group of black women pour out their treasures of ancient fable the form and method of the book recall of course uncle pe mus but the likeness stops there considered as humorous literature old rabbit cannot perhaps rank with the masterpiece of  joel chandler harris   but from the point of view of the folklorist it has a far higher value both are collections of  animal myths founded on widespread and immemorial traditions with many modern glosses derived from misunderstood phenomena and adorned with detail varying with the different races by whom they have been handed down but whereas uncle remus is saturated with the modern plantation nigger in miss owens book the bed indian medicine man is predominant and there is also a considerable tincture of the aboriginal african witchdoctor the stories here set down for us come from the missouri border where there is a large black population of mixed indian and negro blood a blend which not only has an individual flavour of its own but seems to have preserved certain voodoo elements not generally met with in the states about voodooism we know comparatively little but no doubt as mr leland tells us in his preface it is distinguished from aryan and also from red indian magic by its reliance not so much on penance and invocation as  on daring what is horrible and repulsive the discrimination of these different elements in miss owens stories is an engaging task for the reader who will also notice the considerable literary skill she shows both in the telling of the stories and in the portraits of those who tell them a the voodoo king if a slightly revolting and simian personage is typical and the black sibyls who foregather in the cottage of granny are admirably distinct in character speech and appearance chief of them is granny herself devoted to  the folks at the house whose slave she once was who claims to be a descendant of   them injuns dat hilt de kyentry fo de white folks come dar  a pedigree generally admitted notwithstanding her crisp white wool and pronounced negro appearance next is big angy or mrs boogarry whose fulldress name is madame angelique bougareau a double cross of indian negro and creolea fervent catholio and firm believer in heathen witchcraft with the nose of an eagle the eye of a hawk the mouth of a cat and hair like the tail of a black horse she swears in french and allows her worthless husband to gamble away her small earnings explaining her want of thrift by saying  me daddy was a great french hunter and me mammy was chile tu de big chief of de iowas dey no put by lak the squirl in de hole then there is the fat and jolly aunt emly with her high indian cheek bones and oily black ringlets  and aunt my mee the nurse  the only pureblooded african and the only coppercoloured person in the party the child of a guinea sorceress she would fain have her friends believe that she had the devil for a father and was so far successful that not one of them ever went to bed without pouring a cup of seeds on the doorstep and hearth lest in the night mymee should arrive by the threshold or the chimney and ride on their chests tie their hair in knots or perform somo of the other pleasantries for which your witch in all countries is famous a pleasing foil to these old negresses is tow head herself the little white girl whom they combine to spoil and petpositive and perverse and a passionate lover of the witch story some of her own sayings are in the happiest vein as when after hearing though nigger version of aesops fox who through his braggart humour fell a victim to the hounds  all except de bresh she bursts out with 441 hate a story that kills somebody and i know how foxies lations felt for some hunters came by here you know and their dogs killed my kitten i cried awfully and heard grandma say to mamma that i seemed to feel that i had lost a lation i didnt really for i have so many lations and only had just that one sweet kitty there is a whole series of rabbit stories usually funny though containing nothing quite equal to the tarbaby episode in which uncle remuss chartered libertine so nearly gets his  comeuppence we would call particular attention to this among other new and delightful words by which the blacks vocabulary is richer than the whites the rabbit with miss owen is much more of a magician much less an incarnation of the nigger than with  joel chandler harris  and a similar distinction is noticeable between the bird and reptile personages in the two collections chief among the birds is of course the woodpecker who was a very early bird at magical work for did not picus martius take romulus and remus from the month the umbrian augurs knew him well and in the eugubine tables we find the directions parfa kurnase dersua peiqu peica merstu by interpretation of prof donaldson  parram cornicem dextras picum picam simistros and it is noticeable that it is about these same birds that miss owens clients have most to tell us her woodpecker is however a far greater personage than the classical picus the king turned into a bird because he declined to serve a witchs sensual phantasy he is lord of the woods the greatest of all the magicians he makes the bat out of a mouse and a goatsucker and gives the redbird his gay plumage and endows his friends with all the good fortune and all the moral excellences that pallas and hera offered to paris perhaps this redheaded bird with his weird laughing cry the peculiar mimicry of his plumage and his curious exploratory methods of feeding is to be identified with the redcap goblins found all over europe but there is a vast difference between the treasureseeking folletto coila beretta of europe and the great sorcerer of the american continent perhaps the most curious passage in old rabbit is that in which the authoress describes the manufacture of a luckball price one dollar for the benefit of mr leland himself it is compounded of red clover substituted for the hair of the propositus dust white yarn sewing silk and tinfoil the whole tied in innumerable knots and plentifully moistened with libations of whiskey from the mouth of the voodoo king the knots are of the essence of the contract being four times four times four circe turned round four times

B2039,['3167331'],  the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,orthamerica

nelsons captain old thomas fuller sir walter raleigh and to name no others thomas hardy who has put so much of dorset scenery and character into his novels and whose birthplace is pointed out at upper bockingham  an ancient cottage almost hidden from sight by the bushes of its old garden on the one hand and by the slope of the downs on the other also these pages are rich in rumours and remembrances of old wars and glamorous romantic happenings you have glimpses of king charles lying hidden at charmouth after the flight from worcester of monmouth fleeing along the secluded lanes after the rout of sedgemoor of the tragic progress of jeffreys and the bloody assize all the story of what dorset has been mingling with the story of what it is now and then sir frederick strikes a more personal note

pretty artistic experiment to begin with intense passion is rarely articulate and the passion which expresses itself in sonnets accompanied by an epexegetic commentary is incomprehensible but in

reflections for every day in the year on the works of god which saw the light in 1775 and had a vogud much longer and considerably wider than the most successful novels of modern times have obtained or are likely to obtain it was translated into french english dutch danish and swedish the philosophy of sturm tends to the conviction that man exists under the best of all possible conditions and he expresses a devout thankfulness for the presence of fertilising saltpetre in snow one of the most amusing paragraphs relates an ingenious calculation of the number of risen bodies that will be present at the general resurrection sturm takes an average of the yearly number of deaths in the town of hamburg from the date of the flood then by a bold speculation as to the date of the millennium he is able to continue his average to the end of time all that remains to be done is to express a proportion between the number of inhabitants of hamburg and the number of inhabitants of the world and sturm

aloud after a days sport the dies ira in which the following stanza occurs lacrymosa dies illa qua resurget ex favilla judicandus homo reus  huic ergo paree deua  the  ergo  is objected to as a  senseless word referring to nothing but to which strength and meaning can be given by simply changing qua in the second line to qua3 when the lines would signify oh that mournful day what shall arise out of the ashes  guilty man to be judged him therefore spare oh god  improving an unimprovable stanza after this fashion reminds one of the great personage who in pinching the nose of the dead alexander to give it seemliness found it crumble to dust under the touch on another occasion the doctor pronounces a line in another mediaeval rhyme to be a superb line it consists of the words  vale immunde munde the critic would therefore find beauty in ciceros alleged attempt at poetry oh fortunatam natam me consule romam would find much to extol in the epitaph on rosamund  rosa mundi non rosa munda and be ecstatic over the wellknown riddling fines on proculus who was killed by the bell of the church of st proculus falling on him on his grave in the churchyard these lines were to be seen perhaps  si procul a proculo proculi campana fuirset ip8e foret proculus nunc procul a proculo while the doctor displays as above his taste for poetry steenburger thus illustrates his philosophy    strange isnt it that so many men are known who ought to be unknown and so many are unknown that one would give all his old boots to know  it is not however the philosophy or the reflections in this volume which will attract general readers so much as the experiences of fishing and shooting which are told with the best effect for example  it is safe to be always ready to lose a fish nor have i ever known a more remarkable loss than occurred to me still later on that day frank had followed down the bank of the river and i had twice given him my full basket to empty after the second emptying the first tish which i took i put in it a threequarter pounder and standing on a fallen tree six feet above the stream cast below over a deep hole and as i cast saw this fishs head coming out of the receiving hole in the top of the basket before my left hand could reach him a flap of his tail sent him like a shot into the air before my eyes and he vanished in the pool below me john said i after that i am going home a solitary fish standing up on his tail and putting his head out of the hole in a twelvepound creel is a wonderful sight and means something let us be superstitious for once and stop work there must be compensation for losing a fish in shooting a deer under discouraging circumstances  i used to think that a deer was one of the most foolish of animals for he will even stand and look steadily at a man as long as the man is motionless but almost at the wink of an eye surely at the slightest movement of a head or hand he is away imagine the scene as we moved across the lake in the gloaming for it was past sunset of a rainy evening and tell me if that buck was not exceedingly stupid for an animal supposed to be timid beyond all others i was in the extreme bow a white statue i folded my arms cautiously at the start to cover even my hands john and the boat were out of sight behind me and the paddle was invisible and noiseless as we shot across the lake he was feeding on the grass on the edge of the water standing broadside to us with his head down at fifty rods distance he raised his head and saw us stretching up his long neck and turning his head full at us he stared in astonishment at first curiosity next satisfaction at last for the paddle had stopped and he only looked at a motionless white mass which resembled nothing he ever saw before as soon as he began to feed again we advanced swiftly some fifteen or twenty rods when he lifted his head again and again seemed lost in wonderment we were not more than thirty rods off and as he looked at me i looked at him for full two minutes but though i could see his eyes he clearly failed to see mine if he had ever been in the vatican gallery he would have recognised the queer object before him it resembled nothing so much as a herculean torso without arms of old marble a little yellowed by earth and age certainly he had never before seen a man in a white rubber coat for at length he went to feeding again now john sent his paddle into the water ten or a dozen sharp strokes and up went the head again to look at us but the bow of the boat swerved just enough to let john shoot over my left and at the instant the rifle cracked down went the buck dead at the fall i never saw a deer fall more suddenly after that i advised sportsmen to paddle up to deer with white rubber coats on we give one example of the many legends narrated in the book most of which show much power of memory perhaps also of imagination on the part of the narrator   i once asked a learned mohammedan in egypt whether he believed that women would go to heaven for it is an error to think that houries are mere women and what he thought of the prophets saying that there are no old women there he replied giving what is i believe the orthodox creed of islam that women will be saved like men and will all be made young againexcept one woman and her story is somewhat interesting when joseph wa3 viceroy in egypt he was riding out one day near memphis and an old woman seizing him by the knee demanded charity he turned to look at her and was so shocked at her appearance that he involuntarily exclaimed how terribly homely you are then why dont you pray to your god who answers all your prayers and ask him to make me beautiful  whereupon joseph lifted up his hands and prayed for her and instantly beheld her standing by him young and lovely so lovely that he loved her and made her his wife and she grew old and died long after him and went to heaven and is an old woman there and the only old woman in heaven for god makes all good women young again once but only once and she can never be made young again an egyptian village perpetuates in its name badrashain the story of this wife of joseph we are a little inclined to ascribe this story to the prolific author known as ben trovato and we are disposed to ask if  badrashain is not a corrupt form of the irish word bathershin however this may be the book taken altogether is a good book for an occasional halfhours reading in this way it may be perused with pleasure to the end it is to be praised too for its frankness at whatever cost mr prime not only declares that he loves to go afishing but confesses that he is not troubled with the thought of what the fish may think or feel about it if the fish is in pain so much the worse for the fish on the other hand there is a certain lady whose horse he would ride through flames to the killing of the steed and with safety to the rider rather than that certain lady should feel a single pain  fish were made to feel but if a certain lady be not exempted why then there is something wrong in creation,orthamerica

is substantially the old drumtochty onewith however lachlan campbell and donald menzies left out of the action of the piece though evidently looking on lovingly at the wings and ready as wellcoached understudies to rush in and do their best should hillocks or burnbrae or the redoubtable drumsheugh himself break down but the new play is essentially lay and mundane there are in it no seventh heaven raptures transfigurations or sermontastings a second reading of the book has left me in doubt as to whether there is any free kirk or any dissent worth speaking of in drumtochty there is burnbrae to be sure who would rather leave his farm than be disloyal to his disruption creed but even burnbrae   the days of old lang syne by ian macaren london llomer and stoughton 1895 is a man of strong common

in  the days of old lang syne  we have the parish as it is six days in seven and the most of whose inhabitants are good churchmenor free churchmen as the case may bewhose  religion in common life  finds expression in silent action even more than in family worship it is perhaps because drumtochty in its weekday clothes is more difficult of adequate portraiture than drumtochty in its sunday best that i consider ian maclarens new book a distinct advance on its predecessor i think the transfiguration of donald menzies in  beside the bonnie brier bush  trembles on the verge of unreality and that the holder of the macwhammel scholarship would have been truer to life not to speak of conscience had he preached his new learning sermon semitic environment and allrather than have acted in the possibly beautiful and certainly carlylean way he did even although he thereby pleased his aunt and the spirit of his mother here i find no unrealityalthough there is abundance of what mr arnold in his ignorance of the depths of scottish nature termed  intolerable pathos not even in the little tragedy of the servantgirl who went to london or in the loves of the close drumsheugh and the nippytongued jamie soutar and this makes me hasten to say that while there is almost no spirituality there is a great deal of emotion in  the days of old lang syne that emotion overflows its banks as often as the tochty as a matter of fact ian maclaren while obviouslynever more obviously than in his new booka humourist by nature is a sentimentalist by mission that is to say he has set himself deliberately to lay bare the recesses of simple scottish tenderness and love to oppose these realities to the socalled realism of the rougonmacquart horrors andalas that one should have to say so of the wessex of  jude the obscure and that he has succeeded is beyond doubt in the death of lily grant in  a servant lass  the author is seen at his very bestbetter than in the death of the  lad o pairts which is to me a trifle too  exalted or in the death of maclure which is too long drawn out jamie soutar plays many parts excellently in this book but his intrusion into  a servant lass preventing it from becoming too depressingly sad is perfect ian maclaren is not always it is true up to the mark of  a servant lass drumsheughs lovesecret is too long and too elaborately sustained i for one should have preferred him to remain a consistent curmudgeon to the end instead of turning out a pilgrim of love in disguise but above all things excess of an essentially optimistic sentimentalism has induced him to make the one blunder of his new book to pen the almost maudlin last chapter ian maclaren can in most respects stand comparison with mr barrie but his oor lang hame can only be contrasted and unfavourably for its author with the return of the  son from london  in  a window in thrums which appears to have suggested it the appearance of this son in thrums as a pariah the agonies of his conscience the little touches of neighbourly kindliness which ought to temper the boycotting of him as a moral leper by his old friends but which in reality only add to its pangs his return to london presumably to make a dreary best of it with  the woman who has played the devil with his life these constitute the most awful piece of real for being moral it is real scottish tragedy that has ever been published compared with the return of jamie mcquhumpha to thrums that of chairlie grant to drumtochty to drumsheughs heart andhad that been necessaryto drumsheughs chequebook seems flat and almost poor if ian maclaren is a sentimentalist of set and almost scientific purpose he is a humourist by nature if  beside the bonnie brier bush  indicated this in unmistakable fashion  the days of old lang syne places the fact beyond all question what is more it demonstrates the variety as well as the quality of its authors humour when he keeps it free from emotion as he does entirely in a triumph of diplomacy and almost entirely in  good news from a far country and in the  nippy tongue  section of jamie soutars history he comes nearer to galt than any of his contemporaries mr barrie himself not excepted i have said that a servant lass  is ian maclarens high water mark as yet but for pure and dry but not ungenial drollery there is nothing in this volume or in its predecessor to match hillocks ingenious devices to secure the renewal of his lease on good terms or the successful efforts of the drumtochty worthies to magnify their professor in a far country who happily does not die like 1 omsie jamie soutars hits as at the cockney temperance lecturer and the too confident evangelical preacher are delicious his end is perhaps a trifle overdone

second whether or not it be true as rumour has it that ian maclaren has said goodbye to drumtochty he has in hillocks jamie soutar domsie burnbrae posty and drum sheugh at all events drumsheugh before

there is a burlychested bighearted old seadog known as captain joe whom we prefer even to the diver there is something invigorating and refreshing in the briny atmosphere which he brings with him

gentleman in his friendship with mrs leroy in fact all the characters are good the details of engineering work are interesting the style is bzight and effective the writer is to be congratulated on his work  caleb west master diver by f hopkinson smith constable  cothis is a very typical american novel of the kind which is not by one of the few firstrate writers on the other side it shows a society full of young enthusiasms always eager to resolve fresh problems and looking on life as something new requiring investigation and not yet cut and dried these characteristics are what generally make even the worst american novel worth looking at as it may suggest some original way of looking at life but these novels have also the inevitable fault of a youthful literary societys work  they have little style and little sense of proportion the author is apt to be so interested in his own ideas that he forgets to rivet his readers attention by the unity of his story now caleb west is by no means a bad novel it is full of interesting matter and it has a subtlety of observation and a delicacy in characterdrawing rarely found in any but the best english novels  but as a consecutive story it is hopeless the account of the building of the lighthouse is most interesting even exciting but it has no more real connexion with calebs love tragedy or mrs leroys fine character than the account of a gold mine or a savage raid would have mrs leroy is indeed disappointing dramatically there is just enough of her tragedy outlined to attract intensely without satisfying the reader  the suggestiveness of it is so subtle as to be elusive nevertheless  caleb west is an interesting book and if the author would study form more he could write excellent novels  caleb west master diver by f

sympathies from the first when it is declared that  at fifteen she was not a precxious hoyden with untitly hair and a flippant tongue neither wa she an adept in any of the newfangled modes of flirtation thc chicf of which is that the woman kindly takes all the trouble of thc courtship off the hands of the man it must however be pxinted out that the  cometh up as a flower  and  comin thro

forgery disappearing for a few years only to retuirn when his presence will create the greatest embarrass mnent by the process of misunderstanding so well known to fiction the somewhat dilatory lover

author again deals a sideblow at prevalent heresies in art and manners lora roland in the sweet freshness of her youth with brilliant beauty of face and unstudied grace of form was a living protest against the bold attempts now being made to thrust repulsive ugliness upon us as the highest form of art would these latter lay sjoilers and libellers of the divine gift of beauty have dared to tell any man that to make dora really lovely all her brilliant colouring should be washed away that the beaming eyes should become lustreless and full of unutterable woe and the soft outlines of her form lean lank and haggard as if the fresh pure air of heaven had never been breathed into the cramped lungs or nourishing food tasted by the pallid lips but happily in spite of paint and powder horrible cosmetics and abominable hair dyes in spite of the lath and plaster so liberally used to hide the deficiencies of nature and in spite of the new crusade preached by a few fanatics against the beauty of youth and health and vivid coloring we have still amongst us some lovely women dora roland is a takig ceature natural inn t fascinating not so cold and calculating as to be placed bod the

autumn close at handteforc dreary winter sets in there is st martins summer the sweetest season of the year in this bare outline we have made no mention of the numerous secondary characters who agreeably fill the pages of the story the episode of louise courtenay the young lady of advanced opinions who tried hard to be a strongminded woman but was ignominiously converted to a more commonplace destiny is decidedly amusing and welltold it must however be objected that both social and artistic theories are considerably antedated that it is not the cant of fiveandtwenty years ago which is aptly signalised in the title of a jamphlet on the manysidedness of the moral idea in connexion with the gymnastics and music of ancient greece or the taste of that epoch which was characterised by black ceilings greygreen dados and fifteenth century chairs and tables it is a pity that those chapters are not transplanted to the latter portion of the book where they might figure with more verisimilitude it may also be noted that mr ruthven could hardly have come to w as the  bishops curate  and that although the notion of an archdeacon whispering soft nothings in a curly hat and gaiters is entertaining enough it must be looked upon as rather a glaring abuse of episcopal patronage when wsc find this dignitary a goodlooking young man with dark curling hair to be the bishops eldest son he is evidently an archdeacon unattached for we discover that his spiritual functions arc exercised at a fashionable proprietary chapel in london where exquisite masses are sung morning and erjixg under the presidency of the seductive archdeacon who acts as impresarso to this attractive sunday popular i we are aware that something of the kind is to be found in london but unless we are greatly mistaken the presiding clergyman derives his ecclesiastical style from a former colonial appointment and we believe he is now at liberty to indulge his errtic tastes as a freelancethese not being altogether ape proved by oldfashioned authorities st martins summer needs a few minor corrections but it is written in a fresh and pesant style and is really worth reading  i st affartins summer by shirley smith hurst and blackett 3 vols if the criminal jurisprudence novel just noticed presents almost the exaggeration of compactness in construction shirley smith supplies a contrast almost grotesque in its completeness in her first volume she tries back towards the heroines early youth and has her chronology so loosely arranged that we find croquet in full play in what must be at the latest the year i850 lawn tennis flourishing in 1854 and a horse christened  the claimant also in i854 these are slight slips but they are characteristic of the loosest and most piecemeal novel we have ever read the heroines fortunes are followed up for a little while and then she is shunted while a batch of advanced young ladiesattired in the artcolours and doing the crewelwork which the author loathes at least twenty years before either had come into beingare reclaimed and reformed by husbands they disappear completely on this happy consummation and the heroine is again resumed to be again shunted into a very long siding indeed while a totally new and disconnected series of love affairs occupies writer and reader the latter parts of the storyor rather the latter stories are the best they comprise an incident which resembles perhaps accidentally fanny prices return to her portsmouth home in miss austens mansfield park and which is given with a great deal of feminine

should her child die within sight of landwithin a few hours sail of her brothers home no those prayers were heard even whilst she knelt by her childs couch and seemed to await her last breath nelson who had been pacing half the weary night through upon deck came to tell her that they were sailing on the thames and would soon be in the docks 14thank god was all sho said as she burst into a flood

well drawn and deserving of attention pynsent burton the doctor brother louisa colville and two uncles are well distinguished the artist brother and tiny his artist wife are well described and naturally invested with some dramatic attributes there is however a total absence of counterinterest we deplore the absence of a villain mr michelson father of chatham is only cold and disagreeable and even he repents while mrs hicks a depredating housekeeper only becomes villainous towards the end of the story does very little beyond cheating her master and burning some letters during his illness her evil disposition causes but a temporary inconvenience and evidently did not enter into miss beales original scheme mrs hicks being at first represented as rather pleasant than otherwise the greatest fault of this novel as a work of art is the disregard of dramatic balance the story proceeds through three volumes equal in length to at least a dozen by alexandre dumas and there is no reason why it should not pro ceed for many years longer with sequels and continuations equal to those of that mighty weaver of interesting tales the story is too even and equal lt lias no rise and no fall and we should not feel surprised at the successive appearance of separate works such as 44 jessie a continuation of 44 simplicity and fascination 44annabella sequel to 44jessie chatham michelson being the second series 44 tiny and in fact a hundred other works gliding one after the other with the creamy smoothness of the one before us miss beales description of wales and her knowledge of somersetshire localities answer well to the general tenor of her work  and her apparently personal objections to our course of policy in india will meet with the hearty concurrence of many of our readers it is hardly necessary for us to tell our readers that mr brooks is a very clever man and au accomplished writer all who keep themselves au courant of the passing literature of the day know his pleasant epigrammatic style and recognise his versatile fluency in travels vaudevilles and weekly newspapers accordingly when it was known that this untiring author had a three volume novel in the press great expectations were raised among the lovers of good books for his name was full of promise we hardly like to say that the promise has not been quite fulfilled  for is not the book full of clever sayings  are not its pages pitillantes of wit  whereas ninetenths of the novels of the day are equally dull and flippant mr brooks then has written a book far superior to the general run of circulating library novels undoubtedly he has but a man of his talents is hardly likely to be satisfied with such an achievement as this we presume at least that he has the laudable ambition to fill a more prominent place in the walhalla of literature and to see his works classed with those of the few great writers of prose fiction whose tales we are almost loth to call novelsa good name in itself but dishonoured by its application to every sickly story without plot invention or character which corrupts the taste if not the morals of precocious schoolboys and lovesick milliners such a position mr brooks has hardly won for the book before us clever as it undoubtedly is with much excellent writing with considerable knowledge of the world and without ono particle of dulness still as an artistical work it has many grave blemishes and offences against taste these will prevent its taking the place in literature which a novel by mr brooks ought to take the story is very complicated a debauched spendthrift mr wilmslow with a channing wife and three pretty daughters is placed in possession of a fine estate in gloucestershire aspen court through the intervention of an attorney mr molesworth whose confidential clerk mr bernard carlyonthe hero of the bookis sent down to aspen court to superintend the installation of the family and to exercise a salutary control over mr wilmslowas ferocious a domestic tyrant and consequently as arrant a coward as ever beat his wife in seven dials mr carlyon in one of his walks in the neighbourhood rescues a young lady from some rustic robbers the young lady is lilian trevelyan the representative of the family ejected by mr molesworth to make room for the wilmslows of course mr carlyon falls in love with her  of course she reciprocates  and of course in the third volume they marry but there are plenty of difficulties to overcome in the second volume and one or two wily enemies to outgeneral or defeat the most formidable are the earl of rookbury and the reverend cyprian heywood a roman catholic priest lord rookbury is a clever unprincipled old roue very charming and very gentlemanlike very avaricious and an unblushing liar mr heywood is a catholic without faith and a jesuit who laughs at his vows he is a sort of mortal mephistopheles with a power of prescience omniscience and ubiquity more vraisemblable in a german romance or in a french melo drama than in a story purporting to describe english life and character in the reign of queen victoria the peer who for his own ends wishes to do good service to carlyon persuades mr selwyn a cabinet minister and one of the bestdrawn characters in the book to take the young man as his private secretary then come plot intrigue chicanery of ali kinds lord rookbury plots against mr heywood mr molesworth against both and all three mystify bemard who has a difficult game to play among them all the fault which we have to find with the story is that it is too intricate and perplexing and but this is the case very often in actual life that there seems no adequate cause no perceptible motive for some of the subtlest machinations of the jesuit or the most daring falsehoods of the nobleman the frequent episodical chapters and thc introduction of an undue quantity of supernumeraries to speak theatrically who have nothing whatever to do with the 44business of the book are also we consider drawbacks to the merit of 44 aspen court paul chequerbent is but a ghostly revival of mr dickenss dick swheller mr molesworths clerk is far less amusing than miss sally brasss assistant and though meant to be more gentle manly and made to associate with men of fashion he is after all but a poor snob the chapters describing his policecourt adventures and gravesend junketings with angela livingstone a transpontine actress are in the worst possible taste we are sure that if mr brooks had allowed himself time to 4weed and to revise his book he would never have sent to press such vulgar trash the supperscene at mrs foresters is still more unfit for the pages of an english novel mrs forester a warmlydescribed widow is in love with selwyn the secretary of state after the opera one saturday night she invites carlyon whom she has only once before seen to supper promising him a pleasant party no one is there however but the widow and a young protegee miss maynard  a strange young lady who in the third volume carries otf heywood the infidel priest to america whore they turn mormons ho played his part well whipped the trifle called talk with an adroit hand and finding that the slightest dash of foreign flavour was not unwelcome to the taste of mrs forester he availed himself of certain parisian recollections which if indiscreetho managed discreetly enough and which were quietly appreciated by lucy forester and it must be said still more evidently relished by mary maynard and the littlo supper being perfectly served and mrs foresters wine being so exquisite that carlyon wondered who could attend to it for her the party became exceedingly radiant as the sabbath came in mrs forester lay back in her delightful chair and resting her classic head upon a soft little cushion listened with the most charming smile and retorted without taking the trouble to move her eyes from the lamp while that strange mary maynard under some pretence or other had curled herself up in a corner of the couch on which bernard was and sat in a sort of oriental attitude which had many advantages not the least being that it enabled carlyon to observe that her foot was exceedingly pretty      44 take care of him mary said she in a curious tone as she left the room as the door closed bernard turned to his attractive companion and found she was gazing wistfully at him with something like preparations for a cry what hard creatures men are his thoughts immediately recurred to the wineglass  i know you think me very strange said she after a pause which he had hardly known how to break and the symptoms of an outbreak became more and more evident but she struggled with her impulse for a moment dont make a commonplace civil answer she said4 or i shall have no patience with you i know your thoughts you are sitting there despising me as hard as you can dont tell me   a phrase which the young lady seemed to affect  presently you will go away and as you light your cigar in the street you will smile and sny4 queer girl thatsomething wrong and tomorrow you will sit down and write to miss and tell your dearest love that you went out to supper and met the oddest sort of girl with her dress off her shoulders and black hair not altogether ugly but cracked you believe  and then you will make a sketch of me for misss amusement and assure her that she has no cause for jealousy i knowdonttellme  and she almost gasped bernard compassionately took her hand a very soft and warm one and she looked up quite piteously 44 say you will not write that in your letter said mary in the most earnest and petitioning way 44 certainly if you wish it said bernard not exactly knowing what else to say 44 o t do i do so much she replied sobbing 44 will you promise it will you pledge yourself to it there i am sure you will andand it was so evident that she meant to be kissed hy way of confirmation of the promise that there was really no appeal and though of course bernard under existing circumstances most reluctantly approached her lips he did touch them and whether she hod bent too forward in her kneeling position or however else it might happen a cloud of black curls fell upon his cheek and mary maynard into his arms he could hardly look up for a moment or so but as her curls fell back from his face he did and met another gaze which is the white hermitage young carlyon said mr heywood 4 ah this i think he added quietly filling his glass there is something in all this which reminds us painfully of eugenes sues pictures of high life in paris it is strangely unpleasing to our english taste this mrs forester thus acting a part unfit to name an unprincipled gambler the harbourer and cruel taskmistress of poor mary maynard an unscrupulous tool of the jesuit heywood afterwards employed by him in a still more disreputable work marries and without any reformation on her part the highminded pious selwyn and is chosen by bernard carlyon to present at court his pureminded wife  surely mr brooks must see the gross indelicacy of all this the man who draws such bewitching characters of women as jane wilmslow little amy and the lofty lilian cannot be utterly insensible to all the finer feelings the chapter describing the incarceration of the wilmslows girls by lord rookbury in his house at rookton woods is certainly as exciting as a chapter in monte christo but even more improbable the second title of this book is 44 a story of our own time we cannot quite believe in the existence nowadays in england of such wonderful mechanical contrivances to prevent escape to facilitate eavesdropping and to convert the drawingrooms of a countryhouse into a sensuous oriental harem as are described as part of the household furniture of the earl of rookbury such startling improbabilities not to say anachronisms greatly mar the effectiveness of the book as a description of modern manners it is more pleasing to read such a scene as this full of truth and tenderness where the two hard men of the world exchange a few words of honest sympathy and sorrow for the poor mother about to lose her darling child  441 hope nothing is seriously the matter with poor little amy 441 fear said lord rookbuiy4 that the poor child is not long for this world what amy exclaimed bernard much shocked 44that sunshiny little face he stopped to hear more 44 a cloud has como over that sunshine said the karl in a tone of real feeling  and i doubt whether a darker shadow be not approaching faster than is believed at aspen court i have seen some sad business in my time carlyon he continued 44 and there is not much that i need a physician should tell me but a physioian will have to tell a cruel story to poor dear mrs wilmslow before long 44 it will kill her said carlyon in a low voice 44 she is the best mother in the world and is devoted to all the girls but little amy she idolizes 44 and i will tell you why said lord kook bury once more speaking in the calm voice of ono who analyses a subject but without sympathy 4l that child was born just os the dream that henry wilmslow was anything but a selfish profligate came to an end amy is the link between her mothers happiness and her desolation that link is about to be broken but mrs wilmslow has too strong a sense of duty to let her heart break with sorrow carlyon listened with much surprise as lord rookbury uttered these sentences bernard had never heard him give so much proof that he coidd appreciate a womans nature or her goodness that evil old man who had walked in his reckless way over the worlds best gardens he had then sometimes owned the beauty of the flowers he had snatched and cast away more often perhaps than the younger man imagined carlyon accordingly takes down a great london doctor who having seen amy pronounces her to be dying rapidly the cowardly cur her father listening behind a curtain hears the sad statement without sorrow but with rage at his not being taken into their confidence and determined that the awful news shall not be broken gently to his poor wife rushes into the garden whither the gentlemen had gone to seek her and tells the terrible truth in his own vicious way amy had sat down upon a gardenseat then kate to bernards surprise laid her hand on his arm and made a gesture that she must speak to him apart they proceeded a few steps from the rest of the party 41 there is no time for more than one word is that a doctor and is amy dying 44 yes said bernard her hand clutched upon his arm and he felt her tremble violently but she mastered her agitation and said in a hasty and imploring voice  tell mamma you tell her for gods sakenow bernard guessed all sprang to mrs wilmslows side and made an imperative sign to rockbrook unperceived by her that he must instantly make his communication the readywitted physician understood him and without comprehending the emergency of the case offered his arm to his hostess with a request that she would permit him to say a word or two jane gentle as ever took his arm though with some surprise but they had scarcely turned from the others when a strong hand was laid upon her shoulder aud her husband stood among them he was excited by liquor but in the perfect possession of his faculties and hi face bloated by low debauchery bore a savage expression which as it seemed to carlyon at the moment would have justified him iu felliug wilmslow to the ground 44 ah  im in time i see he said as jane in her habitual effort to screen her husbands vices forced a smile and tried to frame some playful words to help him to excuse his rudeness the smile told him that she had not heard the fatal news 44 one word with you mr wilmslow said carlyon dashing in as a last chance for he saw henrys intention u i havo a message to you from lord liookbury just como and hear ita secret from the ladies 44 indeed returned wilmslow looking at him with on insolent scowl 441 ll hear it at my leisure mr soqretury carlyon sir what 1 have to say is what this gentleman says that a mother ought to hear from her husband i believe those were your words sir i was afraid that my daughter might have forestalled me 44 take her away said bernard to rockbrook 44 at your peril sir shouted wilmslow seizing his wife by the arm  i have only to inform you mrs wilmslow he said in a drawling malicious voice 44 that this gentleman is a london doctor brought down by th at gentleman to seo your youngest daughter and his report is that she is dying and cant live two months all eyes turned to seek amy who retained her seat at the foot of the old tree but the mother was the first to clasp her in her arms 441 knew it said amy quietly 441 thought you all knew it oh yes i am dying i from that day wilmslow is a doomed man molesworth and carlyon who never forgive pursue the wretch to his merited destruction the reason given for molesworth having brought about the wretched marriage between the brute wilmslow and the gentle jane tracy again reminds us of eugene sue that a man disappointed in winning for himself a woman whom he loves with the strong passions of his energetic nature should plot to consign her to the arms of a sot a villain aud a fool in order that she might never respect her husband or love him is too melodramatic a piece of absurdity for our sober english taste there is an excellent description of a debate in the house of commons from which we extract the following spirited sketch  he was hardly down whon one of the staunchest buders of the opposition stood at the red box on the other bide he confronted the ministers boldly as became the fearless and honest commoner lord of half a county and with a pedigree few lords can show lacking the practised composure of the minister he grew excited even with the game in his own hands and the broad hale face reddened up to the roots of the silver hair a fine kindly old man that county member and one who would far gladlier have led the whole house after one of his foxes than have hounded them on to tear down u minister but he thought ho saw duty and it had boen a wuy with the men of his blood for eight hundred years to do it the house rang again with his lusty old voice as he denounced the bad measure and the worse cabinet and moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months the speakers eye fell right and left with extreme impartiality now calling up an energetic barrister bent on a solicitorgeneralship and now a wealthy shipowner strong in wellapplied sense stronger in illapplied aspirates a professional orator delivered his prepared harangueit did not lit very well being un answer to what had not been said but was otherwise unexceptionable  and another gentleman primed with

accomplished debater calmest when apparently stormiest with a studied tone for every taunt and a practised gesture for every jibe his shaft missed no mark his arm struck no blow short he appealed to ancient principles to historic names to the honourable traditions of party to the proud clements of the constitution and he urged in accents alternately sonorous and bitter that for an old principle the advisers of though crown had substituted a manchestermade expediency that they read history backwards as witches read prayers and with though same desirethat of raising a destructive fiend that they had abandoned party traditions for disgraceful hucksterings and that if they had hitherto abstained from destroying thc constitution it was chiefly because they had hoped to make a better bargain

speaker was advancing to save the country he concluded one of those dashing and deadly philippics which are a feature in parliamentary history lilian is a charming heroine but bernard carlyon though least loveable of heroes we were at first puzzled to account for our repulsion to this young man he is brave generous and openhanded courteous to womenthe qualities these of a true hero some of the qualities granted but not all there is no sympathy in his character no tenderness no enthusiasm he is cold worldly and calculating we are never led to suppose that he cares for politics or party of a sudden we find him the active energetic assistant of a secretary of state to whom he has been consigned and wc cannot help thinking that he is a mere political swiss who would serve a secretary of state of the opposite party just as strenuously if his doing so would advance his prospects sceptical in all things trusting in nothing but his own hard sense and unflinching boldness his very love for lilian trevelyan savours less of tender passion than of a tierce resolve to win what such clover schemers as lord rookbury mr molesworth afterwards and for no earthly purpose discovered to be his father and mr heywood his priestlyrival are equally determined to withhold from him such a man may be very clever very successful  but he will never bo much beloved even in real life and is by no

dunbar nutt  blackfoot lodge tales the story of a prairie people by g b grinnell same publisher tne pawnee tribe ocaupied the banks of the platte river in nebraska where now stands the flourishing city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has

B4825,"['6786209', '8986863']",  young lives by richard le gallienne arrowsmith fis 7ms is mr le galliennes third novel and taken with these that preceded itthe quest of the golden girl and the romance of zion chapelit shows us clearly what ara his powers and limitations in fiction it shows us that tos the qelineation of a certain type of young man a product of the best two decades mr le gallienne has considerable gifts he young man is of the nonconformist middle dasses his home ls strict arid pious his own bent however is for poetry and gladness he is frank impulsive enthusiastic generous warmhearted intolerant of alltiiat is dull and mechanical and very tolerant of whatever is  done beautifully however it may conflict with the moral code he is an agnostic with leanings towards elaborate ritual a busy but superficial reader his gods being keats and pater a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of rossetti ana burnejones a sentimentalist he oan adore many young women at once and in rhyming  love  and  dova  and  bosom  and  blossom  he is expert if he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable but far less  lovable  and to be  lovable is his end in life that is the type of young man to whioh we refer a type whioh at this moment is common in london and in all the great towns all over the oountry and it is this young man whom mr le gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill and as we said last week in noticing another new novel every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction mr le gallienne is not a good novelist he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful he ia always the essayist astorytolling glad of an opportunity to digress but though he has little to toll in the book before us and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed the tone is bright and sunny and the characters are pretty and gay but the readers will have to be simple we fear because with the exception of the type who rings true there is a great deal of chocolatebox unreality about the story baptist ministers for example onwhose shelves is all the most exquisite literature of doubt are not really named chrysostom trotter it is largely these wilful little perversions of fact which mr le gallienne always indulges in that keep sophisticated readers from his works but for their especial benefit we take it the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher mr le gallienne here hits round him with spirit sparing not even himself we quote a passage presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hairlike a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood at the same moment there entered as if by design his very eatithesis a short firmlybuilt clerkly fellow with a head hkea billiardball in need of a shave a big brown  moustitohs aad enormous spectacles   that said

have to wait for it he would hasten it if he would cut his hair but tbat he says he will never do his hair is his battlecry aad hair too he says is a gift well he enjoys himself and loves a fight though you mightnt think it to look at him in laying young lives aside we cannot honestly say it has interested us but it is innocent and bright and young and it is written with care  young lives bv richard le gallienne bristol arrowsmith a duet with an occasional chorus by a conan doyle grant richards here is another volume of secondrate sentiment from mr richard le gallienne we cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or notat any rate it reads as if it were meant to be it describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a northern town whose home surroundings as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes were uncongenial the young manto the benefit probably of the home to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his fatherdetermined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature he gets some poems published he falls in love and he keeps up his affection for his sister but it all reads false somehow the young man is most devoted to his sister which is very right and proper and charming no doubt but he is not content with that and must needs analyse his feelings and her feelings and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of it is the same with his sweetheart angel they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments they see a rossetti picture which they admire and they call it their church and their altar they are probably not conscious hypocrites but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites who having a fine feeling think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world the sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity this book is full of that kind of sentimentality and it is bad mr conan doyles tale on the other hand certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality it is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people who make love and get married their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet but they are fine in character and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward the book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middleclass respectability which is unassuming and not discontented of the two sets of characters mr doyles characters would certainly have less to talk about than henry and angel but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting for they are genuine and they are described simply and without affectation if mr le gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable but without a suspicion of satire they are duller than the limited yet excellent crosses,orthamerica

B4355,"['8876793', '6792195']",  the sacred fount new novels by henry james methuen  co mk james narrates this story in the first person so that the experiences and reflections of the narrator appear as if they were mr jamess own in order to keep up the dramatic illusion we shall preserve mr jamess own name in describing the narrator though it must not be imagined that we regard his use of the first person singular as anything but a dramatic fiction  mr james then one summer day found himself at a london terminus on the way to a country house party which we are to believe was one of the smartest for example not only do the husbands pair off as a matter of course with other peoples wives but they do not even take the same trains as their lawful partners moreover the food and the pictures and other luxuries of a decadent civilization are all to be found of the very best at this smartly unconventional establishment poor  mr james the dramatic character evidently not being wholly at home in such a smart set is naturally somewhat impressed and rather shy at the prospect before him but he very sensibly determines to make the most of a unique occasion by going about with a mental not ebook and an inquiring disposition  and he does not lose an instant j in beginning for at the station he sees a mr long whom he had once or twice before met at the same house but who had always hitherto consistently cut him at other places this gentleman he had consequently put down as a fool but on this occasion long recognises him with some warmth and the change is so remarkable and surprising to  mr james that he immediately assumes that long has become quite intelligent and devotes his inquiring mind through the rest of the book to trying to find out how such a change has come about he has not arrived at the end of his train journey before he has elaborated a theory in collaboration with a mrs brissenden who of course is travelling down without her husband and who in the wellknown way of smart poople habitually calls this husband  poor briss the theory shadowy as it is seems to be the chief point of these pages so we shall leave anybody who is sufficiently interested to find it out for himself to find confirmation for it 44mr james has a merry time of it with all the other characters of the book he goes about button  holing all the men generally opening with my dear man to show his intimate knowledge of polite society and even the ladies of the party have an occasional my dear woman tossed to them he does not impart to any of them his theoryhe is far too subtle for thatbut he tries to lead them by the most terribly long  winded conversations into admissions of a position of which they are supremely unconscious to do them justice most of his interlocutors are supremely bored by liim and have very little scruple in telling him so  you cant be a providence and not be a bore says one of the good women plainly enough to him but if his interlocutors are bored what must his readers be  for not content with writing out all these subtly incoherent conversations at length he sometimes interrupts them for four or five pages on end to explain the portentous signification which his imagination sees in a droop of the lips or a movement of the hand the book ends up with a conversation of about one hundred pages with mrs brissenden it takes place in the drawingroom after twelve when most of the ladies have gone to bed and the servants have been squared another subtle and characteristic touch of smart society to leave the lights on as a result of this terribly improper conference in the full blaze of the electric light it appears that not only is mr jamess  theory incorrect anyhow but that it is absolutely gratuitous as the fact which it should have explained is not a fact for long turns out to be as great an ass as ever the whole book is an example of hypochondriacal subtlety run mad the characters in the book are simple stupid english people direct and comparatively uninteresting and  mr james becomes simply a bore besides being vulgar in his absurd attempt to read into them subtle conditions of soul of which they are totally incapable  fiction the sacred fount by henry james heinemann 6s had anyone but mr james written this book his admirers might well have cried  oh tis sacrilege but since mr james himself is the author what can we say but that he has in his own brilliantly tedious way with his own inimitable art and with his own occult knowledge of what the lifting of an eyebrow or the movement of a back may meansucceeded triumphantly in an elaborate satire on himselfthat is on his own obsession  everybody knows what mr jamess obsession is and after achieving the last page of this volume it is evident to us that mr james also knows with him as with the character without a name who tells the story the vision of life is an obsession to him for real excitement  there are no such adventures as the intellectual ones  in every word or action of his fellowcreatures he perceives motives that like the lines on a railway siding have no beginning and no end mr james has never carried his analysis of the daintily unimportant further than in the sacred fount and never before to our knowledge has he after incredible labour with bricks of gossamer and mortar of sunbeams blown down the dainty edifice with such a goodhumoured series of puffs the last page brings a vision of mr henry james stepping forward and saying with a profound obeisance   you perceive how prodigiously i know myself the sacred fount we may say without more ado is youth the theme of the book is the hypothesis that youth has the power to rejuvenate and vivify age but at the cost of the oozing away of the sap of youth from itself but mr james is not a believer in his own theory or only to a certain extent he turns tail he allows his speculations to be derided and the end is more smoke than fire or perhaps it would be fairer to say that he uses his hypothesis merely as a means of showing to what prodigious lengths the analytical mind can go it is as if the princess in the fairy tale from the suggestion of the presence of the pea beneath her mattress had created a market garden of flowering shrubs the pea represents the cell from which mr james as master nurseryman has produced his garden of exotics a day and an evening cover the period of the story which passes at newmarch a country house of liberal ease and delightful appurtenances there a few choice guests are gathered among them is the narrator with his passion for embroidering on things and his genius for seeing a hundred complex reasons behind a cursory remark or a chance movement the way you get hold of things says mrs brissenden sometimes she is called mrs briss  is positively uncanny it is here is an example of just how much the nameless narrator we must restrain ourselves from the temptation of identifying him with mr james sees in a glance something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to hi in at the house he had met his wife she had in 8 me way dealt with him he had beeu with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him we have not space to quote the many things this rontgenrayeyed guest saw in mrs brissendens back but we can assure the reader that a page of the book does not cover them his awakening is due to mrs brissenden she patiently refuses to play the part of a pretty fly refuses to walk into the parlour to put a pretty copingstone to his palace of gossamer instead she fires her bright artillery at him and the concussion shakes down the palace of gossamer he has been elaborating his theories at infinite length and her comments are   how can i tell please what you consider youre talking about    you see too much    you talk too much    you overestimate the penetration of others     youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build upyou build up houses of cards are we extravagant in suggesting that this is mr henry james in a grimly humorous mood turning his analytical mind on himself the skill of the story is enormous  the triumph of its artistic presentment is indisputable only mr james could have written it so much we grant willingly but since an authors power of being able to interest his reader in his story as story must depend on the temperament and predilection of the reader we will give our personal verdict by slightly modifying one of mr jamess own locutions the narrator in the pause that follows some remarks he has made to mrs brissenden thus soliloquises oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it we would saythe transposition is slight oh how intensely we didnt like having to read our way to the very end of the sacred fount if mr james hadnt so handsomely put into it all his delicate talent and thus illumined the tediousness of the story we should not only have made a wry face but yawned ourselves away to the company ofwell of john silver or captain kettle,orthamerica
B3618,['6717360'],  a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps

claim and professing only now to be preparing for the grave the lieutenant of course accedes as much for the sake of the adventure as of the plunder and receiving the necessary information starts forthwith his adventures in securing the prize constitute the staple of the tale which is full of improbabilities and presents little inducement to the reader to try the next the next however is considerably betterthe incidents are more stirring and striking leaving the impression of actual reality though of a very singular cast the scene is placed in the heart of antigua remote from other plantations where the worst passions might be indulged unchecked by the awe of a neighbourbood but the third tale takes by far the strongest hold of the feelings a young man of good family who having wasted a very considerable pros perty of his own and much of his mothers is in a moment of perplexity precipitated into an act of forgery to relieve the parent he has so deeply injured isle is sentenced to botany bay whither he is conveyed mixed up with the lowest of the human race the scene opens at sydney ihe is quickly assigned as a labourer on a farm in the interior where he finds some

was a felon and he knew nothing of the early history of his slave and cared nothing his family consisted of a sister and a niece both of them comparatively civilized the young lady especially seemned in that lonely spot one of the loveliest of human beings by degrees the youth contrives to snake some of the acconm plishments of his superior condition known to the ladies and is beginning to excite at least something like sympathy when the jealousy and vengeance of afeinale convict whose overtures to closer acquaintance he had rejected infuses some suspicion into the farmer and he in the rage of the moment loads him with abuse and accompanies it with a blow this is not to be borne the young man flies from the house and takes refuge among the bushinen with whom a few weeks before he had had an accidental encounter in a few days the gang propose to levy contributions on the farmer the youth for the sake of the ladies warns the farmer of the approaching attack a kindness which lie repays by betraying him to his associates from the indignation of these desperadoes he narrowly escapes by darting into the woods and elulding pursuit in his forlorn condition he joins a small party of the natives and again from somte misunderstanding with them he with difficulty escapes being speared afterroaming for some time in the woods exposed to a variety of perils he is suddenly arrested by a

B7319,['8703674'],  the myth of hiawatha and other oral legends mythologic and allegoric of the north ame rican indians by henry r schoolcraft lld philadelphia lippincott  co london triibner  co prof longfellow in the notes to hiawatha recognises the works of dr schoolcraft as the chief source from which his legends are taken the notoriety thus gained has moved this gentleman to reproduce with additions and in a revised form his algie researches which have been out of print for some years the peculiar opportunities which the author has enjoyed during a lengthened residence among the ojibways on an exploring expedition have not been lost he has collected a large number of the wild tales of the indians and he relates them with a simplicity which creates confidence in the accuracy of the translations made by the author and various friends named in the preface to the algie researches but not mentioned in the present work that there is a want of variety in the legends is not the fault of the author and that history and fiction are blended in them is assuredly not a circumstance peculiar to indian myths nor does it detract from their value their true interest beyond the quaint poetry which is occasionally to be traced in them is the insight which they give of indian character in them the man appears no pompous enunciator of commonplace truthsno cold abstraction of courage and enduranceas he has been represented by some novelists we see him with all his sagacity in small thingshis lack of extended vision and of the art and power of combinationhis suspicions ignorance and superstitions even hiawatha or manabozho in prose is a very different person from that hero in the poem those who have formed his acquaintance when decked in his poetical garb will be shocked to find that he is a notorious liar even among his compatriotsthat he invites his friends the birds and beasts to supper and firings their necks as they march by him at his request with their eyes shut  that he murders his hospitable friend the beaver in cold bloodand in short is hardly more respectable than his mythological brethren of greece old nohomis also in prose is said to have had a paramour in the shape of a beara strange form by the by for a lover however it might have fitly represented a married partner but while we recognise the value of these traditions as illustrations of the character of the indian they by no means possess the charm of the poetical versions during the perusal of some of them we felt to adopt the indian creed that the little servants of the great weeng the spirit of sleep were hammering at our temples in a manner that prevented our keeping our eyes open the indians admit however that these little spirits have no judgment which accounts for the sleep which occasionally overcomes them when floating above a fall or in other positions of danger and which may explain certain phenomena sometimes observed in our own churches while some are dull however others have a certain poetry of conception and strangeness of events that may amuse even after the rela j tion of the same or kindred tales by prof j longfellow but the most generally interesting portion of the book is that denominated  wild notes ofthe pibbigwun which contains some songs and small poems in the simple ideas of which though the metre and treatment are different much of the charm of the poem of hiawatha may be traced a very pretty allegory of niagara we extract an old grey man on a mountain lived he had daughters four and one and a tall bright lodge of the betula bark that glittered in the sun he lived on the very highest top for he was a hunter free where he could spy on the clearest day gleams of the distant sea 41 come out come out cried the youngest one  let us off to look at the sea  and out they ran in their gayest robes and skipped and ran with glee come su j comemi come hu  coree cia cried laughing little er  let us go to yonder deep blue sea where though breakers foam and roar and on they scampered by valley and wood hy earth und air and sky till they came to a steep where the bare rocks stoad in a precipice mountain high  inya  cried kr  heres a dreadful leap hut we are gone so far that if we flinch and return in fear nos he will cry ila  ha  now each was clad in a vesture light that floated far behind with sandals of frozen water drops and wings of painted wind ami down they plunged with a merry skip like birds that skim the plain  and  hey  they cried  let us up and try  and down the steep again  and up and down the daughters shipped like girls on u holiday and laughed outright at the sport and foam they called niagara if ye would see a light so rare where natures iu her glee go view the spot in the wide wild west hie land of the brave and free but marktheir shapes are only seen in fancys deepest play  but she plainly shows their wings and feet in the dancing sunny spray there is a selection of such verses at the end of dr schoolcrafts volume and those who are curious about the sources of the hiawatha poems will turn to them with interest,orthamerica

the english edition into two volumes the europeans  might very well have been printed in one and it is altogether too light in its workmanship to be classed among regular novels superior as it is to most of them it is in fact a daintilywritten aud wellconstructed prose comedy containing very few incidents and some of these being rather preposterous but on the whole giving a lively  sketch as he very fitly calls it of one phase of life and one aspect of character in new england the story is of an enterprising lady the daughter of american parents but born and bred in europe morgauatically married to a jetty german prince whose family is now anxious to divorce him from her amicably and of the adventures that follow from her efforts to fall in with these proposals if she can make it convenient to do so she bears the title of baroness munster and has persuaded her brother a goodnatured bohemian whose name is plain felix young and who has no other occupation than that of a strolling artist and an amiable pleasure seeker in general to go with her from her german home on a visit to their unknown kinsfolk who live somewhere near boston there we meet them in the first chapter and in the chapters that follow we arc entertained with the small confusions and complications occasioned by the arrival of these harmless bohemians in ti new england arcadia whose inmates for some time do not know what to make of them thc head of the family ibo strangers uncle is a mr wentworth a wealthy man and in every way as good as his own gold but so oppressed with the solemnity of life and its duties as to find no room for pleasure in his scheme of existence though at the same time an excellent and indulgent father to his son clifford and his daughters charlotte and gertrude

because she thinks the match would bc to her sisters spiritual welfaro and would be a very agreeable arrangement for mr brand himself gertrude wentworth is more visionary and something of an anomaly in this puritan family felix young comes as a revelation to her from the gay outside world about which she has been dreaming all her life and soon persuades her that ho is much more likely than mr brand to make her happy  there must be a thousand different ways of being dreary she says in one of her pretty naive flirtations with felix and sometimes i thinkwe make use of them all  i am trying

right to be frivolous if its ones nature no i dont care for great questions i care for pleasurefor amusement here is a bit of the last chapter in which the family is discussing whether gertrude shall be allowed to marry felix   havent you confidence in felix gertrude was frowning thero was something about her that her father and charlotte had never seen before charlotte got up and came to her as if to put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid to touch her mr wontworth however was not afraid  i have had moro confidence in felix than in you he said yes you have never had confidence in menever never i dont know why  oh sister sister murmured charlotte you have always needed advice mr wentworth declared you have had a difficult temperament 11 why do you call it difficult it might have been easy if you had allowed it you wouldnt let mo bo natural i dont know what you wanted to make of me       i havo nover seen you so passionate obsorvod mr wentworth with an air of indignation mitigated by high principles  i am sorry if i offend you said gertrude  you offend me but i dont think you are sorry  yes father she is sorry said charlotte i would even go further dear uncle felix interposed i would question whethor she really offends you how can she offend you  to this mr wontworth made no immediate answer then in a moment  she has not profited as wo hoped gertrude was very palo sho stood looking down i have told felix i would go away with him she presently said  go away sister asked charlotte awayaway to some strange country towhat do you call it turning an instant to felix  to bohemia  do you proposo to dispense with preliminaries asked mr wentworth getting up gertrude turned to hor father i tm re profited she said you wanted to form my character well my character is formedfor my age i know what i want i havo chosen i am determined to marry this gentleman what little romance there is in  the europeans  gathers round the baroness and a certain mr acton  but we will not weaken the interest of the story to its readers by detailing this especially as the real merit of the book lies chiefly in its descriptions of gertrude and felix and the matters immediately concerning them these descriptions are fresh delicate and artistic to english readers the europeans will be particularly attractive because of the graceful picture mr janies draws of a condition of society hardly possible in this country and perhaps the kindly satire with which he touches up the picture will be as intelligible to them as to the americans who know the realities of nineteenth century puritanism in its pleasantest aspects in the out of the wray suburbs of boston we may hope great things of mr james when he tries his hand at a more elaborate novel,orthamerica

B2789,['3215472'],  rew jooks the years between the years between mark a period of sixteen yearstime enough for a lyre to rust and time enough for a fire to sink but in lyre and fire the kipling of i919 is still the kipling of 1903 nay even as  the child is father of the man so this last virile volume is the legitimate progeny of  departmental ditties the  little brown baby with a pink string round its stomach born some thirtythree vears ago the little brown baby aforesaid became an infant prodigy also an elanlt terrible and quickly attaining a precocious maturity acquired a style so original and individual as hardly to need the attestation of a signature and the precocious maturity did notas is often the caselead to arrested development and early decay kipling has continued to grow and is growing still and this last volume of poems contains some of the finest and ripest work he has achieved it will not perhaps receive the enthusiastic welcome that greeted his first work but if so it will be because his work is no longer a surprise and can no longer expect to enjoy the popularity of a debutante we have said that the kipling of  the years between is still the kipling of the  departmental ditties but we have also said that kipling has grown he has grown in height and in breadth he is no longer departmental he has become national he is no longer a storyteller he has become a prophet hle has become fiercer too more earnest and sometimes more bitter formerly he had a button on his foil now the button is gone that does not make him more popular it is apt indeed to make him disliked in old days he was accused of banjoplaying now he is compared to a streetcorner revivalist to a billy sunday to a jazzband and to other similar noisy nuisances we admit that he has the vehemence of a revivalist the fervour of a billy sunday and the fury of a jazzband and yet we maintain that even in his fiercest fulminations he remains a great poet and a great artist lie may dance a wardance with the muscular violence of a zulu but he is a nordkin not a zulu his rhythms are perfect and his agility and grace are even more remarkable than his vigour he mat sometimes wield a bludgeon but there is as much music behind it as behind a conductors baton and if he ci ush a hostile skull with a nasmyth hammer in the name of hate with the same hammer lie can crack a chrysalis to liberate a butterfly his anger is always in control and his hand is always steady and his head cool however unsteady and hot his heart may be jazzbands he never emulates he does not condescend to vers libre and ragtime his metres are simple sober and unpretentious and no poet has been less affected by the ataxias of the decadents in brief he is a great artist what could be more artistic than this  they had no heart for the rally and the roar that makes the whalebath smokewhen the great blades cleave and hdlw and leave as on the racing stroke the words go like oars the oars  cleave  and  leave   the years between by rudyard kipling s wd net methuen as if we had them in our own hands that is the work of a great craftsman what could be more artistic than his noble verses to lord roberts  take the last two verses  never again the warwise face the weighed and urgent words that pleaded in the market tilaue pleaded and wtas not heardl  yet from his life a news life springs through all the hosts to comle and glory is the least of things that follow this man home the critics who compare the poet to billy sunday may not appreciate the art of these lines but the simplicity and the inevitability of the words and the quiet ease of the metre are the work of a great poet some critic of kiplingwas it richard le gallienne once affirmed that he could write poetry only in patois but the two poems from which i have quoted and several others in this volume prove that he can also write poetry in classical english very seldom does one find flaws in kiplings workmanship and only a bold bad man would venture to alter many words but still occasionally a flaw does appear most lovers of poetic art would i think agree with me that in the sixth line of  the declaration of london  panting to shame us anew  panting is out of drawing some of the lines too in  the holy war challenge comparison with  sister susies sewing shirts for soldiers and  my boy jack though evidently intended to be a lyric has no lyrical qualities whatsoever to separate kipling the poet from kipling the politician seems difficult for some people but the writer though fiercely dissenting from kiplings political views finds no difficulty at all even though he may combat the poets views he is compelled to admit that he is  a bonnie fechter and cannot deny himto quote his own magnificent phrase that extorted word of praise gasped between lunge and guard the poet is in deadly earnest and his fiery denunciations are sometimes as shining as excalibur as beautiful as the spear of st george the faith in which we stand the laws we made and guard our honour lives and land are given as reward to murder done by night to treason taught by day to folly sloth and spite and we are cast away that is biting that is bitter and it may be unbalanced and untruebut it is poetry and almost as great poetry as sir william watsons invectives in  the purple east polemical poetry is not the greatest poetry but it requires a great poet to write it well and kipling does write it well and we must praise him and yet the magnificent phrase we have already quoted finds a chink in his own armour for alas between lunge and guard  kipling has no breath to praise a foe he is too murderous and too merciless he forgets to be chivalrous were he as great a man as he is great poet we think he might be a greater poet still but kipling is not always fighting his noble poem to lord roberts the tender feeling in  my boy jack the pathos of  recantation show with what skill he can interpret and express the gentler emotions of the heart and though so far he has been mainly  e poete le prophlee et le proesseutr deiiergie des 4 71glosaxois i venture to prophesy that when autumn comes and

B729,['8771387'],  norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale

sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much

friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate

death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a

their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and

convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less

addressed first to the young millionaire youth of america but european youth with limited pocketmoney cannot chuckle very loud for some of them must certainly be included in the  unfortunate young people  who never in all their lives d received a direct ordernever at least without long and sometimes tearful explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the request and who are here warned by the tale of harvey cheyne a softreared lad taught the way he should go by hard living hard work and a ropes end it is a new  sandford and merton harveythe millionaires heir saved from drowning by a fishing schoonerwe like aswe always liked tommy dan is a still smugger harry the amount of moral advice and virtuous example which that young man gives out is appalling granted that the

and a selfrighteousness as ruinous as it was disagreeable disko troop is the mr barlow of an unphiosophical end of the centuryan admirable preceptor but one who finds his fists a shorter way than arguments to the reason of youth the story is a paan to what seems to be the strongest conviction that mr kipling holdsthe value of strict unreasoning discipline it is a conviction many share but one which harped on outside the services is dangerousto discipline it is also an eulogy of the fishermen of the grand banks of the astuteness the patience the tenacity the cool daring of their  captains

of the men the code of bauklaws the technical phrases are explained and described with a patience which alas i is not contagious if we had ever been on one of the schooners for a day no doubt it would

a mac ulb and imagination is left out here indeed though the book must be the result of much difficult learning and hard experience it has evidently no pretensions to be anything but a slight affair judged by literary standards if it incites some lads to throw off the yoke of overindulgent parents and hunger after the toils that will make them men it has hit its only mark  reviews the new kipling captains courageous by rudyard kipling macmillan  co mr kipling is flashing a new facet upon us he has become the archimandrite of technicalities  the inspired journalist who must see things from the inside it is now his passion to grasp details to understand the work of mens hands what they think and how they act in the making of things in the guise of stories he writes bluebooks upon locomotives and upon ships giving life to the inanimate parts and firm characterisation to the workmen that control them those and they number many who are following his career closely read these technical stories diligently with astonishment at his grasp of detail and admiration of his power of marshalling and vivifying commonplace incidents but to say that they are generally attractive is to say the thing that is not these technical stories need more attention than the ordinary reader of fiction cares to give there are parts of captains courageous where the mind wearies and the interest flags nevertheless it is well to persevere and those who do so will be rewarded for the workmanship is finevery fineif somewhat overlaid  mr kipling may have had either of two motives in his mind when he set himself to write this story let there be a boy he may have said to himself the son of an american multimillionaire a spoilt boy a nuisance and a cub but with the right stuff under the crust of his caddishness i will plump him down among mon honest sailormen godfearing white all through who cure whims with hard work and affectation with a ropeend through tins ordcri he shall pass and he shall come out a man or mr kipling may have mused ill tell of polyglot folk  hairy newfoundlanders howling portuguese reckless galway menwho fish in the deep sea on the grand banks of newfoundland even to the hoarseroaring virgin ill give a six months intinerary of their buxom schooners dancing dories and the hardy orews that wrest a living from the seasfor i know i know it allthe dories that are sunk by the swift liners and the auction held over the drowned sailors kit and to make the yarn palatable ill drift into it the story of a boy and the sea shall be his master and water and men together shall buffet and lick the cub into something good but the real yarn shall be the story of the men who go down to the deep sea to catch cod if the evolution of harvey cheyne the multimillionaires boy was the motive of the story it might have been told in a quarter the length captains courageous need have been no longer tuan loveo women again and again mr kipling delays the march of the story to rollick with extraneous incidentspages of themprofoundly well done but not vital more than twothirds of the book are allocated to cod to the voyaging of the were here of gloucester mass and the doings of her crew codfishing may not be your hobby but you must grip the paragraphs line by line if you would learn what technicalromantic writing is at its beet even then some passages are ill to digest this for instance   hi shouted manuel stooping to the fish and bringing one up with a finger under its gill and a finger in its eye he laid it on the edge of the pen the knifeblade glimmered with a sound of tearing and the fish slit from throat to vent with a niok on either side of the neck dropped at long jacks feet    the cods liver dropped in the basket another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying and the empty fish slid aoross to uncle salters who snorted fiercely there was another sound of tearing the baokbone flew over the bulwarks and the fish headless gutted and open splashed in the tub a landsman is quite at sea with a description like the following except perhaps the last two lines  she was running before the witd yawing frightfully her staysail let down to act as a sort of extra foresail scandalised they oall it and her foreboom guyed out over the side her bowspritcocked up like an oldfashioned frigates her jibboom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond further repair and as she hove herself forward and sat down on her broad tail she looked for all the world like a blouzy frouzy bad old woman sneering at a decent girl but an illuminative picture like this is not easily forgotten  at the first glance a silverywhite ghost rose bolt upright from the oily water and sighed a wend whistling sigh harvey started back with a shout but dan only laughed  grampus said he  beggin fer fishheads they upeend that way when theyre hungry breath on bim like the doleful tombs haint he p a horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of oil sank and the water boiled oilily mr kipling glosses nothing in his descriptions he has a genius for fixing the dramatic moment in a scene how convincing how photographic is this whale  the deep fizzed like freshly opened sodawater and cod men and whales together flung in upon the luokless bait harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of dans net but in all the wild tumult he noticed and never forgot the wicked set little ejesomething like a circus elephants eyeof a whale that drove along almost level with the water and so he said winked at bim as the reader ploughs his way through the book it becomes plainer that mr kipling is more interested in the were here and the fortunes of her crew than in the growth of the millionaires boy so great is the authors delight to find himself aboard the schooner so avid is he to spread himself over technicalities that he has somewhat neglected to express the nuances that must have gone to produce the change in harvey cheyne the miracle works all too quickly some plain speaking a blow on the nose the wave of a knotted ropeand he is a man finally the were here returns to gloucester mass and harvey telegraphs his safety to his parents who are away out at  their raw new palace  in san diego old cheyne bids him meet them in boston and the next step in the story both for the reader and in the hoary convention of fiction is that meeting between parents and an only son who was lost and is found but mr kipling delays the meeting for several pages to describe the millionaires race ngninst tim ncrops america its nniazingly well done but is it artthe art of fiction still we would not have missed that journey for a world of pedestrian novels properly constructed on the best french model thus does genius override law by making another law oonvinoing us of the legality of the act and demonstrating its fitness with a triumphant example mr kipling finds nought common on the earth he takes the common things by choice and they become distinguishedeven cod  captains courageous literature by rudyard kipling macmillan  jo the novel is tending to replace the treatise and the essay is it also going to take the place of the volume of travel and the guidebook mr kiplings latest venture ia a description of life on the cod banks of newfoundland as seen through the eyes of a youngster who has fallen overboard from an atlantic liner incidentally by the training he receives during his three months stay among the fishermen he is made a man of and saved from becoming a plutocratic cad mr kipling presses this slight and somewhat obvious moral rather unduly but the main purpose of the book as indicated by the subtitle is to describe the life of the  fullblooded banker with admirable fullness mr kipling has achieved this end and added another portion of the globe to his ever  widening empire by rights both of conquest and discovery the book is a series of studies in the psychology of them that go down to the sea in ships  a succession of portraits of the very varied crew that go to make up the contingent of a fishing schooner from manuel the portugee who takes up harvey cheyne to disko troop skipper of the schooner the reader learns to know them all no not all for there is a somewhat theatrical took on board a full negro answering to the name of macdonald who speaks gaelic and has the gift of second sight he is so improbable that he must have been drawn from life the relations of the skippers brother who is a farmer at heart and as mr kipling would say a bad one at that with a moravian preacher who had been driven mad by seeing his whole family swept away in a flood form a pathetic idyl worked out with considerable subtlety mr kipling has used a larger canvas than he has hitherto been accustomed to except in  the light that failed if his method is still episodical he shows increased mastery in posing his groups and he may yet write his novel but this is not it it is something other and more difficult in its way it might perhaps be described as a sociological study put dramatically or perhaps one might say novelistically if there were such a word now and again we have novels of this type whose aim is to describe a state of society rather than the imagined fortunes of particular individuals george eliots  middlemarch was in the main such an attempt and more recently mr zangwill has bestowed the shape of a tale on his account of the london ghetto similarly much of the work of mr barrie and his imitators is rather devoted to a dramatic presentation of a certain social state than to the novel pure and simple mr kipling himself gained his reputation by making known to us in a series of vivid sketches the warp and woof that go to make up the particoloured web of indian life it was impossible for him to do justice to the complexities of indian cultitr in a single sketch but the simpler relations of life on the bank have proved capable of being treated on one canvas and that of no groat dimensions but in the compass of two hundred pages for the rather poor illustrations take up forty pages mr kipling has managed to sketch for us both the life and the environment of a cod fisherman off the newfoundland banks one of the points of interest about a book such as this is the study of the art by which the writer makes his readers roalise the atmosphere and tone of a strange mode of life in the first place there is the difficulty of the technical terms if the writer does not use them he loses all semblance of reality if he does use them the reader will not understand them it is not mr kiplings way to avoid using technical terms experts indeed are inclined to hint that his use of them is often more according to zeal than to knowledge his pages are simply peppered with them on the present occasion and the readers for the oxford dictionary will find plenty of new material in  captains courageous at first sight they look repellent and incomprehensible enough torn from their context they would be absolutely unintelligible what for instance is the exact process meant by  dressing  down or  under  running a trawl or being  scrowged upon  what are the shape and use ofa topping lift pawlpost hogyoke gobstick muckle what particular infirmities are referred to if a man is described as a  logy  baulky or  deader

few other verbal felicities which aid in giving a local colour to mr kiplings pages yet replaced in their contexts there is scarcely a single one of these which does not become comprehensible a word or two of explanation is occasionally thrown in without any loss of dramatic force since the derelict youngster is supposed to be learning to know the ropesanother expression the literal meaning of which is brought home to the mind of the reader in a very vivid way we have nothing but admiration for the manner in which mr kipling has solved this part of his problem it says much for his skill in this regard that a careful reader can go through page after page filled with technicalities of this sort without the need of a glossary having by this means got his reader as it were actually onboard and familiarised him with his human and physical surroundings mr kipling proceeds to give the atmosphere of his picture bya series of literary seapieces which constitute the value of the book from an artistic point of view never in english prose has the sea in all its myriad aspects with its sounds and sights and odours been reproduced with such subtle skill as in these pages one could compile from them a series of thumbnail sketches as effective in their way as the river scenes of mr whistler the following catena though it by no means exhausts the number of passages that might be quoted to illustrate this quality of the book is sufficient to indicate it the low sun made the water all purple and pinkish with golden lights on the barrels of the long swells and blue and green mackerel shades in the hollows the shadow of the masts and rigging with the neverfurled ridingsail rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight and the pile of bah by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver there was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging jibboom while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn pale waves whispering and lipping one to the other up and up the focsle climbed yearning and surging and quivering and then with a clear sicklelike swoop came down into the sens he could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch and there was a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above like a volley of buckshot followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawsehole a grunt and squeal of the windlass a yaw a punt and a kick and the were here gathered herself together to repeat the motions a gentle breathing swell three furlongs from trough to barrel would quietly shoulder up a string of variously painted dories they hung for an instant a wonderful frieze against the skyline and their men pointed and hailed next moment the open mouths waving arms and bare chests disappeared while on another swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in a toy theatre  harvey being anything but dull began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wavetops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing  the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purpleblue cloudshadows  the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise  the folding and packing away of the morning mists wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors the salty glare and blaze of noon  the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead flat square miles  the chilly blackening of everything at the days end  and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight when the jibboom solemnly poked at the low stars and harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook this last passage in particular shows with what a few lines mr kipling produces his effects in many other ways as well as this he may be described as a phil may in black on white this book then may be pronounced a decided success as regards the aim which the author appears to have had before him mr kipling it would appear aspires to be the hogarth as well as the tyrteeus of the british empire and that he has in him the qualities to enable him to play the former rdle his angloindian sketches and the present book amply testify but literature is a jealous mistress and hardly allows of a divided allegiance whatever patriotism may gain from books like the present it is to be feared letters must lose,orthamerica

selfassurance her arrogance towards the male creatures who support her and her physical perfections has often been portrayed in fiction but it has been left to mrs wharton to expound her whole significance in  the custom of the countrv we are introduced to a state of society as chaotic crude and purely imitative as that of hayti or liberia but full of force and held together by a curious patriotism from this strange soil there rises like a flower undine spragg whose history is the subject of the book the daughter of a leading citizen of apex undine was engaged while yet a child to a young dentist of that city and ran away about the same time with one elmer moffatt an adventurer whom she married and divorced in a fortnight all this was no more detrimental to her maiden pride than water on a ducks back she had quite forgotten the adventure by the time her parents on a rise of fortune moved to new york to a splendid suite in the stentorian hotel she married into one of the best oldfashioned new york families not mentioning her previous marriage and divorce but the real aristocracy of her new relatives soon disgusted her attracted by the vulgar splendour of some millionaires she made decided overtures to one of them forsook her child divorced her husband but for once miscalculated the millionaire for reasons of his own declined to marry her and she retired to paris in a state of temporary disillusionment reviving presently she married a french count and in the course of time divorced him when she finally joined hands with the same elmer moffattnow a multimillionairewith whom she had eloped from apex city in her teens it is of course a monstrous record from the sentimental standpoint but mirs wharton by avoiding the least hint of sentiment and laying stress upon the sequence of environment upbringing character has made her heroine a natural and pathetic figure she succeeds in winning for a cold and selfish character the kindly sympathy which comes of understandingan achievement of which any novelist might well be proud undine spragg is always striving for the best obtainable as she conceives it it is her misfortune that her aims are all material and egotistic no sooner has she attained a social height than her minds eye discerns another yet more radiant and desirable this explains her strange inconstancy in the married state she has no scruples fails to see how any one on earth can justly blame her for discarding men who do not give her everything she wants with the readiness her father showed for abner e spragg whose  private rule of conduct was as simple as his business morality was complicated and whose lips were often  busy with a phantom toothpick had served her will at home   why havent we taught our women to take an interest in our work   inquires a cynical observer in the book simply because we dont take enough interest in them the slaving is no argument against the indifference to slave for women is part of the old american tradition lots of people give their lives for dogmas they ve ceased to believe in then again in this country the passion for making money has preceded the knowing how to spend it and the american man lavishes his fortune on his wife because he does not know what else to do with it  where does the real life of most american men lie in some womans drawingroom or in their offices  the passage is suggestive of a curious parallel between the freest of all women and circassian pets when on the last page of the book undine learned that as a woman who had been divorced she could not hope to be ambassadress in london she burst into an angry laugh and the blood flamed up into her face  i never heard of anything so insulting she cried as if the rule had been invented to humiliate her the cry rings truly of the spoilt circassian mrs whartons latest work is no mere entertaining story it is a courageous and at the same time sympathetic study of americans  notes on novels  these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser the country is japan on which mrs fraser is known to be an authority in this volume are tales of new japan all with enchanting backgrounds tokyo is a garden says for example the author in the first of them in which a city has grown up by accident and the flowers have the best of it still in the foreground is the stormy play of passions mrs fraser can handle her pen as indeed a sister of mr marion crawford should hutchinson 6s  the custom of the country by edith wharton 6s macmillan the heroine of this american tale is a muchmarried person undine spragg finally weds a man to whom as a girl she had been married clandestinely and from whom she had been separated forcibly by her parents then the second husband came on the scene marriage for him turns out to be a tragedy he commits suicide when undine deserts him a french nobleman is the ladys next husband and finally mr moffatt who is now a wealthy man mrs wvhartons irony calls this rapid mating the custom of her country but she is too fine an artist to exaggerate the point one of the notable features in her novel is the artistic restraint she has shown on two occasions she depicts the troubles inflicted by this divorcecustom upon the child but the pathos is not overdrawn again she draws with admirable skill the parents of undine people who have made money rapidly and come to new york in order to let their daughter get into society the description of mrs spraggs loneliness in the new york hotel of her pathetic isolation and helplessness is one of the best things in the story but it is written without overcolouring mrs wharton uses these scenes and situations in order to bring out the character of her heroine and the characterisation is subtle clever and convincing it is an unlovely plot nmrs wharton does not conceal the inner misery of a woman who is inferior to all the men she marries thanks to her greedy love of pleasure but no moral is drawn the story is left to tell its own warning it is this which makes it effective there is less bitterness than in  the house of mlirtlh though the situation is practically the same but the subordination of the satire to the artistic construction of the tale is equally prominent hardly any of mrs whartons recent novels displays quite such unity and penetration as this incisive study of the modern american woman of fashion  the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson 6s it was inevitable that mrs hugh fraser having made some reputation with a diplomatists wife in japan should forthwith collect some short stories and republish them as a book but it is a uttle unfair since there is no outward indication that the volume is made up of five tales and that  the custom of the country  is the title of only one of them and that not the first it is also rather a pity mrs fraser as she has shown us in her earlier work knows japan weu sympathises with its people and is we use the phrase in a compumentary sense an agreeable rattle but these qualities though they suffice for a couple of volumes of observant gossip are not enough for the building of one good short story mrs fraser to teu the truth does not play the game she breaks the rules with an insouciance which almost disarms criticism we will take an example from the titlestory we are sitting with thornton the hero on a balcony watching the father and uncle of the japanese girl whom he loves they are talking confidentially in the opposite house and thornton and we want to know what they are saying obviously thornton and we should learn no more than we can hear or see this is how mrs hugh fraser cheats at the game 44 but now rinzo san he said  wiu you not ask me why i came  44 for a good and brotherly purpose i ana sure replied the other trying to look unconcerned and filling up the teacups with a trembling hand  for a better purpose than yours was when you left us said his brother 441 come to undo the wrong you did and to offer ybu reconciliation and friendship from all the family 44 what am i to pay for such precious things kato san p  asked rinzo eying him suspiciously and stroking his cbio such an offer from such a quarter seemed more duvgnous than a threat 44 there is nothing to pay between brothers kato spoke as loftily as confucius could have done 44 there will be his hotel bill thought old rinzo but then ht was comforted fur kato evidently wanted something and was disposed to be polite about it the points we have italicised could not possibly have been observed by a stranger sitting on the balcony opposite mrs fraser must really learn the rules and stick to them for the breach that may pass in a novel is blatant in the short story further we would beg her not to use praughfas the past tense of  preach even in fun and finally we must point out that even if there were such a word as  anthrophoby an  anthrophobic woman could not denote a female who disliked men those who know nothing of the elements should not try to coin words  fiction american divorce i the custom of the country by edith wharton macmillan and co 6s a dmirers of mrs edith whartons books have no need to be told that any story bearing her name is sure to possess many remarkably good passages that the style is excellent and that the author knows well how to illustrate and adorn her theme yet in spite of all the custom of the country cannot be said to be a great success as a novel there is a purpose in the story a by no means undesirable and probably a necessary one but the reader feels that at times it very nearly overrides the story itself which in a novel is an error easy american divorce is the theme mrs wharton has chosen and undine spragg a beautiful girl of plebeian origin is the one upon whom the author has fixed to show the horribleness and evils of the diabolical system allowed by some of the american states it may be that undine is a type of woman evolved by the artificial surroundings of a debased society but it seems almost incredible that any society or any training could make even an american woman so heartless and callous a creature as undine is represented to be she is beautiful certainly but that is all she is never presented as a fascinating woman yet she has in her trainafter her first runaway marriage of a fortnights durationa man belonging to one of new yorks oldest and best families ralph marvell whose wife she becomes peter van degen the vulgar husband of ralphs cousin a young french marquis of old family her third matrimonial ventureand her girlhoods husband who eventually becomes her last the courtship period in each case is passed over very lightly it is with the married life and the break in each case that the book is concerned and these periods are admirably dealt with ralph and the french aristocrat have much in common each is guided by custom traditions and high honour in their private and public lifeobservances which the young american beauty never for a moment grasps or understands the only intuition she possesses is to further her own aggrandisement although she pathetically just misses her desired goal every time after doing her best to ruin the two families into which she marries she at last finds her level with her first husband now more than a millionaire thus the end of undines ventures is reached so far as the reader is allowed to know of them that the book has interest no one will deny and if it does nothing else it serves to show the scandalous state of the american divorce laws although mrs whartons purpose would have been better served had she presented a character in which the reader could more easily have believed,orthamerica

the attention of the court was the marshalling of the grand jury to whom the usual charge was delivered this office was assigned by the court to one of the members of the bar a young practitioner who did not fail to embellish the summary of duties which he unfolded to their view with a plentiful garniture of rhetoric notwithstanding the portentous exaggeration of the solemnity of the occasion aud thu multitudinous grave topics which were urged upon the grand inquest it seems that this quintessence of the freehold dignity was sadly puzzled to lind employment in any degree commensurate with the exaltedness of its function it is said that the jurors revolved in their minds the whole list of national grievances one party suggested the idea of presenting the established mode of electing the president of the united states as a grievance to the good people of the county another thought of a formal denunciation of the tariff a few advocated an assault upon the supreme court but all were happily brought into a harmonious concurrence in the design of presenting a madcap ragamuffin by the name of jemmy smith for disturbing the peace of a camji meeting by drinking whisky and breeding a riot within the confines of the conventicle accordingly after an hours deliberation upon these various suggestions they returned to the courtroom with a solitary bill made out in due form against jemmy and this matter constituting the sum total of their business for the term they were thereupon discharged with the thanks of the court for the able and vigilant administration of their inquisitorial duties jemmy smith had anticipated this act of authority and was now in court ready to stand his trial isle had already selected his counsel  a flowery and energetic advocate whose

his peers whilst the gentleman who conducted though case for the commonwealth was giving a narrative of jemmys delinquencies to the jury and was vituperating that worthys character in good set terms toll was to all appearance asleep upon his folded arms resting on the desk before him when the charge was fairly explained one witness was called to support it this individual was pretty much such a looking person as jemmy himself he was rather downfaced and confused in his demeanour before the court and particularly shabby in his exterior but he told a plain straightforward story enough in though main and his evidence went the full length of all the traversers imputed enormities the truth was  jemmy had certainly broke into the camp and played some strange antics considering the sanctity of the place but during all this time taliaferro hedges esq maintained his recumbent position except now and then when jemmy feeling himself pinched hy the testi mony would recline his head

B1358,"['8631744', '4980357', '9427622']",  john halifax gentleman by the author of the head of the family c 3 vols hurst ft blackettjohn halifax is an improvement on the last novel by the same author of plot there is not much but there is a design which is followed without haste and without weariness john halifax the hero is intended to be the type of a man who from the lowest depths of destitution works his way up to fortune and a position in society there are many such men more than the world ever heard ofbut john halifax cannot be accepted as the type of such he is too much idealized a boy who begins by being a farm servant until he is fourteen and who then is employed in a tanyard to fetch the skins from market might possess all the fine characteristics bestowed on john halifaxhis selfreliance his energy his integrity his passion for selfimprovementbut he would nothe could notattain the bearing and manners of a fine gentleman he could not by mere effort of selfculture attain the tone of good society the real men who have raised themselves from nothing polish as they rise and as their intercourse with persons of breeding and education extendsthat is if they have an innate refinement of their own otherwise they remain coarse and unpolished at the end as at the beginning amongst the orientals the conventional manners of the great and those of the meanest are of the same qualitya watercarrier or a donkeydriver may dine with a grand vizier without shocking any of the external punctualities but in england it is different and john halifax is made producible in a drawingroom without ever having seen any one better than himself this is the mistake of the book  the authoress has been too anxious to make her hero perfect and has by so doing thrown a fictitious rosecoloured tint over a character that could have dispensed with any such aid the story is however interesting the attachment between john halifax and his wife is beautifully painted as are the pictures of their domestic life and the growing up of the children the strife between the two brothers when they discover they are each attached to the same object is vigorously drawn and the conclusion of the book is beautiful and touching there is a blind child muriel very prettily done but she might have died earlier with advantage to the bookher part is too long drawn out the friendship between john halifax and phineas fleoher is well managed and opens a source of interest and emotion which we wonder is not oftener and more efficiently used in novels friendship has capabilities of interest quite as deep and as universal as love only it requires more knowledge to handle it nobly and adequately  fiction ai ijohn hlalifax gentleman by the author of the i s  a s head of the family c a new edition reviseu london hurst and blackett  this was miss mulochs last and best novel it obtained an immediate and deserved popularity insor much that the publishers have been tempted to give to it the rare honour of a reissue in a single volume at a small price so that all who have not vet enjoyed the reading of it may do so without borrowing it for it is one of those books which mav be put upon the shelf for permanent preservation it is not one of the novels of the season but a fiction of enduring worth  polit halilfax gentleman by the author of  the head  of the family  olive c c three vols hurst and blackett this is a very good and a very interesting novel its faults are but excesses in a certain kind of merit and arise out of full occupation of the author in the subject and a rare intensity of purpose perhaps its two chief merits maiy admit of being reckoned as a fault it is designed to trace the career from boyhood to age of a perfect man a christian gentleman and it abounds in incident both well and highly wrought but the carrying of such a hero through a lifelong series of trials and showing him in each heroical suggests impossible perfection john halifax is indeed much such a hero to his author as was thaddous of warsaw to miss porter with the one favourable szceptiou that although he is representd as a godlike man h is wi ontialwlyis not once evendirectly honoured with that this john appears first as a boy of unknown parentage fiked up out of the streets yet not without so much concesion pid to claims of blood as to leave some indication of his rwing gentle born he is picked up by a quaker tanner and obfl into friendship by the quakers crippled son phineas fletcher the same who in his old age is supposed to be the writer of this his instructive history john is a perfect servant and a perfect friend he errs once only when out of the perfection and strength of his expanding intellect and isehood and before falling in love he allows a yearning for action beyond the sphere of the tanyard in a country villge to carry him with his friend phineas to the next town to see a play but for that escapade he atones by submitting to the displeasure of his master and by obeying so well t order to see no more of his friend as not to come near him for two whole years at the end of which time he has more than redeemed his character as a youth he quells rioters by christian conduct and is the best guardian of his masters property he falls in love and is the most highmindea of lovers then he becomes a model husband then a model father and afterwards prospering in life he becomes a model master model neighbour model landowner and squire in every relation he is sorely tried apparently by every form of trial that the author could invent and by each in an exceedingly severe form but out of every trial john halifax gentleman rises sublime his later trials are all born for many years under the dispensation of a heart disease angina pectoris which is brought on by violent emotion and always at risk of life when his last troubles are over and except the one child in the churchyard all are happy his disease proves fatal and his faithful wife nestles against his corpse and dies now whatever fault there is in such a book as this arises as we have said out of the very worthiness and earnestness of its design but conceding its obvious defects we have to say that throughout it is conceived in a high spirit and written with great abilitybetter than any former work we think of its deservedly successful author there is much delicate pathos there are charming touches of nature scattered about there are many picturesmoor scenes bome scenes scenes of lovers in the beech wood or of the death of the beloved in the quiet chamberrepresented with great truth the picture of the two friends in youth the manly and strong john halifax the wealthy phineas is new in many of its features and not new only but beautiful the general tone of the novel we may show by one quotation john halifax has lost his first and dearest daughter the blind muriel shortly before whose death another daughter had been born and though the author has felt too much the pathos of muriel in her story and dwelled on it too long still for all that it is pathos john went early to the room upstairp it was very still ursula lay
