to do good to the society to  which she once belonged we doubt if any member of the connexion can possibly look on her efforts in their behalf in the light of service in her preface she intimates that if she shall be accused of attacking with false statements or false colours under shelter of the anonymous j she will publish her next edition with her name  but then she will publish also the names of all the individuals to whom her statements refer  the place and time of each circumstance and the original documents from which her story is condensed already however many of these are designated under appellations which can deceive no one taking the remotest interest in her subject surely those who read can translate elizabeth grill without any difficulty eec c the feeblenesses the follies the formalities here summed up will be questioned by no one acquainted with the inner disciplinal observances of quakerismbut they are not so exclusively the property of the sect as the authoress would have us believe singular their form may be with thesebut their essence is universal  inevitable we may add in all cases where subscription is pressed on the members of any sect as a saving grace the timid the foolish the disingenuous will always cling to misapprehend and evade ceremonials think of the abuses that crept into the monastic orders under cover of cowl and surplice consider the number of houses  divided against themselves in this enlightened england of ours at the time present by the question of the pair of candles on the protestant altar  then for illustrations ofthe  voluntary system we fear that certain sectarian periodicals if examined would disclose a depressing amount of nonsense preached and exaction submitted to yet the  lady who issues this book proceeds apparently on the assumption that the sect which she has quitted monopolises all the vulgarity greediness worldliness and inanity which disfigure the world of high professors there is scarcely a word of exception or qualificationscarcely an indication of the solid worth and sincere if narrow selfsacrifice which must also be credited to quakerism else must it long ere this have crumbled to nothing out of its own sheer rottenness the student of manners as influenced by opinions will find some quaint specimens of behaviour recorded from life in these pages to exhibit such at length to the general reader would be of small profit so peculiar are the alphabet and parlance of the society of friends so little really like those of the uncouth caricatures which have long figured as prim and angular drolls in fiction and in farce nor do the most elaborate pictures of quarterly meeting revels and yearly meeting inanities spread out by our authoress outdo in verisimilitude or quintessential humour the proceedings of dorcas fyshe and sister rumble more succinctlv recorded in hoods  quakers conversazione the grotesque examples of pulpit oratory again here gathered are not so grotesque as others which we could add yet this very form of appeal and  improvement presented itself to charles lamb in no exclusively ridiculous point of view and if he a stranger could feel toleration for a mode of address so whimsical and peculiar our selfemancipated quakeress might have pointed out the sound kernel as well as the rotten husk the following general remark however merits emphatic extract j  it is really a very difficult thing for a quaker  to be consistent with his own principles and even  the most rigid are often found swallowing them wholesale por instance the vain adorning of the person with dress jewellery and gold he considers it a sin to indulge in those things and yet in his shop he sells them he makes his money by providing for the sins of bis fellowchristians he deems it a right thing to wear a broad brim to bis hat but he has no scruple about making and selling hats of a fashionable form for his fellow christians to wear isle would not be so wicked as to dress his servant up in livery with a gold band c but in the way of business he will do it for another if the  peculiarities are essential to the salvation of a quakerarc they not also essential for all christians can it be that friends sell and deal in those forbidden thing because they think the people ofthe worldhave no chance of salvation at all and that therefore it signifies but little what they indulge in so that friends profit by it in the above passage is stated the cardinal difficulty of the society wherein lie the seeds of its decay such nonconformity as its statutes of discipline profess is not merely at variance with every rule of nature and common sense but if honestly carried out is totally incompatible with the simplest transactions of life the really consistent quaker who declines wearing primary colours because there is a snare in scarlet is the elder there was such a man  who was made uneasy in his mind by the sight of red clover he can be neither a haberdasher nor an upholsterer nor a toymaker nor a seller of fancy goodshardly an innkeeper or a chaise proprietor his rule is stricter than that of the strictest monastic asceticism without the monastery walls to shut him away from the vain world and the religious ceremonies to supply that want which knocks loud at the heart of every human creature who has been born with an iota of imagination the quakers rule is untenable whence subterfuge compromise evasion unsettlement of mindpushed to its extremitywe will quote an instance which is amusing in itself and amusingly related the lady had married and removed to bristol  soon after becoming a housekeeper i was called on by the tithe collector friends annually sum up the amount of all they have lost by this suffering as they call it and i was then under the idea that our noble testimony against an hireling ministry was an essential part of all true christianity and that our refusal to pay the unholy tax was an acceptable martyrdom in a small way i had heard much preaching on the subject and very much selflaudation on the faithfulness of the society gene rally indeed universally to this our testimony which so widely separated us from the hirelings of all other creeds the two men who called on me for the purpose of collecting the disputed impost were exceedingly gentle and polite they saw at a glance that i was an ignoramus and kindly volunteered to inform me how other quakers managed for i had told them that my profession would not allow me to pay tithes and that if they insisted on forcibly taking away my property though i would not resist still i would look on it as actual robberydid you ever pay tithes maam  said one of the men  never i replied well then said he you are a stranger here i see and ill just tell you how the bristol quakers manage for i am going about among them for twenty years past and i am always glad to accommodate them and meet their scruples the sum you must pay is one guinea so i will call here tomorrow at eleven oclock in the morning and you just leave on the sideboard there some articles of plateyour teapot will do very well or spoons or whatever you likethen i come and take it away you dont give it and so your conscience is clear you will then return to your meetingpeople that your teapot worth ten guineas was distrained for tithe and as soon after as you like you can go to mr jones the silversmith and tell him how you lost your teapot and are obliged to buy a new one he will condole with you and after showing you a variety of new ones to select from he will hand you your own identical article and say he can sell you that cheapsay one guinea you pay your guinea and get your own safe back again cleaner and brighter than ever and if you like you can purchase some other little trifling article for mr jones is a very accommodating man1i was teally shocked at the cool proposal of so nefarious and j unprincipled a transaction and indignantly rejected  it declaring at the same time my firm belief that no quaker would be guilty of so undignified and false an act the man smiled and said  aye that is the way they all go on at first but maam it is a gteat deal the easiest and best plan in the end and then he gave nie the names of very many my own acquaintances who regularly once a year as he jocularly said allowed mr jones to clean their plate  there is old mr r said he  has a fine massive silver teapot it is always laid out ready for me i always give notice before i go and now twenty times i have carried it off and got it brightened for him he values it at twenty pounds and his tithe is only one pound ten and there is young mr r isle likes mc to get his spoons done for him isle gives so many dinners he likes to have them bright and newlooking seeing me still very incredulous he said well maam i wont call on you for a week to give you time to think about the matter during that week i went to old mr rs and told his daughter that tithes had been demanded of me but that i had not paid them and was expecting another visit from the collectoroh yes said she  this is just the time they go about they seized a valuable silver teapot from us last week my father values it at twenty guineas and the demand in money is only about thirty shillings but it is a noble testimony we are calied on to bear and i trust our faithfulness will yet be the means of opening the eyes of professing christians to the nature of a pure free gospel ministry i trust my young friend thou wilt be faithfulshe spoke so seriously that i hesitated to say what i intended about joness shop lest the idea that i for a moment could think her or her father capable of such a deed might offend i then called on young mrs r and mentioned the same thing to herthey did indeed said she take our spoons but my william has some way or other to get them back i cant tell how he manages but i suppose they are ashamed of taking so much over their demand and so return them at any rate they are sent back beautifully polished and not only that but a handsome sugarspoon with our crest engraved on it was also amongst them i suppose they were sorry and put in the spoon by way of atonement i suspected that my friend william might know more than his wife on the subject but said nothing i then went to joness shop and boldly asked if they would return me articles of plate which might be distrained for tithe on paying the exact amount of tithe demanded and was politely infoimed that they would be most happy to do soto enter into the same arrangement with me ns with other quakers but said i what recompense will you require for affording me so great an accommodation  none whatever replied the shopkeeper  the friends are very good customers of ours we are always glad to see them entering our doors and what must i pay the collectorsthey make no charge either you can give them an odd shilling now and then if you like for they are very honest civil fellowsfaithful to their appointment at the end of the week the men came to me walked straight jpto the parlour and over to the sideboard and looked disappointed not to find the plate ready laid out for them i told them i had to apologise for doubting their veracity i had inquired and found that their statement was true but as i could not see any sense in such a roundabout way of paying i thought it simplar and came to the same thing in the end to pay the money at once which i did there is no denying the cleverness of these sketchesand we are tempted to take another examplebut merely forthe amusement of our readers the species of intrigue which it records is well known beyond the bounds of quakerism only it takes here pleasant colours from the quaint and peculiar modes of life in which it is acted  i was one evening nt a large tea party introduced to a very beautiful young bride she had a large figure well and most gracefully formed the roseate hue of her cheek and the soft brilliancy of her downcast eyes were only equalled in beauty by the exquisitely fair neck and the rich dark brown hair banded in the smoothest madonna style on her lofty brow her dress was of the richest dovecoloured satin and ber quaker cap and neckhandkerchief folded in neat plaits across her bosom were of indias most costly muslin the handkerchief was attached to the dress by a gold pin with a pearl head and the belt of her dress was fastened in front by two more gold pins each with a diamond head the bridegroom was a very small thin awkward illmade man his facefrom which every morsel of whisker had been shaved offwas white flat and meaningless and his dress though quite new was badly made and badly put on it was however a strictly quaker costume in the course of the evening i said to the lady who had introduced me however did that meanlooking little man manage to get such a very lovely bride she smiled and answered  strange as it may seem i assure thee it was rachel who courted him not he her i will tell thee the story about four years ago rachels younger sister was married and she was somewhat annoyed that she the elder and so much the handsomer should have been passed by so she resolved to provide herself with a husband and thou knowest when a woman makes up her mind to do a thing she triymphs over every obstacle rachels first step was to draw out a list of the names of the eligible young men opposite to each name she placed the amount of his annual income as correctly as she could ascertain it the most wealthy was placed at the top of the list and so on in regular gradation she had twelve names dosvn they lived in all parts of england  one in london one in york one in bristol and so on sylvnnus otway was at the head of the list she had never seen him and he lived near norwich he was down for seven thousand a year rachel seriously informed her father and mother that she had  a concern to attend the norwich quarterly meeting they had no acquaintances they cared for there and were disinclined to take so long a journey but rachel became so silent nnd sad and po often told them she was burdened with the weight of her concern to go that they at length yielded to her wishes and father nnd mother rachel and her sister susanna and one of the brothers all went to norwich as the father and mother are acknowledged ministers of course they were taken much notice of and invited to all the friends houses amongst others to friend otways and rachel soon had the pleasure of being introduced to sylvanus she was delighted to find him a fine handsome intelligentlooking young man and to perceive that he was decidedly i fascinated with his new acquaintances and when at parting he whispered to her sister loud enough fa rachel to hear i hope soon to be in your city into have the pleasure of calling at your house  cheek flushed with triumph and her heart palpitated with joy at the success of her scheme sylvans soon followed them as he had promised and propogd for susanna he was promptly accepted andtw were married as speedily as the rules of our society would permit rachel was exceedingly vexed and disappointed but she is not a person to be dacomfited by one failure so she resolved to try again hit she has never been friendly with susanna sincehe next on her list was josiah gumble of york and his income was six thousand again she informed her father that she felt it was required of her to attend the york quarterly meeting and she added  it had been born in on her mind that the ministry of her beloved father at that solemn assembly would be blessed to some waiting minds there is nothing pleases our ministers more than flattery of their preaching gifts rachel is an adept at it i hare often found it difficult to keep my features in sober decorum when i have heard her speaking of the inward peace she had felt from the acceptable servite of her much valued friends and then she preaes the hand of the minister she is flattering with io much feeling as she says but they like it and rachel has her own ends in view she went to york and soon obtained the desired introduction to josiah gumble he too was young and passably welllooking rachel contrived to be very much in his company  but she saw clearly that he could not be caught she told me she had never met any man who was so coldly insensible to beauty and so stupidly indifferent to flattery however rachel was not dheartened for it soon came out that josiah wai the victim of an unrighteous attachment to the daughter of a clergyman for love of whom he deserted our israel and is nowalas that it should be sowith his six thousand a year gone over to the camp ofthe alien the thud on rachels list was john jones of londonher bridegroom now he is worth about two thousand a year and as thou must see no beauty when rachel first saw him she was half inclined to leave him for somebody else but the next on her list is only six hundred a year the sacrifice was too great and besides james lewis might be as meanlooking so she resolved on the conquest of john jones it was very easily accomplished he made no resistance he at once became the worshipper of her beauty and now that they are married i think it will be her own fault if she is not happy he is not very wise but lie is goodhumoured and goodnatured  how did thou become acquainted with this amusing story  said i  is it not a breach of confidence to tell itno indeed she replied  there were more than a dozen of us in the room when she told it herself and showed us the list she said she did not want it now so she gave it to martha elton and bade her give a copy of it to any of the girls who would like to try the same plan of getting settled in life here is an anecdote of the regency which will be new to many of our readers  i was shown in the womens meetingroom the seat on which his majesty king george iv when prince regent had for a moment placed himself when led by the spirit of adventure and as my informant stated a most unbecoming curiosity he had disguised as a woman friend made his way into the secret conclave his dress was all right a grey silk gown a brown cloth shawl a little white silk handkerchief with hemmed edge round his neck and a very wellpoked friends bonnet with the neatly crimped border of his clear muslin cap tied under the chin completed the disguise in which he might have escaped detection very well were it not for the telltale boots and the unfeminine position in which the arms and legs bestowed themselves the young woman who sat behind him and saw the heel protruding from its silken robe slipt quietly out of meeting and gave the alarm two men friends were speedily summoned and the royal intruder felt himself gently tapped on the shoulder and requested to walk into another room he made no resistance but quietly went away and receiving the usual notice that the rules of the society would not allow any but members to be

his sentence will permit and become his wife beginning with him a new life in a new world as reuben is still very young there is a fair prospect of years before him in the main subject of the story in the discovery of his father and in the final destiny of the hero the reader will be reminded of sir bulwer lyttons paul clifford the management of the story is however altogether different from that novel but in both cases we would warn romantic readers against expecting to find reuben poleworthy and paul clifford in the general run of even penitent thieves,war_contra

B5186,['9435559'],  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering

demon of the story she is madly in love with dering georgie has a narrow escape from the pranks of a vicious horse which she has wilfully insisted on mounting maurice dering saves her there is a capital description of the  race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief

herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lovely face the lovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or

B7473,"['3297121', '3213403', '2438951']",  the quest of ledgar dunstanw m1r sheppard has followed up  the rise of ledgar dunstan  by a sequel and sequels are challenging things those who read the previous story will be prepared to find that this begins with a honeymoon and ends with one the hero obviously married the wrong woman and he was not long in finding out his mistake mlary used awfully too often and when a husband on his honeymoon begins to calculate that if he and she live for twenty years she will have dinned his ears with that word nearly three hundred thousand times when he an author learns from his beloved that george washington discovered america that tennson wrote in memorandum and that dr johnson was hare ben the elements of a social tragedy are not far away especially when the young lady discovers her affinity with a young american art student who boxes better than her husband so mlary deserts him and dunstan is left stranded he attempts to exchange personalities with a wretched creature u ho commits suicide in his lodgings at paris then he marries winnie his soulmate and the book ends with some piomise of happiness for both mr sheppard again makes play with the psychology of lunatics this time with the confessions of a being who believes he is antichrist incarnate there are a number of clever and penetrating things in the book but it is not particularly artistic in form the account of dunstan in paris smacks of balzac and the story of the heros conversion it conversion it can be called in a nonconformist london chapel has echoes also though it is skilfully managed but the rambling chaotic philosophy which is spread over the middle part of the book does not hold the reader who hurries on to catch mr sheppard observing life and drawing character both of which he can do briskly when he forgets to be rearranging the universe we should have liked for example to have had more about mary who develops wonderfully after she leaves dunstan winnie does not compensate for her predecessor the book closes with her listening to dunstan reading balzac after tea on the day they had been married and remarking oh ledgar the world is so kind  it is soothing in these days of strife to hear such a note struck but it is not heroic even though winnie lit a cigarette before she sat down on a hassock to listen to the story it is in analysis and imaginative power particularly on the side of the religious temperament that mr sheppard is strong his second story of dunstan so far confirms the impression made by the first there is less humour perhaps in the sequel than in its predecessor but one odd fact is mentioned which may be new to some readers the ruthless mary asked her husband to put his hands on the table and clasp one over the other interlocking the fingers it seems that if you close the left hand over the right you are a weak person mary herself always put the right over the lelt jaames moffatt  the rise of ledgar dunstan this is a long book but it only leaves the hero on the evening of his marriage and we are informed that a sequel entitled  the quest of ledgar dunstan  is to follow a reviewer is neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet but he predicts that the sequel will have something to do with the present war meantime ledgar dunstan is set before us from childhood onwards it is a novel on the arnold bennett plan describing the rise of the hero from an ugly nonconformist household into comparative prosperity his literary and social interests his opinions on life in general his failure to win the heart of one girl and his marriage to another mr sheppard writes with some sense of humour he tells a story well though not always very accurately he has a vivid eye for the cruelty and mystery of life as a young man sees it he piles episode on episode hurries over some as for example the schooldays elaborates others inartistically as for example the visit to the lunatic asylum but invariably he is interested in the world of men and things and he manages to convey this interest to his readers it is like a first book the author has not learned to select and reject one thing after another is thrown in page after page of opinions on art religion and society but these faults of construction are carried off by the abounding vitality of the writer and if he learns to prune his words and ideas in the sequel isle will achieve a real success as it is lie has written a book that is often delightful and more than once penetrating in its criticism of life it shows force and freshness of thought and a power of expression which gives good promise of more mature work to come when the author realises that people dont quote poetry at length in conversation and that it is a mistake to fill pages with abstract discussions upon philosophy and art in the form of monologues the clue or one of the clues to ledgar dunstans character is suggested in the description of his iit to the theatre ndl

of the coupleti strike     the sentinel who is to play a lively tune for a woman a slow tune for a man playing both as a imonk enters and here is part of the tragedy of ledgars temlperanment both tunes played when he wvas born  in this volume the tragedy is still undeveloped but there is a hint of it we do not feel that the handsome aristocratic mary beltinge has won his heart he is not soundly in love with her and indeed it looks as if he could not abandon himself to the lovepassion truly still mir sheppard only suggests this he has plenty to do in this volume with unbaring dunstans crude eager puzzled outlook upon life and he rightly brings out the humour rather than the complication and troubles of such a temperament as his hero was possessed of one of his friends who had theories about education proposed to hang up in every nursery a card with this motto you are upside down everything in the wvorld is upside down learn to stand on your head dunstan is busy through this book in discovering the truth of that motto it amuses him annoys him and helps to stimulate him mir sheppard does manage to make all this interesting to his readers and the novel is a distinct success of its kind there is stuff in it to make the reader think as well as laugh ji a  the rise of ledgar dunstan by a t sheppard duckworth 6s here is an amazing novel which in construction and matter is daring and original mr sheppard owes nothing to anybody he is as a man who has spent his lifetime in the observation of life he has set himself out to give a detailed account of ledgar dunstan there is little left unsaid but however trivial the incidents recorded when heaped up they give us a monumental picture of a man dunstan is the son of baptist tradespeople and his evolution is minutely described until the time he is a successful novelist and weds mary beltinge there the tale ends with the intimation that it will be followed by another of which the war and antichrist are the themes for that book the present reviewer is longing,war_contra

effected byandbye john once more turned his thoughts towards matrimony for himself  that john butly should feel disposed to marry again does not seem so extraordinary john had married youngwas a young fatherand as he truly said the relative ages of himself and helen had in some degree alleviated the grief which he felt for the loss of her mother by placing her in the position of mistress of his

dangling at fiftyfour as miuch as he did when he was less than half that age and it is astonishing perhaps not because the case is so common that a habit of that sort does not wear off with time as might be expecled the man of fiftyfour flirts and is not ill received but he does not appre ciate the mode of his reception he does not feel himself much older than he was fiveandtwenty years before he scarcely aees an alteration in his own persion all that be wonders at is the extraordinary flippancy and forwardness of boys of liveundtwenty forgetting that when he was of that age he considered an old fellow of fifty four a  regular nuisance wonderful however have been the changes in society within the last half century  the march and influence of age have been neutralised to an extent which

such a cruel coquette that he breaks their engagement and allows himself to be married to nesta who is dying for love of him and who compels an excellent lord mowbray to whom she is all but betrothed to give her up and to fetch this most fascinating of morgans to her feet the above is the merest outline of some among the improbabilities of the prologue the details are in keeping there is a divine

out beyond the other ships just the thought ones the boat and the feeling and not a soul beside did they ever come back or were they drowned and was the unfortunate little sister whose black velvet frock they had torn up for flag left to tell this sequel to their previous mysterious adventures  or were these children capable mariners t1 whom the manipulation of a sailing boat on the open sea was a simple business and did they after a pleasant jaunt come home to an ample tea the answer can at the best only be guesswork both in  the thoughts ones  and  the balance the central idea is too obscure to be easily comprehensible  fiction shadowy psychology the roman road by zack constable cs there was a time when zack seemed set upon a kind of hard realism in two of the three stories which make up this volume she has abandoned realism for psychology lt is a curious and rather unsatisfactory psychology neither objective nor subjective but mingling both to make an impression strong indeed but without much real human appeal only one character in  the roman road  is alive and that is a minor character the others stand for types evolved rather than studied detached from rather than linked to life we do feel the actuality of the miserable village which makes a sinister background to the story but we can get no grip of the mother and the two sons who hold its destiny nor of the girl who ia so mechanically employed for the purposes of contrast and a reasonably happy ending the mother with her scruples of conscience and her angina pectoris does not move us neither does the favourite son who at first elects to keep his brother out of his own these people are good enough ideasthey have been used in fiction scores of times and will be used scores of times againbut the author does not carry us with her her comments are on too high a note when roland is considering his position we read he looked across the wall towards the rotting village and wished that though foul thing would get swallowed up by the foul marsh into which it gaped it imaged forth a very smallpox of dishonour and contact with it set thc soul itching to scratch out her own beauty that is overdone almost strident and certainly strained in expression the passage might have fallen into place if the man roland lived for us but he does not he exists indeed merely as a stalkinghorse for clever and often bitter comment much of the work in the story is technically excellent and it is charged with the writers personality but as art related to life it fails the second story called  the balance is even more remote frankly treated as allegory it would have been more effective richard eastone of the unhappy stained victorious writer types dear to fictionis again merely an idea once he touches us in his nursing of the dying child but even there the borders of true sentiment are almost overpassed the child is as unreal as dickenss sick children in his worst moods and just where some touch of realism might have saved richard from being a shadow we find only generalisations the lurid evil which overhangs the man like a cloud is too phantasmal to stir the emotions and as a consequence his relations with the woman of the story leave us unmoved the dialogue in both these stories draws nothing from nature it is rhetorical hard bitter clever but never instinct with human modulations yet  the roman road is a book that dwells in the memory by reason of its unquestionable cleverness and moral earnestness the writers attitude towards life would be difficult to defineperhaps it is mainly rebellious with a reaching out after beauty and an acute though rather narrow understanding of it there is no broad outlook no appreciation of the human comedy no quiet contemplation of a world which after all is not without exquisite compensations and strengthening silences the concluding story which deals with children seems to us to suffer from the same faults it has imagination and strength but neither joy nor tenderness at the same time we believe that miss keats is a real and a sincere artist let her cease to evolve and begin to observe let her cease to worry and begin to contemplate and we have faith that an actual book would result the authors equipment is far beyond the average it only needs direction and a careful pruning,war_contra

B8803,"['6626099', '3168253']",  english episodes by frederick wedmore elkin mathews three of these five episodes are imaginative pieces of that high class of whioh mr frederick wedmores yvonne of croisio and a chemist in the suburbs  were previous examples a reader without imagination might regard them as pleasant stones but if he saw no more in them than the meagre incidents they record he would miss their essential charm mr wedmore describes the whole five as imaginative pieces i confess that the second and third of the number seem to me to belong to quite another category in the second a swindler from new south wales runs up a big hotel bill whioh he does not pay and trifles with the affections of the landladys daughter in the third a small tradesman disappears from his home causes his wife and family to believe that he has been drowned and takes another name and lives with another woman a few miles off these are perhaps true episodes of eaglish life as also of life not englishbut no imagination was needed for their conception or could fitly be employed upon their treatment well enough in their place they do not deserve the refinements of style whioh mr wedmore bestows upon them having said this i have no other word of deprecation to offer indeed the three pieces that remain possess quite enough merit to atone for the undesirable proximity of the two others these three have nothing in common except the quality which makes each of them excellent love is more or less the theme of all three but the aspect differs in each instance in  the vicar of pimlico  the tender passion is peculiarly tender it dawns upon the still youthful heart of a middleaged clergyman rather as a mild suffusing flame than as a consuming fire and it oomes in the person of a young girl who first interests him by the unsophisticated grace of her presence and the modest frankness of her nature it is a new experience to the middleaged man who does not in fact realise that it is an experience until pursuing the rule of his life he finds that there is something he must put away if he would maintain that single devotion to his work whioh makes for him the sum of duty but this putting away is not done without a pathetic effort one felt inolioed to question at first whether he should have written the letter in which he told millicent sergison that he loved her but that he was not for her nor she for him mr wedmore however is right it could not hurt millicent it could hardly fail to raise her selfrespect to know that such a man had loved her the very declaration of his feeling was a benediction if disappointment came with the knowledge that there was to be no tie and no further communication between them it would not be a lasting shadow for she was only twenty and youth has a time of conquest before it  the new marienbadelegy is a sort of converse to this study of renunciation in middleage of the young love that might have been won here we have an amiable dilettantea poet and lover of artwho goes to buxton to get cured of an attack of gout which his nonappointment to the laureateship has aggravated at buxton the charms of sylvia rawson gradually steal upon his somewhat coddled affections and he finds that there is a possibility of joy in life with which the delight of producing immortal verse or the rapture a perfect etohing may excite cannot compare but sylvia remains placid and unmoved and it turns out that she has had her time of love and that for her the dream has passed the third piece  katherine in the temple is much slighter than the other two and in a different vein from eaoh of them but it is as true as human as idealised as they it is his power of idealising and the delicate effects he produces which give distinction to most of mr wedmores work you are sensible of an atmosphere in whioh the refinements of life expand and flourish an atmosphere too highly rarefied to sustain the coarser forms of experience the subtleties of a dainty style are very winning in this book one sometimes feels in reading mr wedmore that the sentences ate too riohly laden for a structure of so delicate a character sentence within sentence and parenthesis within parenthesis carry what for the moment seems too full a largess of good things but one would not have it otherwise these elaborations are like the facets on a gemthey give colour and brilliancy the colour is abundant how well it comes out in such a passage as this sylvia rawsonit is difficult to describe her except by saying that she would give warmth and dignity to any landscape you placed her in she has almost everythingcolour expression and though not absolute faultlessness a singular distinction of form tall erect supple now walks with energy now lounges

wedmores pastorals and renunciations and with them should represent a permanent addition to the literature of the generation george cotterell  ii  inglish episodes by frederick wedmore 3s 6d elkin mathews mr wedmore has a genre of his own at least no one else in england attempts the same kind of thing on not very outoftheway types of characters he bestows minute care and analysis and having made his observations he sets down the result in fastidiously simple language his aim is evidently to look at each of his characters through the eyes of one similarly situated and if he is not always successful in this if the very cultivated critic and theorist of life be occasionally audible in the tones of his comments the fault is artistically pardonable because the aim is a difficult one besides it gives a certain personal interest to the stories and indeed with his more commonplace or at least humbler personages he has in this volume been singularly successfulwith mr salting who migrated to camden town and another mnenage when the surrey side and his monotonous domestic prosperity there had bored him unendurably and with the aerated bread shop katherine but  the vicar of pimlico is the best piece of workmanship by far readers may not be convinced that the reasons were good which kept the vicar a bachelor but they cannot but admire the subtle manner in which he is presented he is the type of the cultivated clergyman of the day alive to the needs of the hour yet with strong links of sympathy to the past but by reason of certain delightful individual traits he is a personage far more than a type mr wedmores work is throughout fine in texture and delicate in tone and we are glad to see it winning the wide recognition it has long merited,war_contra

world an episode in the life of a celtic squire not one of that select and possibly very respectable body who for some strange reason delight in prefixing the definite article to their patronymics but an ordinary mortal to wit one cathal more of cappagh house we presume in the county of mayo the period embraced in the narrative is the interval between december 1844 and july 1851 it purports to be a recital of actual occurrences and the characters introduced upon the scene we are assured are all drawn from life the second title to this work appears to us not to have been happily selected the principal deduction from the history before us as we apprehend being nothing more than that it is highly inexpedient for a landed proprietor to allow an unitarian to build a chapel on his estate from such a cause was it that most of the misfortunes d tailed in these volumes arose mr more and his mother we are informed had for a length of time exerted all their best energies in the management of their extensive territorial possessions and the amelioration of their tenantry on a stormy night in december 1844 their hospitality was solicited by two travellers whose carriage had broken down near the entrance to the domain the strangersfather and sonof the name of schelling were pressed to pass a few days at cappagh  they became acquainted with the rector of the parish mr hyde and his daughters catherine and agnes the individuals thus brought together make a series of agreeable excursions together in the vicinity from the conversations that ensue on these and other occasions we are led to infer that mrs more was a sensible intelligent old lady somewhat bigoted in her persuasions but sincere and amiable in every relation of life impressive eloquence she was in form a slight withered old woman worn by care and thought grave and gentle in her manner generally silent but when she chanced to speak of a topic interesting to her she became calmly but impressively eloquent one did not perceive the power of her words at the moment of their utterance but they left a deeper afterimpression than such orators as i have heard speak ever produced on me the charm was given to them by her wise life devoted to the cause of truth and her hearty faith in her own sincerity for these are the cornerstones of eloquence on which indeed it is good to erect an arch of wellsounding words out without which for foundation the finest edifice of language will be but an unsafe height to both the speaker and the hearer even her silence was  eloquent reposethe eloquent repose of lifes sunset glowing in the softened brightness that succeeds a burning day during which much good work in the vineyard has been done mr schelling was of german origin and the prejudices of his country biassed his theories and seemed in some measure to account for the strong belief he entertained in mesmerism a mysterious agent which according to him accounted for all that seems to ordinary people inexplicable in the mysteries which hourly occur around them he was moreover an enthusiastic unitarian losing on no occasion an opportunity of diffusing the principles of the creed to which he belonged anxious to carry out his plans of benefiting his poorer neighbours cathal more had made many ineffectual efforts to raise a large sum of money upon a mortgage of his estates mr schelling learning this and being a man of great wealth offered at once to advance the money upon condition of mr mores countenancing the erection of a unitarian chapel on his land after considerable hesitation mr more accepts the proffered boon the unitarian furnishes 20000 at four per cent upon mortgage of the cappagh estates and in due course the chapel is erected it was admitted to be a really beautiful edifice in the early english style and the architect neglected no means of appealing to the love of beauty inherent in human nature as he proceeded with his work the little edifice however no sooner received the last finishing touches of the mason than it excited the pious horror and roused the indignation of the vicinity a mr ludwig heinser is appointed the officiating minister and he spares no endeavour to obtain a congregation though all his efforts prove ineffectual to secure proselytes to his cause mr hyde the rector strongly reprobating the conduct of mr more in the business sternly refuses to visit at his house until the obnoxious structure is closed or removed cathal more himself is at length induced to view his own conduct in the light in which it is regarded by his friends and determines to undo the mischief which he is persuaded origiginated with himself heinser in his endeavours to aid his sinking cause becomes implicated in the rebellious proceedings of 1848 and only escapes conviction through the generous interposition of mr more meanwhile mr schelling becomes seriously discomposed at the turn affairs are taking and at the manifest failures of his attempts to fill the chapel on which so much outlay had been lavished nor are his annoyances diminished when he learns that his only son after a long illness and shortly before his death bad abandoned the creed of his father for that of protestantism the fathers curse he said not a word to any of us but he walked straight to where his son sat by the window rupert had sprung up to meet him when he entered but he had not time to advance before his father holding out a paper to bim asked him sternly what he meant by what he had written it was the letter that his son had sent four days before announcing his adoption of our faith lam sorry he began retract it instantly interrupted mr schelling  i see what means have been used to kidnap you he went on looking round at us  but before their faces you shall retract he spoke between his teeth and his words grated through them with a malignity of tone i never heard equalled my father said rupert who seemed to gather courage when his father spoke so roughly to him  ask what else you will and i will obey but not in this matter  i cannot retract  at peril of a fathers curse at peril of beggary at peril of ruining these people whom you call your friends will you refuse p asked mr schelling still maintaining a forced quiet of manner though he grew livid with the effort  so help me god i must said rupert firmly  so help you god repeated his father sneeringly  for you will need his help but now hear me rupert schelling and may the echo of my words never cease in your ears i curse the hour you were born your life and death your name and your religion i cast you off for ever except to injure you and those you love and as these friends of yours here are dear to you they shall be the first to suffer he threw his sons letter on the ground and grinding it with his heel he turned and left the room as abruptly as ho had arrived  rupert dear rupert all will be well you have done well said mrs more to the unfortunate young man who had sunk on the sofa i went towards him and lifted one of his cold damp hands it was dropping with blood and already a little pool had formed on the cushion under his head he had broken ono of the larger bloodvessels and the red lifestream was welling from his mouth mr schellings proceedings towards the more family after his sons death evince the most decided hostility the origin of which feeling we are subsequently informed is attributable to lonsubsisting jealousy the loan from schelling to mr more is attended with the ordinary resultsthe foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the cappagh estate and the personal effects of the owner at this painful juncture however a true friend appears in the person of major wyndham who plays a prominent part in the narrative and who at the momentous crisis to which we have alluded purchases for mr more not only the cappagh house and park but the pictures and furniture endeared by former associations mr more marries one of mr hydes daughters and determines to  become a real working man and practical improver instead of an idle country gentleman he demolishes the obnoxious unitarian temple and erects upon the site a cross on which are engraved these words  in this place i cathal more of carragh built a unitarian chapel this cross witnesses my repentance july ad 1851 mr schelling disappointed in his schemes of vengeance and under a threat from heinser that he will disclose certain fraudulent transactions in which they have been engaged commits suicide  thus dramatic justice is satisfied such is a brief indication of the history of cathal more assuming that it is not a work of fiction there is certainly not much in it to criticise the authors style is simple and unpretending though some of his observations indicate both thought and reflection still we do not apprehend that this his first literary production is calculated to awaken much interest out of his own immediate circle if on the other hand cathal more be a work of the imagination it certainly will not attain much popularity among those who occasion the principal demand for such books and whose appetite requires a more exciting pabulum than they will find provided

vanishing before natures equality of intellect which has its own nobilityyet it is verydoubtful if as a sober matter of fact such unions ever result in happiness though novelists do not recognise the truth that the highest intellect is part of a mind composed of passions and weaknesses and lodged in a body which has its appetites and demands its indulgencesin real life that truth soon makes itself felt and domestic life stripped of its romance is dependent for its comfort upon family friendship or hostility quite as much as upon competency of fortune it is lamentable to think that lofty intellect will be sorely discomfited if the leg of mutton is underdone that love  which tempests never shook  will cool at the sight of a milliners bill that the goddess must be seen in curlpapers and the idol of the romance in a dressingown and slippersprobably peaked with a red nightcap agreeing therefore with mrs trollope that unequal love is a capital theme for fiction we are bound to say that if it ends in an unequal marriage it is a very bad thing in reality and we hope that it will not be encouraged by the example of gertrude undoubtedly the wondrous diffusion of wealth hrs done much to destroy social distinctions the barriers that used to divide ranks are not absolutely impassable as formerly but they are still hard to be leaped democracy has tried to throw them down but the attempt has failed utterly by a curious revulsion of feeling nowhere are they more rigidly maintained than in democratic countries in the united states the social distinctions of classes are far more sedulously preserved than with us and among ourselves there is more repulsion among classes than in countries where the lines of demarcation are drawn by thelaw so it was in france the first demand of democracy was equality it was decreed by the law but was it obtained in fact bv no means classes only kept themselves still more aloof and to this day the nobles preserve their social rank intact though their political titles and power are wrested from them intellect alone crosses the barrier but even that does not accomplish it immediately the intellect of the man of inferior class is patronised courted used but it is not recognised as of equal rank gertrude is designed to illustrate the struggles between family pride and love ending in the triumph of the latter gertrude falls in love with her fathers secretary and marries him the interest of the story consists in the resolution with which through all trials and difficulties she remains faithful to her affection and resolute to her purpose and this is done without the sacrifice of any gernle trait of character which belongs to woman gertrude herself is a charming creation the best mirs trollope has produced the novel itself is wanting in one of the characteristics of her former most popular fictions there is no satire for the subject affords no field for it but it is in satire that mrs trollope is greatest that is her forte but let us do her this justice her satire is not illtempered it is the satire we admire and applaud in tliackeray and in puncha it has done good service in its time and if directed against the hypocrisies of our own day it would 1o good service again and we should heartily welcome the pen of mrs trollope to the exercise of its old functions gertrude has some clever scenes and some vivid sketches of character but we cannot help lamenting that the same power was not more usefully employed perry blake is the history of just such a lashing hero as might have been anticipatedt from capt

powerfully described and in the end he returns and marries the little cousin to whom he had sworn constancy at the beginning of the talehis heart let us hope nothing the worse for having been desperately in love with a dozen other women in the mean while it is a novel that will pleasantly beguile the evenings now growing long although in two volumes only lovee versus money is quite as long as the ordinary novel in three volumes if not longer so closely is it printed here too the title indicates the subject only instead of rank struggling with love as in gertrude we have love in conflict with money but the author of this latter novel has not mrs trollopes capacity for constructing a story nor her experience in the art of telling it an unpractised pen is visible in these pages but nevertheless there is promise in it some of the characters are truthfully conceived and drawn with considerable ability lote versus money is an irish story of the latter part of the 18th century and the author has carefully studied the history manners and characteristics of the period in which the scene is laid his principal fault is verbosity the characters declaim too much a dialogue should always advance the story or illustrate the character it should never be introduced for the mere purpose of filling up the pages in real life persons do not talk a whole page in one sentence that is not dialogue but declamation it is also a fault to be too minute in description something should be left for the imagination an instance of this fault is at page 96 in the first volume where nearly two pages are devoted to some tokens of affection offered by mrs ihardforth to eve this is only one example of many we name them because the author has abilities which cultivated and corrected might make him eminent  gertrude or family pride by mis trollope london hurst and blackett 1855 mrs trollope is an indefatigable caterer to the appetite of the novelreading public her tales do not follow each other it is true with the same rapidity as those which emanate from the fruitful brains of m g p r james or alexandre dumas but she has written quite enough and has been read quite enough to establish her claim to rank among the most popular circulatinglibrary romancists of the last quarter of a century we fancy however that her popularity must have been rather on the wane lately  for even the least thinking of novel readers have begun to doubt the good taste and good feeling of many of the books which they would have read a few years since without any such misgiving the affectations ot the silverfork school and the easy goodhumoured and rather clever vulgarity of the sect of which our authoress was once the prominent teacher have alike ceased to please even the uncritical class for whose edification their works were mainly written the  highmoralpurpose school now lias it all its own way and because thoughtful minds such as kingsleys mrs gaskells and poor miss bronteshave treated either directly or indirectly in their powerful fictions some of the great social questions which divide the world every one who now sits down to compose a novel thinks it necessary first of all to select a moral to which the story shall be appended or a high purpose to which it shall be rendered subservient even mrs trollope has forsaken what we for a long time considered her special and favourite walk of literature she has discarded the lowcomedy style of her earlier works with its broad fun and unrefined humour and not only uims at giving us in exchange the very genteelest of comedies but when her piece is over and the author withdrawn behind the curtain she comes forward with a moral by way of epilogue but there is a revolution dearly beloved reader which is steadily at work among us the progress of which is not the less sure because its onward movement is neither vehement nor noisy we aro perfecuy well aware that prosperous commerce and successful industry will often cause so near an approach between the toe of the commoner and the heel of the noble as to run some risk of galling a kibe and this is a fact still more patent in our days than it was when the keenest of all observers first made the remark but true as the remark was then and more true as it is daily becoming by the eager onward movement of this successful industry there is another cause at work also which i believe is likely to become infinitely more effective in lessening the distances by which society is divided than any which acquired wealth can produce nor is the lessening social distance its only effect social distance may be lessened with very litue chance of producing any feeling of equality as its result but let thc barons von schwanberg who make though renl  almanach de goth  not my almanack their guidebook let all such keep a sharp lookout upon the species of free trade in intellect which is so very obviously threatening to set at nought the prohibitions of heraldic lawgivers the perils arising from a too close juxtaposition between longdescended rank and newly accumulated wealth aro as nothing when compared to the revolutionary intluenco of widely diffused education in proportion as that highest order of education which develops the thinking powers of human beings incomes general the effort to separate society into distinct social classes becomes more difficult the system of enlarged education which is so evidently gaining ground among us will do moro towards lessening the inequalities of rank than all the heralds will bo able to withstand titles were abolished in france yet no equality of condition ensued but let the son of a tinker bom with a powerful and healthful intellect have that intellect fully developed by education and the effort to keep him within the tinkering sphere will be as vain as the attempting to make a thoroughbred racehorse pass for a fitting bearer of a packsaddle our readers will we think agree with us that mrs trollope has scarcely acted with the shrewd sense which might have been expected from her in thus attempting to ape the  highmoralpurpose  school her philosophy besides its painful introduction by its head and shoulders is bad iu itself foolish and what the french call inconsequent in what country in the world has so gifted and accomplished a young tinker as she particularises ever failed to distinguish himself or to win the great prizes of life  in austria especially which she unluckily selects as the country where all rising genius is put down we all know from what class the ministers and counsellors of state are chiefly taken but the whole argumentif argument it can be calledis so weak as to make us regret that mrs trollope should have adopted a tone which looks so much like canta vice from which her former novels are glaringly free and which must be utterly uncongenial to her nature this is not the only change we find in this clever womans manner of thinking and speaking we all remember the somewhat truculent toryism which was wont to characterise her now her idea of a lively leaven to give grace and sprightliness to viennese society is a sprinkling of lansdownes so far so good but of what other lordly wits does the reader suppose carlisles  and lord johns   the scene of the story is laid in austria in the present day the baron von schwanberg is a monomaniac on the subject of rank and dignity and determines at his daughters suggestion who uses her fathers weakness for her own ends that the young baroness gertrude shall wed no one whose family is not allied even by marriage with the princely houses chronicled in the  almanach de gotha gertrude thus throws on her sire the onus of refusing unwelcome suitors of only noble blood her affections are already bestowed on a youth who saved her life when they were but boy and girl and whom her father to show his gratitude takes into the castlo as librarian of course there are the usual troubles and griefs to be overcome which ever beset lovers in novels her fathers conscut to her marrying a poor scholar of plebeian birth it would be madness to endeavour to obtain  so they marry privately a young bride in her secret smuggles her to vienna to be confined after which event she returns to her father with this friend who was confined in the same house and at the same time and who takes charge of gertrudes baby pretending that she herself has had twins the father dies afterwards blessing his daughter and tended by her and utterly unsuspecting her secret gertnide is not a pleasing heroine she ridicules her foolish and indulgent old father who loves her with a devotion approaching to fanaticism she deceives everybody around her and evinces on all occasions craft and cunning even in the matter of her religion she cannot be truthful and honest she conceals the new faith to which the fervour of mrs trollopes protestantism has made her convert all her austrian heroes and heroines without the intervention of any proselytising pastor and in defiance of all probability in like manner the excess of the authoresss rampant patriotism induces her to transplant all her favourite personnages to england though why they should leave the scenes endeared to them by unbrokenly happy associations we cannot pretend to divine the hero is much pleasanter than his ladylove and count adolphe gertrudes first rejected lover is better than either his countess is an englishwoman meant to be delightful and fascinating y w to us she appears somewhat flippant aud vulgar she talks of persons being  monstrous good and  monstrous pretty and backs all her opinions with a bet sometimes introduced playfully thus  will you bet nie a solid honest english sovereign i dont mean our wellbeloved queen but only one of lier beautiful little golden portraits mrs trollopes readers however will scarcely expect to find her ladies and gentlemen quite justifying their claims to that social distinction altogether we think that wo prefer her ancient coarseness to her present  gentility it was more natural and a great deal more funny and assuredly her new stylo is not a whit less vulgar we will quote one of the best scenes from this novelthat in which the young count adolphe tells rupert odenthal of his rejection by the old baron for want of a princely alliance in his pedigree

right and that the fact of this unfortunate young ladys being the daughter of that insane old booby is and ought to be reason good against any one being in love with her  i never said so count replied rupert in a tone of indignation  i think her very charming and i know her to be very excellent but one cannotat least j cannotfall in love with the first pretty face and good young lady that one sees but this is all idle wandering do tell me and in an intelligible manner if you can what has happened to you  i will if j can replied the count  and the condition is but reasonable for how is a man to make that appear intelligible in relation which when it occurred had the very closest resemblance to a sort of obscure insanity  but wait a moment rupert and i will act the scene and this will give you a clearer idea of what has just passed than any narration of mine could donow then just sit you down there upon that fallen tree and i will sit down upon this one     you dont happen to have a book in your pocket do you rupert    the chances are in favour of it replied the young librarian laughing  you know my vocation count some of them generally stick to me if they happen to bc small and so saying he thrust his hand into his pocket and drew thence a miniature edition of  la fontaines fables  selected by fate on purpose to assist my exhibition  cried adolphe seizing it  only you must be pleased to fancy it a great deal more thick and a good deal more stumpy so now then remember if you please that you are the enamoured adolphe von steinfeld aud that i am the noble baron von scbwanberg  go on said rupert placing himself in the most touching altitude which the seat assigned him would permit and assuming an expression of countenance admirably calculated to suggest the idea of awmental struggle between love and reverence hope and fear  yes exclaimed adolph  that is the way i looked at iiiiuat least i hope sofor that is the way i intended to look but now mark me i flatter myself that you perceive at once my utter contempt and indifference for you and your looks my thoughts are here sir here iu this sacred little stumpy volume which is neither more nor less than than the  almanac h de gotha and thus i declare my will    no man shall ever marry my daughter with my consent whose family have not found a place here rupert sprung from ids pathetic attitude and indulged in a hearty burst of genuine laughter  are you in earnest count  he said when he recovered the power of speaking  most perfectly in earnest my dear friend replied adolphe  and now i presume he added that you will not wonder at my not wishing to delay my departure from the castle longer than was absolutely necessary  that you should wish to get out of his way if only to enjoy the laugh which i have enjoyed now i can easily understand  but not that you should so suddenly have recovered from your tender passion as to run away from the object of it  my dear rupert replied the young nobleman very gravely  i certainly think the baroness gertrude von schwanberg a very beautiful girl and moreover i have fancied right or wrong i scarcely know that she was more really intellectual and more capable of being a rational companion than any young lady i have yet seen    but be she what she may my good friend i would not take the daughter of that noble owl for my wife if she were ten times more beautiful and ten times more intelligent than i thought her when i galloped with a lovers speed towards schloss schwanberg this morning  you rather surprise me count adolphe replied rupert looking at him with very genuine astonishment  i must confess that i am except in theory extremely ignorant of such matters  but i certainly had fancied that a disappointment in love was a much more

namie of the author of  ouo vadis and there was ample room for introducing to them a powerful specimen of this younger novelists work gasiorowski is described bv his translator as an enilhusiastic admirer  of napoleon whose ardour is baed upon original research that of itself does not make a good hiktorical ronance but one is bound to admit that this long dramatic tale of the polish beautv madame de alewska with her aged jealous conceited beau of a huvband and her unselfish quixotic and fatal passion for napoleon carries the reader to the end with an intvrest that sldom slackens it is a subtle tragic episode the character of the heroine with her disappointed idal i9 handled with insight and vivid sympathy so are most of the minor figuresthev live and move napoleon is less attractive hi roic is senslial and selfish but the general impression left on the mind by a perusal of this fine though by no nmean great romance is distinctly one f trenth and directness in characterisation the tranilation reads fairly well but wvhv are so many spaces in the lines filled up with dots throughout the dialogue and the dtecription they have an ugly telegraphic look  flctlbtf napoleons love story by waclaw gamorowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth 6s we have read every word of this story with the greatest pleasure and interest and count de soissons claim in his brief introduction that gasiorowski though he does not bring into literature any new element is a very able master of the historical romance originated by sir walter scott is entirely justified the title alone seems a mistake napoleon either had no lovestory or he had a good many here we are concerned only with his brief passion or marie walewska a polish lady who was as good as she was beautiful and who belonged to that petite noblesse from which gasiorowski is himself sprung she bore the emperor a son alexandre walewski who afterwards became french ambassador at the court of st james represented france at the funeral of the duke of wellington and achieved a certain literary reputation he was a man with a heart of gold highminded and extraordinarily disinterested and it is evident to judge by this story that he inherited these qualities from his mother marie walewska married at twenty to a wealthy courtier of eighty conceived a romantic admiration for napoleon and the story depicts in the most moving and vivid manner her feelings when she begins to understand the real meaning of the emperors attentions that she yielded to him was a supreme act of selfsacrifice for she is led by the old polish statesman malachowski to believe that she will revive by her influence the fallen glories of her country she has a brother a humble lieutenant who learns of her shame which is at the same time the explanation of his sudden promotion to a colonelcy there is a dramatic scene between them not only does he cast her off but he throws in her face papers which contain damning proof of napoleons treachery to the polish cause to this succeeds a picture of quiet domesticity at schoenbrunn and then madame walewska is called to the deathbed of an old playmate of her childhood an officer named gorayski the emperor is bent on the austrian marriage and so a guilty colour is placed on the wholly innocent visit to gorayski and madame walewska is banished to poland not the least striking part of the book is her life when she returns to her aged husbands castle and the description of his reverential adoration of her baby son whom he always calls imperial highness we have had to pass over much that is admirable notably the scenes in paris the birth of the king of rome and the appearance of poor eleonore augier but we must mention the wonderful picture of polish society when napoleon first appears in warsawthe figures of talleyrand de segur duroc prince borghese davoust and many others mingling with the crowd of greedy courtiers and worldlywise women with whom madame walewskas native innocence and purity are strikingly contrasted yet the central allcompelling figure of the book is napoleon whether present or absent he is the determining force the masterspirit in whom every one is merged  napoleons love story by waclaw gasio rowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth  co m de soissons the translator of this romance of napoleon at warsaw tells us that the author is a napoleonic enthusiast so much may be gathered from the clear and vivid presentment of the fate of the virtuous and patriotic polish lady whose sorrows and betrayal at the hands of her ideal seem to evoke no contempt in the narrator to us it seems one of the meanest acts of one of the worlds great men poor mary walewska died for her enthusiasm  and in so doing only accentuated in her person the suffering entailed by the tyrant on the mass of her deluded countrymen the date is of course that of bonapartes presence in warsaw in 1807 when the revolutionary cloak had been abandoned and he was beginning to assimilate the pose of universal caesar the author a wellknown member of the school of sienkiewicz has given us a graphic study of polish society a century ago and the story though suffering to an english taste from rather too copious dialogue has many dramatic and some tragic passages while the characters especially that of the vain old courtier walewski are clearly cut the translation is well done but for a certain spasmodic method of conversation and a few slips of idiom,war_contra
B5398,['9449556'],  david elginbrod by george macdonald 3 vols hurst  blackett this is a singular book and evinces talent in spite of the strange mystical notions which seem to pervade the mind of the author on the subject of mesmerism and electrobiology a nervous reader will be not a little startled at the supernatural influence which is obtained by the villain of the story over the rest of the characters and the ghost is one of the most appalling specimens of her species we have met with for a long time albeit she is explained away and softened down quite satisfactorily at last david elginbrod has in fact tory little to do with the rest of the story he is merely an old scotch bailiff of extraordi nary piety and intellect considering his rank in life being anxious to improve his mind he obtains the help of the tutor at the hall who lends him books and teaches him mathematics as david has a beautiful daughter who assists at these lessons and is herself an apt pupil mr hugh sutherland the young tutor soon spends his evenings habitually in davids cottage those who are not deterred by the scotch dialect from reading this portion of the story cannot fail to be struck by the simple and original remarks of the old scotchman and the pretty poetical ideas of  maggie my dor who inherits the talents and the goodness of her father the most interesting part of the book however is hughs residence at armstead an old mansion in surrey swarming with spirits and legends and mysterious sights and sounds  here mr sutherland has for his pupil a poor i nervous boy who seems at first to be half j witted but who has only been badly managed and who under a more healthy method of training becomes a most charming and affec tionate youth the little fables by which hugh gains harrys attention and wins him from his dreary old romances are full of poetry and beauty euphra is now the heroine of the tale she is harrys cousin and keeps house for her uncle mr arnold at first she seems inclined to feel some jealous distrust of the new tutor who so quickly makes harry love and obey him but sho soon changes her mind and begins to flirt with him instead she was not pretty but  most women in whom the soul has anything like a chance of reaching the windows are more or less beautiful in their best moments euphras best was when she was trying to fascinatethen she was fascinating during the first morning that hugh had spent at armstead she had probably been making up her mind whether between her and hugh it was to be war to the knife or fascination the latter had carried the day and was now carrying him but had she calculated that fascination may react as well against euphras wonderful dark eyes and her flattering tongue and clever artifices the poor country lad of a tutor had no chance at all he was not exactly in love with euphra  lie had believed himself to be devoted to maggie elginbrod and he saw a great deal in euphra to disapprove she was false and unfeeling in many ways he knew frivolous and selfishbut she pretended to admire him and flattery is very sweet and so euphra made hugh her slave in spite of all his better feelings under the plea of learning italian euphra next induced the tutor to neglect harry and to spend most of his time teteatete with her and as she chose to accompany the gentlemen in their walks and rides poor mr sutherland became in a manner bewitched and scarcely answerable for his own actions presently some new actors appear on the stagean old mrs elton a sick young  lady emily and their maid who is no other than maggie elginbrod again also a bohemian count suddenly arrives in the neighbourhood and gains an entrance into the house under the plea of being a friend of the tutors he being a clever scientific man and just to amuse the ladies after dinner offers to show them a few little experiments in electrobiology the result is terrific the chairs and tables dance about the room violently the plates having the end of a pencil stuck through their rims not only write but even spell correctly ghosts are seen in all directions rappings are audible at every door and window the servants are driven to the verge of distraction and lady emily takes to her bed partly out of bravado and partly out of curiosity hugh lays a wager with the bohemian that he will pass the night in the  haunted room the very headquarters of the ghosts and the description of the visitor who appeared there is enough to keep anybody who is the least inclined to be fastidious in these matters awake for a week after reading it still more wonderful the ghost seemed to be addicted to stealing and two valuable rings disappeared from hughs room in the course of this eventful night of course the ghost turns out to be nobody in the world but euphra and the rings are wanted by the bohemian for private purposes of his own he had contrived somehow or other to obtain mesmeric influence over euphra and had made that lady his unwilling tool one interview between them is so extraordinary that we transcribe it here she had been impelled by some irresistible impulse to go in her ghostly dress to meet the count in the ghosts walk and meeting margaret elginbrod she had fainted with fright thinking the real ghost had come to reproach her  when she recovered she found herself lying in the wood with funkelstein whom she had gone to meet standing beside her her first words were of anger as she tried to rise and found she could not  how long count halkar am i to be your slavetill you have learned to submit have i not done

mine and you are in my power but you shall bo free notwithstanding and i will torture you till you yourselffind the ring the strangest part of this wild story is that the author treats all this as a commonplace everyday occurrence there is nothing apparently to be surprised at in count halkars power over euphra it is quietly explained as having been occasioned in the first instance by her own weakness some of my readers says mr mdonald may put euphra down as insane she may have been but for my part i believe there is such a power of one being over another though perhaps oidy in a rare contact of psychologically peculiar natures i have testimony enough for that she had yielded to his will once had she not done so he could not have compelled her but having once yielded she had not strength sufficient to free herself again whether even he could free her further than by merely abstaining from the exet cise of the power he had gained i doubt much here is a moral lesson to all

on the fire when you desire him to do so but to return to the victim of the tale poor euphra the tutor is dismissed rather unceremoniously on account of the missing ring which mr arnold had entrusted to him and euphra who really is attached to him becomes a victim to shanie and remorse she has also dislocated her ankle which however by no means prevents her tyrant from causing her to meet him in the avenue whenever he wishes it though she is incapable on common occasions of putting her foot to the ground she comes to london and margaret who has also the power of mesmerizing though of course she uses it only for the best purposes insists upon euphra resisting the counts attraction  holds her down in bed catches her on the i stairs and carries her back by forceand sue j ceeds at last in releasing the wretched woman  from her painful bondage euphra in a state of clairvoyance finds out the counts hidingplace and describes it so accurately that hugh is enabled to trace him out and obtain the lost j ring euphra dies from the effects of her terrible struggle against the counts power and hugh marries margaret elginbrod this outline of a very absurd story does no justice to the many beautiful passages and descriptions contained in the book the characters are extremely well drawn  the pompous stiff old mr arnold the sensible plainspeaking mrs elton and the gentle lady emily all being sketches from the ufo and affording capital contrasts to the fantastic euphra and her mysterious master the bohemian hugh sutherland is a pleasing but not wise young man warmhearted and

answer as stated by mr trench in the introduction is that writers of geniusamong whom a writer who has  perhaps more skill than sienkiewicz in  quo vadis i9 of course includeduse the historical novel to transfer to the stage of the world the drama which is being played in their own souls hence as mr d merejkowski believes in paganochristian dualism according to which the really full man the perfect man hould be equally  an hedonist and an altruist respect alike the soul and the senses and ally in harmonious equilibrium the cult of dionvus and the cult of christ he thinks fit to make great historical characters the instruments for expounding his own views on the subject in the second of the present trilogy of novels he modestly speaks through the lips of leonardo da vinci and savonarola in the third he selects peter the great who for some unknown reason he calls antechrist while in the present volume julitn is his mouthpiece but what julian means no one but the writer of the book can sav he starts as a student of plato but when he grows up and makes love to arsinoe he frankly says i am wicked and wish to be wickeder still whereupon the lady who afterwards become a nun

the sage as he fixes on his pupil  his penetrating and implassive eves it is perhals with a similar gaze that mr 1 merejkowki contemplates those who endeavour to extract a meaning from his writings on the whole indeed one can only wonder why a former fellow of an oxford college should introduce such a work as this to the british public its crude realism and affected learning may attract many who like to read of an empress wearing  an omolhoriunt covered with sapphires and hearthaped rubies or a subdeacon giving a circusgirl some rare stuff to make a long tarantidion of which in fact presuming that it is an article of clothing she was sorely in need there are too amiable persons who imagine that a jumble of philosophical phrases with latin and scripture quotations must be something at once virtuous and profound but the sensible reader will lay down this book with a sigh of relief and turn to the immortal chapters in which gibbon has described the same epoch the taste of that great writer is not always true but his judgement is acute his learning genuine and his sense sound the julian he depicts is an intelligent and intelligible being the julian of this strange volume is a mere

B2922,"['8663653', '8772463']",  old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends current in southern india collected from oral tradition by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere the illustrations by c f frere murray many of those of our countrymen who have spent years in india will be surprised to find that our edd friends the fairies and goblins are as well known in hindu nurseries as in our own it is true that the names are different in the far east from those we give them but their doings are much the same and if we are to be devoured or frightened to death it matters very little whether the horrid monster who is to slay us is called a goblin or a ghid as in persia or a eakshas which is the term in these pages for such fiendish apparitions it must be owned however that if there be any difference in morale between the indian supernatural beings and those duly recognised here it is not in favour of the former the riikbhas seems upon the whole a more hope less and unmitigated fiend than his western brethren to the notorious bad qualities of blunderbore and other gigantic cannibals he adds an excessive filthiness which sinks him to the lowest depths in our estimation not content with chawing up ali the live children princes and princesses that he can meet with he is moreover addicted to tearing the decaying flesh off the bodies of criminals pending from the gallowstree and swallowing it wholesale he is further exceedingly dirty in his person and hence his fingernails are so poisonous that a human being falls down lifeless if scratched by one of them female rakshases present themselves as ugly old women with long claws instead of hands and with natural chignons of dreadfully tangled hair which must on no account ever be combed for excellent reasons to be found in these pages dirtier than the ogre the rakshas is less accommodating than the goblin and would on no account thresh out the corn or in any other way oblige the farmer or any one else like the lubber fiends of the west after these remarks the reader will not expect the rakshas to be a funny character he is simply frightful and disgusting though he sometimes makes a fool of himself by mistaking for instance a donkeys head and an enormous earthenware pot for an apparition of one of his own kin and similar blunders but the rakshas though literally a horrid fool is never amusing the fun of the indian fairy tale is done by the jackal the puck of the hindus one of the best stories in this volume is the jackal the barber and the brahmin in which the jackal plays all sorts of mischievous tricks upon the barber and befriends the brahmin after a comical fashion he induces the barber to join with him in buying a garden and eats up the fruit himself while he makes the barber believe it is not ripe he then marries the brahmins daughter for it turns out that he is in fact a prince who is a great magician and puts on a jackals skin and changes himself into a jackal for a frisk returning to his own shape when he pleases he gives the brahmin a melon which produces fruit full of jewels but the silly brahmin sells them all without looking inside and at last gets taken up on suspicion of theft the jackal then gives him a dish which produces inexhaustible supplies of food but the brahmin cannot keep his own counsel and the magical dish is taken by the rajah foralast present the jackal gives the brahmin a vessel out of which jump a rope and a stick which bind and beat the rajah and the purchaser of the gems until they return to the brahmin what they had taken from him the peris or fairies of these legends are much like other fairies they sleep in pomegranates fly where they please and fall in love with handsome youths ad libitum as a specimen of the tales we will give an extract from the story of surya bai or  the sun lady who is the daughter of a milkwoman and was carried off by eagles when an infant she grows up in the eagles nest which is a very comfortable bungalow indeed at the top of a tall tree the birds having gone a long journey to bring her a diamond ring she just escapes being eaten by a rakshas is rescued by a rajah whom she marries and is pushed into a well by his first wife she is then changed into a sunflower and next into a mango and recovers her human shape but has to grow up from infancy once again   now it came to piss that once when surya bai was taking water from the well for the old milkwoman the rajah rode by and as he saw her walking along he cried  that is my wife and rode after her as fast as possible surya bai hearing a gnat clatter of horses hoofs was frightened and ran home as fast as possible and hid herself and when though rajah reached the place there was only the old milkwoman to be seen standing at the door of her hut then the rajah said to her  give her up old woman you have no right to keep her she is mine she is mine1 but the old woman inswtred are you mad i dont know what you mean the rajah replied do not attempt to deceive me i baw my wife go in at your door she must be in the house your wife screamed the old womanyour wife  you mean my daughter who lately returned from the well do you think i am going to give my chihi up at your command  you are rajah iu your palace hut i am rajah in my own house and i wont give up my little daughter for any bidding of yours be otl with you or i ll pull out your beard ami so saying she seized a long stick and attacked the rajah calling out loudly to her husband and sons w ho came running to her aid the rajah s eing mattrs were against him ami having outridden his attendants and not being quite certain iimrover whether he had seen surya bai or wle tier she might not haw been really the poor viilkwi aus daughter rde off and

voum not mind telling it to you now so the milkwoman called the girl and as soon as the old attendant xw her she knew it was none i other than surya rai and her heart jumped for j joy but sdio remained silent wondering much for she knew her mistress bad been drownd in the i tank the old mi ik woman turned to surya i5ai i and said  my child you have lived lng with us j and been a nod

being tired with the long wuk sh sat down to rest and placed me also on the ground when suddenly a great ka de flew down and carried me away rut all the father and mother i ever knew were the two great eaglesah my child my child cried though milkwoman i was that poor woman the eagks hew away with my eldest girl when she waa only a year old have i found you after these many years  and she ran and called all her children and her husband to tellthemthe wonderful news then was there great rejoicing among them all when they were a little calmer her mother said to surya bai  tell us dear laughter how your life has been spent since first we lost you and surya bai went on the old eagles took me away to their home aud there i lived happily many years they loved to bring mo all the beautiful things they could find and at last one day they both went to fetch me a diamond ring from though red sea but while they were gone the fire went out iu the nest so i went to an old womans hut and got her to give me some fire and next day i dont know how it was as i was opening the outer door of the cage a sharp thing that was sticking in it ran into my hand and i fell down senseless i dont know how long i lay there but wheu i carno to myself i found though eagles must have com back and thought me dead and gone away for the diamond ring was on ray little finger a great many people were watching over me and amongst them was a rajah who asked me to go home with him and be his wife and he brought mo to this place and i was his ranee but his other wife the first ranee hated me for she was jealous and desired to kill me and one day she accomplished her purpose by pushing me into the tank for i was young and foolish and disregarded the warnings of my faithful old attendant who begged me not to go near the place ah  if i had only listened to her word i might have been happy still at these words the old attendant who had been sitting in the background rahed forward and kissed surya kais feet crying ah my lady   my lady have 1 found you at last and without j staying to hear more she ran back t though palace to tell the rajah though glad news then surya bai i told her parents how she had not wholly died in  ihe tank but becanic tv sunflower nnd how the first ranee seeing how feud though rajah was of the i plant had caused it to he thrown away  and then j how she had risen from the ashes of the sunflower in the form of a mango tree and how when the tret blossomed all her spirit wt nt into the little j mango flower and she ended by saying and i when the flower became fruit i know not by what  irresistible impulse i was induced to throw myself j into your milk can mother it was my destiny  and rs soon as you took me into your house i j began to recover my human form j of course the rajah soon finds surya bai  and they live happily for the rest of their days i sir b frere tells us in though introduction i  it is probable that most of the stories were i brought from among the lingaets of southern j india the sect to which annadesouzu tells us i her family belonged before their conversion to i christianity this anna de souza was the i ayah who narrated the stories and from whose lips miss frere avrote them down but the book reminds us very much of the gul i bakawali a tale translated into urdu by nihill chand from the persian of shaikh izz ttulhih there is the same  exuberance of imagination the same mixture of the persian peris and dews with the gods and goddesses of the hindu system such as ganpati parvati and shiva the story at page 19b of this volume of  the brahmin the tiger and the six judges will be found nearly word for word nt page zl of the gul i bakawali apropos of this the word written  buceoulee at page 130 of this book is no doubt bahoxtli though story of singh rajah at page 172 occurs in the hitopadcsa as the ninth fable of the book headed separation of friends this only shows how widely and how long the old hindu stories have circulated we cannot conclude without noticing a curious circumstance mentioned in the introduction it seems that ghosts are received with presented arms in india though they are only challenged here  in the more advanced and populous parts of the country though rakshas seems giving way to the  bhoot which more nearly resembles the mero ghost of modern european superstition but even in this diluted form such beings have an influence over indian imaginations to which it is difficult in these days to find any parallel in europe i found quite lately a traditionary order in existence at government house dapoorie near poona which directed the native sentry on guard  to present arms if a cat or dog jackal or goat entered or left the house or crossed near his beat during certain hours of the night because it was the ghostof a former governor who was still remembered as one of the best and kindest of men more practical matter will be found at page xxiii of the introduction where there are some important remarks on the rise of prices in india in those days houserent did not cost more than half a rupee a month and you could build a very comfortable house for a hundred rupees not such good houses as people now live in but well enough for people like us then a whole family could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month as they can now on thirty grain now a rupee a pound was then two annas a pound common sugar then one anna a pound is now worth four annas a pound oil which then sold for six pico a bottle now costs four annas four annaa worth of salt chillies tamarinds onions and garlic would then last a whole family a month  now the same monty would not buy a weeks supply such dungeree as you now pay half a rupee a yard for you could then buy from twenty to forty yards of for the rupee you could not get such good calico then as now but the dungeree did very well beef then was a pice a pound and the vegetables cost a pie a day for half a rupee you could fill the house with wood water also was much cheaper you etdd then get a man to bring you two large skins full morning and evening for a pie now he could not do it under haifa rupee or more if though children came crying for fruit a pie would get them as many guavas as they liked in the bazaar now youd have to pay that for each guava this shows how much more money people need now than they did then in these days when there is a talk of forming a society for though translation of old popular stories miss frere will be admitted to have performed a useful task in recording these curious stories of the hindus the illustrations by c f frere are worthy of all praise and on the whole we cordially recommend the volume of snakeworshipa tempting subject concerning which these pages afford many opportunities to discoursewe shall say nothing at present in expectation of mr fergussous forthcoming work  old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere murray a few ancient legends told by an old hindoo woman to her grandchildren and repeated to miss mary frere who has reduced them to readable english are here given the public the family of anna liberata de souza the  narrator were of the lingaet caste and settling near goa when the english held pcesession of that place were soon after converted to christianity the father and grandfather of anna were both in british employ and she became an ayah although the deccan is included in the title of this book it doe not appear that theta stories originated in that district at burr bartle pren tells na in tha introduction that probably moat of them wan brought from among tha lingaete one of the most stronriy marked divisions of the hindoo neat south of the river kistna collections of stories of this kind an especially valuable at throwing a light on the popular nonbnhmmioal superstitions of the lower classes of india in tha neighlxmrhood of poona where brahminism appears to be to prevalent it it found that vithoba the deified sage kundoba the deified shepherd and byroba the terrible one of the remnants of fetish or snakeworship divide the adoration of the lower castes with the regular hindoo deities but the true history of these local divinities is only to be obtained from popular tradition and it thus becomes important to preserve these evanescent remains of the superstition of a former age en they disappear before the progress of civilisation the most prominent superhuman personage of the legends now before us is the  rakshas a demoniacal ogre of enormous sue and possessing terrible teeth like the ghouls of the  arabian nights his greatest pleasure is feasting on dead bodies  other characteristics will remind the reader of the giants of norse and teutonic descent at present the  rakshas is giving way to the bhoot more nearly allied to our modern european ghost but yet possessing an enormous influence over the native imagination in the hilly and desert districts of sind the belief in supernatural beings is generally prevalent but there the rakshas is transformed to the gin  of the arabian nights the gin ofthe mountainous parts of beloochistan is a  dwarfish human being with large eyes and covered with long hair and is apt to breathe with a heavy snoring kind of noise the cobra or deadly hooded snake also frequently occurs as a supernatural being one of the indications left us of the serpentworship once so prevalent in western india it will surprise many to learn that this worship still exists to some extent among the lower classes and that the cobra is supposed to possess supernatural powers the native does not willingly kill him but endeavours by kind treatment to propitiate him and obtain good fortune for the house to which he belongs there is a curious similarity between the incidents in many of these fables and modern european ones especially those of german origin and here also as in all fairy tales there are certain wellmarked features beautiful princes and princesses continually occur and perform the most wonderful exploits the stepmother is always wicked the youngest daughter good and beautiful and the elder ones are depraved and repulsive the giants and ogres are as easily deceived as the cyclopes from whom sinbad escaped or as polyphemus whom the crafty ulysses blinded the jackal takes the place of his european cousin the fox and by his ingenuity and tact generally conquers every difficulty  and proves a bright moral example of the success of wit against brute j forcethe triumph of mind over matter we observe however in the story tit for tat of this collection that the ordinarily stupid camel not only drowns the jackal but has the best of the argument also in the legend of  pnnchkin the wicked magician we trace a great resemblance between him and the wizards of the arabian nights he possesses the same power of changing men and women into stones trees or animals  he can build up a palace by a wave of his wand and create a river or a mountain by his magic arts the romance of brave seventee bai in which a woman shows so much prudence judgment and valour is somewhat remarkable as the production of a country where the fair sex are held in general contempt miss mary frere puts forward the conjecture that some aggrieved old woman might have invented this narrative the following fable might be used to illustrate emersons celebrated essay on compensation liss inequality than ken deem a young rajah once said to his wuzeer  how is it that i am so often ill  i take great care of myself i never go out in the rain i wear wann clothes i eat good food yet i am always catching cold or getting fever in spite of all precautions overmuch care is worse than none at ail answered the wuzeer which i will soon prove to yon so he invited the rajah to accompany him for a walk in the fields before they had gone very far they met a poor shepherd the shepherd wae accustomed to be ont all day long tending his flock he had only a coarse cloak on which served bnt insufficiently to protect him from the rain and the coldfrom the dews by night and the san by day his food was parched corn his drink water and he lived out in the fields in a small hut made of plaited palm branches the wuzeer said to the rajah you know perfectly well what hard lives these poor shepherds lead accost this one and ask him if he often sniffers from the exposure which heis obliged to undergo the rajah did as the wusser told him and asked the shepherd whether he did not often suffer from rheumatism cold and fever the shepherd answered  perhaps it will surprise yon sire to hear that i never suffer from either the one or the other from childhood i have been accustomed to endure the extremes of hest and cold and i eunpoee that is why they never affect me at thie the rajah was very much astonished and he said to the wuxeer  1 own i am surprised bnt doubtless this shepherd is an extraordinarily etrong man whom nothing would ever affect we shall see enid the wusser and he invited the shepherd to the palace there for a long time the shepherd wss taken great care of he was never permitted to go out in the sun or rain he had good food and good clothes and he was not allowed to sit in a draught or get his feet wet at the end of some months the wuseer ssnt for him into a marble courtyard the floor of which he caused to be sprinkled with water the shepherd had been for some time so little need to exposure of say kino that wetting his feet caused him to take cold the place felt to him chilly and damp after thc palace he rapidly became worse aad in a short time in spite of all the doctors care he died  where ie our friend the shepherd   asked the besh a few days afterwards   he surely could not have caught com merely by treadiaf on the nwbu floor yon liad caused to be sprinklad with water  alastn answered the wnaeera the reault wm mow disastrous than i had anticipated the poor shepherd caught cold and is dead having been lately accustomed to overmuch care the sudden change of temperature killed him  yon see now to want dsssers we are exposed from which the poor are exempt it ie thus that nature equalises her best gifts wealth and opulence tend too frequently to destroy health and shorten life though they may give much enjoyment to it whilst it lasts the moral of these fables is generally good in one is celebrated the victory of truth over falsehood in another ingratitude is chastised  and in a third an undutiful child is destroyed by a serpent in  a funny story  we have the terrible punishment of a wicked woman who was ashamed of her mother and illtreated her  and a powerful and sagacious cobra who is the good genius of the virtuous

piquant about it we are introduced to a fashionable  set  of miscellaneous com position largely leavened by an old and exclusive aristocracy with a pride in its mediaeval castles and pedigrees in the background but showing on the surface the most modern the least romantic of aims a society that dances and dines a great deal and is bound together by amusement but with some mediaeval fierceness not eradicated piety at convenient seasons and in a measure consistent with good breeding is not unfashionable and superstition of the crudest kind is almost universal an element of provincialism is not wantingit never is in an exclusive societyand its chief evidence is the naif delight in which everybody in the set seems to take in gossip ranging from the mildly mischievous to the blackest slander this is the world that mr crawford bit by bit and lengthily describes present it he hardly does perhaps the fatal mistake was the introduction of the british characters a british elemelt does not always make for dulness but there are dull britons and he has chosen that some of them should represent the virtues in the roman world of fashion a wellbred rigid complacency in lower circles it would be called smugnessis the pervading quality of laura carlyon she was not amusing but we are asked to believe she inspired great passions in three persons two of whom she married roman ladies gave her the cold shoulder though she was the stepdaughter of prince gerano they used her very badly sent her to coventry believed her stepsister adeles malicious tales against her and that she had the evil eye they evidently thought her heaviness had something occult about it her own countrywomen would not have made the mistake the plot is literally a plotthat of the nervous jealous adble to ruin lauras happiness and reputation it is diabolical mediaeval in its cruelty and crime very modern and also very ridiculous in its formthe placing of virulent scarlet fever germs in the dinner napkins of guests for instance is part of itneedlessly tortuous in its execution the vengeance that overtakes the sinner is likewise very modem she falls a victim to morphia but the relation of her sufferings is more tedious than painfully impressive the title of the story suggests however that neither the heroine nor the criminal nor the plot is intended as the main feature of interest but ghisleri pietro is like most of mr crawfords heroes vaguely sympathetic he is a poor man of fashion with a romantic past and a dangerous reputation for we dont quite know what he is very popular and fascinating in society by reason of qualities which are not explained we are led to infer that his intellect and aspirations soar far above the world he lives in but there is only hearsay evidence of this still he discourages gossip and behaves honourably if he does make love in a dull way to the dull laura if there were any evident motive or ambition however weakly fulfilled lin the story we should be inclined not to insist so emphatically on its failure but there is nothing of the sort a clever satirical direction in vol iii how to gain ease in conversation how to win a reputation for joining cheerfully in the

commands success  new novels pietro ghisleri by f marion crawford 3 vols macmillan  co considering the immense amount that mr marion crawford writes it is wonderful that he manages to maintain so high a standard of excellence  pietro ghisleri is the latest addition to the series of novels devoted to the delineation of modern italian society and it may fairly be pronounced to fall little if at all short of any of its brilliant predecessors alike by parentage and by opportunity mr crawford is admirably equipped for his task he has italian blood in his veins he has lived long in italy and his descriptions of the cosmopolitan society of her principal towns are written from the inside wnat he brings home to his readers with remarkable force in his latest work is the thinness of the veneer with which modern civilization has glossed over the primitive instincts of the italian race you have only to scratch the roman noble of today to findin certain cases at any ratea borgia underneath mr crawford has told a story of a womans hatred and of the dire revenge which she plans and executes for the sake of a wholly imaginary wrong baldly outlined the plot is repulsive and almost incredible yet such is the authors skill in treating of the development of adele savellis fixed idea that no strain is imposed on the readers credulity this skill in handling a difficult motive is again displayed in the whole episode of laura ardens first marriage we are made to realise fully the attitude of the world in judging of apparently so illassorted a match while its true meaning to those primarily concerned is set forth with a tenderness and pathos which mr crawford has never surpassed as for the personage from whom the book takes its title he rivets interest from the outset and ends by commanding respect and admiration he is essentially a strong and human character and the gradual growth of his nobler self under the influence of a good womans friendship is most subtly and delicately portrayed the minor characters are all clearly and vigorously sketched and though the plot is of an extreme and somewhat longdrawn complexity there are no dull pages in this elaborate and engrossing study in contemporary manners and morals,war_contra

himself is mr huxleys own kind and what he calls very prettily the congenital novelist  who creates a world of people not with the aim whether monscious or unconscious of illustrating a viw of life but for its own sake he writs if you will for fun though it would probably be more accurate to say dot he writes of necessity in an endeavour to relieve the pressure on his imagination of dte fantasy that haunts him he may be unintellectual and even in a sense unintelligent he may be lamentably deficientas dickens the greatest of them wasin poetic sensibility intellectual curiosity and moral ideas or he may bethough this has nt happened yetas infinite in range as shakespeare himself these endowments re beside the point what distinguishes him from others for the purposes of our definition is that he is the vehicle perhaps eve the victim of an incessant copious creaon now mr hugh walpole is a congenital nvelist his stories his people his world hough they have necessarily a personal clouring from their author bear that unmistkable mark of authenticity the air of king not only spontaneous but selfcreated the story of rogue herries is probably the ricst as well as the longest of mr walpoles novels it has movement colour humour and drama it is robust and fullmooded and it has the true flavour of its pjriod which is the eighteenthcentury it tains many scenes that linger in the nmeory the chinese fair where herries dls  by auction his too importunate msress davids assertion of his manhood hn threatened for the last time as it provm with his fathers whip the duel beteen herries and osbaldistone the death of margaret herries who dies in the oldfashioned conversational manner wet movingly the witchbaiting and many ither and smaller things the most and best of these memorable episodes occur in the first of the books four parts mr walpole is perhaps at his best in a scene of bustling good cheer such as the christmas feast at  statesman peels  it was a scene of brilliant colour with the blazing fire the red berries of the holly glowing in every corner old johnny shoestring in bright blue breeches and with silver buckles to his shoes perched on a high stool fiddling for his life the brass gleaming faces shining the stamp of the shoon the screaming of the fiddle the clapclap of the hands as the turns were made in the danceand beyond the heat and the light the dark form of the valley lying in breathless stillness its face stroked by the fall of lingering reluctant snow mr walpole has indeed all the gifts of the born novelist he has also some of the faults that are commonly found in a too facile writer perhaps it is mere idiosyncrasy on my part that makes me impatient with his frequent lapses into short and scrappy paragraphs perhaps i am wrong in thinking that it is a storytellers business to coordinate his information before presenting it to the reader and that he should not rely too much on the bellmans maxim  what i tell you three times is true mr walpole can write when he chooses as well as the next man and often a great deal better his prose is sensitive as well as vigorous and his vision is acute as well as tolerant but above all his fertility in the creation of characters the prime business of your congenital novelist and the skill with which he sets them moving together must be the despair of many a more painstaking writer yet there is something lacking here is a long book romantic copiously eventful full of life but one rises from it without that sense of a profound and satisfying experience which great fiction induces it is as if the author had taken with both hands what comes to him so easily scattered it over his page and never troubled to demand of himself that last degree of concentration that makes all the differenc for this reason or for another it lu intimacy in davids flight with sa for example the dramatic tension of a admirable if conventional situation is destroyed by a kind of chattiness the autho breaking in to tell us that on this very spot in a later century a descendant of these two lovers would conduct quite another sort of wooing elsewhere he adopts too often the tiresome device of telling us that soandso was  always to remember  this or that these things serve only to destroy the illusion by reminding us that we are reading a st they release us from the persuasion that we are sharing an immediate present experience the life of herrics begins for us at thirty and ends half a century later he is shown as an implacable dreamer tormented by a vision of perfection that is symbolised for him in the fantasy of a white horse of incomparable beauty swim ming a lake and climbing a hillside to triumph disappointed in his quest for this ultimate harmony the mystic consummation of all desire he lives wilfully shut away in himself and those who know him only by his outward conduct judge him a rogue and worse suffering from a kind of frustrated nobility he is often cruel ad arrogant and always lonely he loves no one but his son david until in his middle forties he chances upon a young girl called mirabell in whom he at once recognises his hearts desire unfortunately i find it next to impossible to believe in this youg woman or in herries love for her for me she is a figment of pure romantic fancy an apparition the projection of a dream and the authors persuasion dta she is as good flesh and blood as the mg of his people casts a shadow of unrealiy over the latter part of a delightful ad heartwarming and yet exasperating boo i gelw bullm  mew ltovels rogue herries mr hugh walpoles new novel  rogue herries is set in the eighteenth century and is a remarkable study of a man francis herries is a rogue a waster a libertine and yet a gentleman such a man as has been dear to a hundred and one women novelists but no woman novelist could have drawn this man so convincingly so accurately with such masterly and artistic detachment with so clear an insight into his muddied and struggling spirituality i do not know whether it is mnr walpoles masterpiece perhaps i am not far enough from its first reading to judge properly as to that but i do not think it will ever rank among his lesser achievements it seems to me to be a major booknot only for mr walpole but for any writer it is more too than the stuii of a man it is the study of a family of a period of a whole district of england its setting the lake country is quite as important as its events and the coloured spaciousness of his descriptions has a value that is subtly dramatic perhaps more dramatic in essence than many of the apparently more dramatic moments in the plot mr walpole does not write like a poethe is too accomplished a technician to write sentences that might be mistaken for  poetic prose  vet there is something of a poetic sweep of a poetic creativeness about this long mellow and wholly coherent book from the first moment when we see herries in the inn at keswick we are conscious of the truth of his presentation as a psychological study the man is alive from his first entrance and mr walpole has a felicitous power of making his characters betray themselves in their insignificant actions as much as in their larger it is by our trivialities that we are known and the cumulative effect of a characters trivialities is the real triumph in his creation herriess wearing of his rich clothes to meet his pompous brother is a revelation all the more sure because it is not thrust at us but insinuated to us without undue comment at the moment and without analysis beyond its own open fact yet how significant it is of the rebel  the book as well as being a fulllength portrait of one man is a whole gallery of portraits some of them sketches of people in a particular moment others of people growing developing and reacting through a whole series of moments it is impossible in a reviews short space to give a proper idea of the variety of men and women who are painted in this book the whole herries family seems to be living before us when certain members of it are entirely in the background we are yet conscious that they are still living and going about their daily rounds somewhere outside the book covers and we wait for this or that member to reappear produce his or her reactions and show the family characteristics coming out with almost the sureness of fate perhaps the family was to the herries fate there are many studies of child life and these are as profound as they are exquisite the study of the son of e  rogue herries by hlugh walpole ios 6d macmillan mr iugh walpole osing for his bust to mr david evans rbs rogue herries david is as masterly as that of the father yet a little less interesting because he was himself a little less interesting but we are able to watch the father and the son diverging and yet never separating we can appreciate the antagonism in temper which never becomes an antagonism in appreciation both are men rarely has the almost feminine jealousy of a father been more finely described than in the chapter entitled  the seafather and son the emotion is so masculine there is sentiment but no sentimentality and at the back of it there is something so virily wilful both are menfor indeed it is at that moment that the young herries comes into his manhood the women are no less admirable the wife of herries so truly feminine in her lack of intuition rather than in her possession of it the daughter deborah subtle in her very subduedness and most of all mirabell starr there is a touch of goethes mignon in mirabell she has not the poetry of mignon but she has something of her peculiar apartness as if she were a being not perhaps of some other world but of some other manner of inner life it is not often that characterisations so primitively simple are so symbolical too i find looking back on the book that nearly all my impressions of it are either of the people in it or of the country in which it is set and i wonder whether that was mr walpoles intention scenes of drama and outside event in the book are neither few nor far between yet it is the people i remember first and the happenings afterwards but as i think again certain chapters do leap out with intensities of their own the death of the wife of herries the funeral of greataunt mariawith its extraordinary little study of the dog the pitiful drowning of mrs wilson the witch these undoubtedly are at the very height of modern fiction and i am far more tempted into byways of appreciation than along the high road of direct criticism if i may be allowed to remember that i am supposed to be  reviewing  this book i will venture one point of criticism though i feel ungrateful in doing so there is little humour but there is a wealth of quiet irony mr walpole does not repeat himself and this period novelthe fortyfive occurs in the middle of ithas a genuine freshness of inspiration at the same time its psychological wisdom is too penetrative and true for it to have the false freshness of romance it is a serious study of life a mature studv and a work of art wallace b nichols,war_contra

of imagination and for excellence of memory we know no one who can compare with that eastern lady who every morning in peril of losing her head contrived to draw from it at each coming daybreak for about two year3 and a haifa pretty story which effectually stopped execution the orientals say that silence is goldbut if the arabian lady had been as mute as leoma instead of being as loquacious as the queen of cambles who was devoured by her husband as the only way of silencing her she would certainly have fared worse and the world of light readers would have had some volumes the less in their libraries the success of the arabian nights called into being a multitude of imitators of oriental authors the stories in the collection so entitled are far from being suitable reading for young people and this has been seen by those editors who have made judicious selections for youthful readers of either sex of all the writers who have told stories or apologues in the eastern style thc least successful in this way perhaps was the author of  almoran and hamet the best was without doubt the chevalier de boufflers the author of  la heine de golconde the first story was in vast repute with our greatgrandsires  but we question if it either amused or instructed the young monarch for whose delight and edification it was said to have been written some criticgrimm if we remember rightly summarily criticised the story on its translation by the abbe prevost by remarking of the chief personages connected with this rhapsodythat almoran was a madmanhamet a simpleton their tutor a pedantand the author a fool the world perhaps will accept threefourths of the critical opinion so magisterially expressed  the queen of golconda like  almoran and hamet is oriental without having anything in common with the arabian nights it is as smart as  vathek and is pleasanter reading except that there is marked upon it the trail of that serpent which defaces so many french books otherwise of great merit this is the more curious as  aline reine de golconde was composed under very singular circumstances the chevalier de boufflers had withdrawn from the gay world where he had long sparkled the most brilliant of chevaliers he had exchanged the salons of paris for the seminaire de stesulpice in one of the cells of that celebrated establishment he had shut himself up in order to put himself into training to become a bishop he spent a few months in preparation for the responsible office in question consuming the whole of that period in the composition of thc sprightly story above named when he found that he had written a tale of which voltaire not foltairescott as eugene of the ambigu remarked the other day might have been the author he very properly con eluded that whatever his inclination may have been he had no true vocation for the episcopacy accordingly he reappeared in the world published his gaillarde volume clapped his sword on his thigh and set out with gaiety to fight the kings battles in germany a more direct imitation of the arabian nights and of the shuttingup of one story in another like the boxes in a conjuring trick is now before us in mr merediths  entertainment indeed it would be improper to call  almoran and  aline imitations of the stories listened to so eagerly by the eastern potentate mr meredith has avowedly imitated the style and manner of the oriental storytellers but his  shaving of shagpat he says  springs from no eastern source and is in every respect an original work let us add that it is a work which exhibits power of imagination ability in expression and skill in construction the task which the author set himself was not a light one it could have been no easy matter to fill near four hundred pages with incidents scenery personages customs and language all arabian without tripping this however mr meredith has effected he knows how to make his characters talk as well as look like arabians and it cannot be said of him as the german peasantboy said of himself when asked to repeat the pater noster that he knew the tune but could not remember the words the book however is not without faults shibli bagarag the barber and not shagpat the clothier is the hero of the latter we see but littleand this is the more to be regretted as the first portion of that little makes us hope that we shall have much more shagpat in his obesity and sleepiness reminds us of that king mentioned by one of the authors quoted in athenaeus who was so stupendously fat and so continually slumbering that when his friends visited him they took the long gold pin which hung from his girdle for that purpose and run it into his fat in order to wake him up into a little consciousness and conversational power shagpat with his head of hair is as magnificent as the venetian magnate spoken of by sismondi whose heard was so long that unless he carried it over his arm he was constantly treading upon it when walking why shagpat wished to preserve his hair may be read in the  entertainment how he looked may be seen below  he looked before him and lo one lolling in his shopfront and people standing outside the shop marking him with admiration and reverence and pointing him out to each other with approving gestures he who lolled there was indeed a miracle of hairiness black with hair as he had been muzzled with it and his head as it were a berry in a huge bush by reason of it then thought shibli bagarag tis shagpat if the mole could swear to him surely can i so he regarded the clothier and there was nought seen on earth like the gravity of shagpat as he lolled before those people that failed not to assemble in groups and gaze at him he was as a sleepy lion cased in his mane as an owl drowsy in the daylight of applause now would he close an eye or move two fingers but of other motion made he none yet the people gazed at him with eagerness shibli bagarag was astonished at them thinking hair hair there is might in hair but there is greater might in the barber nevertheless here the barber is scorned the grower of crops held in amazing reverence then thought he tis truly wondrous the crop he

khipil a dilatory architect who had promised to build a palace for the king within a certain period and failed to keep his word king and builder were walking together over the unfinished edifice  then he bade khipil lead him to the hall of state and when they were there shahpesh said  for a privilege and as a mark of my approbation i give thee permission to sit in the marble chair of yonder throne even in my presence o khipil khipil said  surely o king the chair is not yet executed and shahpesh exclaimed if this be so thou art but the length of thy measure on the ground o talkative onekhipil

eying the king and made pretence to sit in the chair of shahpesh then said shahpesh as a token that i approve thy execution of the chair thou shalt be honoured by remaining seated in it one day and one night but move thou to the right or to the left showing thy soul insensible of the honour done thee transfixed thou shalt be with twenty arrows and five the king then left him with a guard of twentyfive of his bodyguard and they stood around him with bent bows so that khipil dared not move from his sitting posture and the masons and the people crowded to see khipil sitting on his masters chair tor it became rumoured about when they beheld him sitting upon nothing and he trembling to stir for fear of the loosening of the arrows they laughed so that they rolled upon the floor of the

stated in a daily newspaper that a novelist must be true to his age and implied that if the age is trivial he must write of trivialities or go unread miss thompsons mistake is in assuming that any age can be fundamentally trivial polyandrous american women with whitecarpeted diningrooms and footmen who wear yellow liveries in the morning literary philanderers who dine with their divorced wives and the clever cocktail drinkers who fill the pages of  winter comedy  are an insignificant fraction of the modern world or if they are not mliss thompson has failed to convey their significance her book of course has the usual merits of her work there are clear descriptions and clever rather edwardian conversations but these are not enough from an author who has shown herself capable of dealing with more worthy themes the two young australian collaborators whose first novel was hailed by mir arnold bennett as  a major phenomenon of modern fiction have again taken sydney in its early days as a background but the australian scene is only incidental and not essential to the story as in  a house is built an uppermiddleclass family is reduced to poverty and disgrace through the fathers suicide lucy the eldest daughter grimly resolves to maintain their pride and pave the way to the restoration of their fortunes by her two brothers  green memory is the story of her struggle and of the defeat which leads her to the realisation of higher values the book is pleasant and readable but it is to be hoped that these two authors will soon emerge from the nineteenth century and bring their delicate

mr lewiss dogmatic  this is life i  it only answers  oh is it   and the reviewer who acts as a sort of reporter to these matches gets out of the difficulty by adding  well perhaps not life butdont you see literature to that there is no answer miss thompson seems to tackle modern life in winter comedy but in fact she only makes circles round it she is concerned of course with  modem problems discontent in the air a few bloodys slung about the triangle preliminary to the divorce court is it possible to be a nice quiet woman with all this jazz about  to have your fling and keep it too  to go native for a bit and be a good wife in the country and then crash off to paris with a lover  the answer to all these problems is simple yes you can do it with money all the characters in winter comdy have money when the book starts so that virtually miss thompson found the answer to her problems before she began writing one may be able to pity the poor little rich girl but not the poor little rich girl who pities herself miss thompson fusses too much over caroline she even makes her paint pictures art is so serious actually caroline is a sensationalist without the full determination to get her kick out of life she hovers between being in love with two men both determined and in earnest she loves the one who happens to be there in the end it is her husband who is there and all ends happily winter comedy is not a definitely bad book it is well written and the characters are individual though they have their stagefaces towards the reader but the whole atmosphere of the book is of a lot of people acting up to a newspaper article on  should wives leave home all very concerned and quiet and being damned decent about it miss thompson writes so well that one wishes she did not read newspapers stanton is also a novel with problems but in this case the problems are the most interesting part of the book mr desmond coke has written a number of novels about schoollife which are realistic and sympathetic and stanton is an unexaggerated account of a boys life at school and his return to it as headmaster the story is uneventful as it was bound to be but mr coke does succeed in giving two views of a schoolthe boys and the masters he gives you bits cf genuine schoolboys conversation slangy and punctuated with kicks and the commonroom with its rivalry between young and old masters its espritdecorps and carefully innocuous  great scotts is admirably true the problems of the book are not newspaper ones sex as a fact or a topic of conversation is only incidental and boys do not fall in love with their housemasters wives stanton began as a private school with a hundred boys a good deal of freedom and an unimportant seaside existence and after forty years it moved inland and became a large public school games were made compulsory everything was well worked out and punctilious stanton was recognised as turning out the  right type which begins at birth on a waitinglist and goes out afterwards into the world wearing the right tie which school was better the old or the new  there is no doubt about mr cokes answer and he states the argument with genuine force the book of course is something more than argument for one system or another but its argument is inherent and its problems real susan spray and the limestone tree are so amazingly competent and

as either they have the common habit of adopting a county or an island of romanticising the common life and exploring it through a series of books in extraordinary detail it is like filling in the corners of a large canvas there is no new canvas or fresh vision the same picture becomes more and more complete miss kayesmith is not interested in the modem world not even to mr chestertons extent of exploding fireworks in it she has chosen sussex as a rambling ground because the life is oldflavoured and literary associations are strong in susan spray she goes back a hundred years and traces the career of a woman preacher born on the border of sussex and surrey as a small child earning a few pence a week in the hungry forties scaring crows susan invented a vision of god in the field and expounded it at a sunday meeting as she grew up these visions fostered by vanity and histrionic talent increased in intensity susan became leader of the colgate brethren through her three marriages religion with its implication of prophetess hardened her to a ruinous selfishness she was capable of falling in love but her fanaticism made marriage impossible miss kayesmith gives an admirable

and even when they appear with no particular story wrapped about them they are welcome if only for their grace the title story is the best not so much for the sake of the beautiful madelinette as of her patriotic proud poetic and impossible husband the seigneur of pontiac mr parker has been elsewhere more of an artist but we have in these tales a greater sense of reality we feel the observer more than the inventor and therefore it does not surprise us to hear the author saying this collection has been the most cherished of all my labours covering as it has done so many years and being the accepted of my anxious judgement out of a much larger gathering  the lane that had no turning short stories by gilbert parker heinemannthis is a collection of stories of frenchcanadian life when a successful novelist publishes a collection of stories written as these have been written during a number of years one cannot help suspecting that he is giving what is not quite his best it is however clear that in the present case mr parker should be under no such suspicion these stories are he says the accepted of my anxious judgement out of a much larger gathering and he expresses a not too modest hope that they are addressed to the public of the empire it is impossible to guess what the british empire may think of these tales but some humble individuals will assuredly find them too diffuse in narration and in incident too full of blood and poison one gladly almits that the setting is picturesque and indeed that every true study of life and character in lower canada is of peculiar interest to english readers  but one may be allowed to doubt whether this collection was worthy to be dedicated as it is to sir wilfrid laurier it is unfortunate that the stories do not succeed in conveying the impression they are intended to convey of the character of the frenchcanadians the least attractive and admirable traits are those that are most prominently brought forward to achieve what mr parker meant to achieve would require a more sympathetic imagination and a literary skill of a more delicate kind than he has succeeded in bringing to bis task the principal story is a well constructed piece of melodrama but one may hope that it is as unlike real life as a melodrama can be mr a t quillercouch has carried the art of writing short stories to a point at which they give considerable pleasure to the reader a volume containing fifteen of these narratives and dialogues has been lately published and is entitled old fires and profitable ghosts cassell  co they deal with ghosts and with events in cornwall and with 44 persons who either in spirit or in body revisit old scenes return upon themselves or old emotions or relate a message from a world beyond perception we quote this description from a prefatory note which also recounts the origin or explains the meaning of some of the fifteen stories one of the collection entitled once aboard the lugger eeems to have been written out at greater length and published as a volume under the name of 4ia the story is well handled in both forms and mr quillercouch expresses an opinion in favour of the shorter version as it appears in the volume now before us though he adds that others differ from him there is in fact little to choose between the two  old fires and profitable ghosts is a volume which deserves recognition and appreciation the house of the giants ward lock  co is the first and longest of fifteen stories of incident and excitement by yorick everett mr everett says that he has tried to see how fiction might work  when reduced to its lowest terms by rejecting superfluous detail and keeping only what is indispensable to the story that is just what a writer of short stories is naturally called upon to do there is nothing original in the device 4 the house of the giants falls between two stools it occupies more space than the other fourteen stories put together and is neither long nor short it tells of a german spy hunted by a russian agent on english soil and the rescue of hie interesting eister by a scots journalist a london artist and a yorkshireman it is a variant of an ofttold tale and the only excuse for using the flame materials and motives again would consist in resetting them with exceptional skill and eurrounding them with artistic or pathetic side interests which would be anything but superfluous details some of mr everetts shorter sketches are ingenious and satisfactory from messrs harper  brothers we have received a copy of palace tales by mr h fielding who is already known to the reading public as the author of a book dealing with events in upper burma entitled 4 thibaws queen which was reviewed in these columns some few years ago in the present instance mr fielding has reissued in england a collection of short stories which he tells his readers were current in court circles in days when burmese monarchs still filled burmese thrones and which he contributed in the first instance to the columns of the rangoon gazette if somewhat bordering on what greybearded critics might describe as frivolous these eight short tales are at any rate pleasantly written laughable and light nor does their collector and editor claim for them much more in the way of merit than this  but he points out and with great truth in his introduction that during the fifteen years which have elapsed since upper burma was incorporated with the possessions of the british empire much has changed and all is changing fast the palace still stands but is growing old and faded  and even more quickly than palace buildings decay the people who dwell around them are exchanging their old thoughts and habits for new ones mens memories are short in countries where books and histories are few and for the most part inaccessible so that praise is deserved by those who attempt to rescue from impending oblivion phases of life in the courts and chambers of an oriental king it would probably be wise however if those who dwell far away from asiatic courts and into whose hands this volume may fall exercised some caution in accepting it as in all details typical of the ways and modes of thought of kings princes ministers and courtiers the tales may be substantially correct that is they are tales which were told within the palace as they are retold in this book  the events described are so told in order to move mirth but the storyteller probably never intended his listeners to suppose that he was dealing with other than imaginary personages and imaginary situations thus if the king disguised and attended by a single courtier slips out of his palace after dark and prowls up and down the lanes around his capital all sorts of marvellous and thrilling incidents may be created  but that any burmese monarch ever could or did so expose himself to danger  in violation of all the venerated and binding laws of court etiquetteis open to considerable doubt the eighth and concluding story is perhaps the one most exposed to criticism the transmutation of the narrative from burmese into literary english may possibly be responsible for many wide departures from the language of the original but there seems also to be an air of improbability about numerous passages which can hardly thus be accounted for who can tell us how royalty in eastern palaces acts and speaks in its private chambers amid wives children and intimate associates when court ceremonials are ended  for ourselves wo pretend to possess no such knowledge  still we are far from satisfied that a chief minister would disturb his sovereigns leisure about a love affair in which one of the princes was concerned such minister knowing that somewhat later in the day he would see the king in the regular course of business it seems doubtful whether an experienced minister would risk the hostility of the kings brother by coming between him and the object of his affections would his majesty really eat mangoes with his chief queen would he not rather himself be eating the fruit while the chief queen on her knees humbly held the dish    what do you suppose be wants to see you for in such a

B4404,"['6455904', '8787991']",  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs d nuttas suredly one of the most delightful collections of fairy tales that we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  the admirable illustrations by j d batten are worthy of the tales no wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dress  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language,war_contra

cigar did they drop their rs in those days  it hardly matters what does matter is the importation of a type whose presence in a mundane narrative is as perplexing as that of melmoth the wanderer we refer to the philosophical raphael dominick in whose company the probabilities suffer severely it is a character such as a poetromanticist could invest with charm knowing him to be patently of the stuff of dreams he would have filled him with the mellifluously mysterious speech of dreams and he would have been lifeless but beautiful but the lips of this bodiless zangwill open but to emit a crashing discord of clevernesses in chapter xxl book il he avenges bis creation by making even broser momentarily impossible we also object to the manner in which the characters run against one another for the convenience of the plot this is certainly victorianboth early and late the feminine triumph of the book in our opinion is elijahs wife in youth like how many heroines of fiction  she had clasped a hunted hare to her bosom an action that had made elijah fall in love with her but the cherisher of hares was a nagger of the most impracticable kind  you sent him to the shambles she screams to her innocent husband when she heard that their headstrong son had been killed in the war but when elijah is being mobbed for little englandism she rediscovers the hare in him and cries  fight fair you hounds of hell it is probable that this woman will appear overdrawn to many but we can vouch for the fact that she is an ablystudied cymric type allegra the heroine is drawn more ambitiously she writes a letter to her middleage as mrs meynell did to her old age but she uttered no words comparable with these oh in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee suddenly though time darkness silence hide thee this wind from thy lost country flits beside thee yet allegras letter which recurs as a motif in the book rings pathetically true the idealist she thought to marry turned out to be selfinterest under another name the idealist she did not marry was become a mere egoist and for refuge she had nothing better than a motherly representative of the feudalism she had once despised but we must pause mr zangwills book is as a whole worthy of his reputation lt is wise and witty serious and pathetic if it be not all life it is at least life and mr zangwill and the second of these twain is not bad company even when out of place  the mantle of elijah new novels by i zangwill heinemann that the mantle of elijah is worth reading and that it takes a little more than ordinary reading are selfevident facts matter and style combine to warn off the skipping or casual reader without exactly sympathising with mr zangwills points of view you are interested because he presents them and their interpreters in an arresting fashion there is sincerity in some of the intellectual and moral attitudes of his figures his style has matured a great deal since the days some fifteen years ago when  the premier and the painter was published but even then he showed himself to be as now of a different stamp from the facile and obvious novelists of the hour his new book contains cleverness of a very varied kind traits of fine imagination of high spiritual feeling keen observation of the actual and a singular sense of discrimination in character and dialogue jostle each other he has at command a fund of epigrammatic utterances but unlike the general run of such sayings they are not mere interpolations put in for their own sake they spring from the substance and sentiment of his work and may not be easily dissociated from them the principal interest is political it is also retrospective it is the period when crinolines berlin wool and bad ormolu were in vogue mr zangwill enjoys himself over a description of the decoration of a certain clock where art concealed the article so do we in this tale of a bygone timeand here is part of the clevernessmuch in our present political position is not only suggested but even implicitly judged the antiwar note the  lay down your arms is made to echo with no uncertain sound but there is full as much of private human nature as of politics and the domestic horizon and the motives and working of housohold minds are never swamped in the deluge of public affairs at home or abroad twenty years is a long run for the action of a story especially in these days the mantle of elijah almost demands as much for the development of the intellectual and moral forces of the leading characters they require full play and they get it now and then one feels that they almost get too much of it that the analysis and presentation are almost too close too serried the treatment of the engelborne group in the last part is not altogether happy these people are rather copiously than powerfully drawn yet their influence on allegra the heroine is a reason for their being at the age of sixteen allegra is a convinced but not unattractive idealist this is the most entertaining and interesting part of her career when we meet her again in book il she is a married and disenchanted woman of forty or thereabouts her illassorted marriage with broser a radical politician and her fathers secretary never appears wholly credible he is a strongly marked individual one of the best portraits or pictures in this gallery the mantle of the radical statesman an aristocrat by birth drops at length on the brawny shoulders of broser his follower only too ready to catch it he is the most robust and selfseeking of all the sons of the people yet depicted in fiction one feels the jarring aggressiveness of the man and the coarse germs of good and evil in his temperament he is strangely real the contrast between him and his amiable highsouled leader and the family is an excellent study the list of the peoples grievances and their remedies drawn up by broser and those mr zangwill calls  the boon companions of his political intoxication  is good satire so are his entrance into the house and his subsequent change of front then there is a visionary and much less strongly conceived being an israelite who rhapsodises on a new spiritual species adapting itself to a new spiritual environment and other recondite topics the closing scenes wherein he and a poisoned dagger figure show a slight uncertainty and a weakening

B45,"['6800721', '9412306']",  the californians reviews by gertrude atherton lane it is always with a flash of surprise that on laying down a novel by mrs atherton we realise how good it has been she really has all the faults her philosophical and critical jargon is hopelessly out of place and her chorus of girls with their frocks and their eyes are quite as vulgar as she intends and she has never learned how to write style she says with unconscious irony  style alone will give you a place in letters worth having but style is a land unknown to mrs atherton it is not for want of trying she  wordpaints conscientiously and strenuously and she clangs on every critical nerve consider this once she rode to the foothills escorted by dick they were covered with yellow and purple lupins miniature jungles which harboured nothing more sanguinary than the gopher and the cottontail the tawny poppies had hills all to themselves a blaze of colour as fiery as the sun to which they lifted their curved drowsy lips the mariposa lilies grew by the creeks in the dark shade of meeting willows the goldgreen moss was like plush on tile trees from the hills the great valley looked like a dense forest out of which lifted the tower of an enchanted castle not another signal of man was to be seen nothing but the excrescence on the big weddingcake house of a bonanza king beyond the hills rose the slopes of the mountains with their mighty redwoods their dark untrodden aisles their vast primaeval silences how it jars the ugliness of that plush upon the trees the grotesque discord of that confectionery simile nor has mrs atherton any more notion of structure than of ornament in fiction she has that terrible habit of beginning at the beginning the substance of the californians for instance consists in the varying relations of one man with two girls friends he falls in and out of love with each of them in turn and there is a good deal of play of temperament upon temperament a good deal of emotional crisis in the process this is all well enough but to get to this you have to work through a hundred pages of local colour and if you please a biography from childhood of the two young ladies in question all because mrs atherton does not know how to set the puppets working without it it was just the same in patience sparhawk it was just the same in american wives and english husbands tolerable the first time the device becomes irritating by repetition and yet when all is said and done mrs athertons are good novels you  pish  and  pshaw  for a while and then you feel that she is getting a hold on you her people are vigorously conceived and what is more they are interesting and they grow develop under circumstances furthermore she has an undeniable power of creating strong situations here is an example helena has taken magdalenas lover from her and after a short engagement throws him over she comes to tell magdalena that she has found him to he a man with an impure past magdalena knew this the knowledge the womans desire to save had been an element in her love for him her nerves are overwrought to the point of trying to kill her friend helena paused abruptly and caught her breath she had felt magdalena extend her arm and stealthily open a drawer in the bureau beside her chair there was nothing remarkable in the fact for in that drawer magdalena kept her handkerchiefs nevertheless helena shook with the palsy of terror the cold sweat burst from her body in the intense darkness she could see nothing only a vague patch where the face of magdalena was the silence was so strained that surely a shriek must come tearing across it the shriek came from her own throat she leapt to her feet like a panther reached the door in a  bound fled down the hall and the stair her eyes glancing wildly over her shoulder and so out to her horse it is many years since that night but there are silent moments when that ride through the woods flashes down her memory and chills her skinthat mad flight from an unimaginable horror through the black woods on a terrified horse the shadow of her fear racing just behind with outstretched arms and clutching fingers helenas sudden flight left magdalena staring through the dark at the spanish dagger in her hand her arm was raised her wrist curved the dagger pointed toward the space which helena had filled a moment ago i intended to kill her she said aloud i intended to kill her thisand this is only one of two or three equally strong scenes in the californiansstrikes us as really dramatic

dipsomania is not new and not agreeable but it is most cleverly worked out in 4a daughter of the vine and what is more important the interest of the story commences at once 4 tyre californians con tains more detail and is altogether a more elaborate piece of work among women who have written american novels mrs atherton probably holds a position hardly contested by any rival there are however a good many modern english women novelists with whose method and style hers might be compared she secures an advantage over these ladies in the novelty and picturesqueness of the life and scenery with which she deals she is always vivacious and clear she can be sentimental without being mawkish but she seems unable to add the touch of delicacy and tenderness with which a great writer heightens the effect of his most vigorous studies from human nature in concentration of effect 4 a daughter of the vine shows an advance on 4 the californians it is a pity that the authors determination to be trenchant at all costs has led her in the later book to a conclusion which is almost brutal excessive length both of narrative and dialogue goes far to limit the interest of a passing emperor by robert shortz routledge  sons it is a story of life first at the united states military college at west point and afterwards when the hero and his comrade have been expelled in mexicoduring the days of the archduke maximilian otherwise the emperor maximiliano both sections of the book show the same lack of proportion in dealing with matters of detail and the whole volume amounts to little more than a wild story of adventure unsuited to boys as literature solely because there is a want of delicacy nearly amounting to impropriety in various places fighting and military movements are described with the same care and interest that appear in the same writers story of the days of napoleon in italy entitled  the gift of bonaparte the author in question now and then uses phraseology which stamps his writing as transatlantic 44the governors expected visit did not materialize your intentions were good though they did not materialize are instances that occur in narrative and dialogue respectively the story is told mostly in the first person by the hero a cadet of the united states army and a campaigner in mexico and the form of narrative adopted is not always successfully maintained we do not think the book ranks high as fiction though it gives promise of more interesting work mrs marshalls place as a writer of tales for the young is vacant and one may reasonably

been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a

the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy

luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the

considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and

and with a dreadful worm always gnawing at his heart have we not said enoughwhat with plain english and what with figures of speechto allow the author to congratulate himself with at least the unequivocal assurance that he has devised an exceedingly sensational story  unfortunately however even the novelreading tastes of this age require something more than this to make it content to own a

larger the maze and the longer the process of threading it the more tedious does the operation become and the more wearisome the bare stone walls in  the man of mark  there are so to speak neither hedges nor arbours its sole plea of interest is the perplexity of its labyrinth even the temple at   vv the end is barely worth getting to and if ones sensation on arriving there is not exactly that a great deal of fuss has been wasted over nothing it is at all events that the goal and the road to it are both of them very unsatisfactory society has such a plethora of novels to choose from nowadays that it has no inducement to encourage those of which the number seems every day increasingwhose only attraction is a wild romance which after all we all know cannot by any possibility be founded on fact we have spoken of two or three exceptions to the general dearth of descriptive power which pervades these volumes on these two or three exceptions we are going to rest a word of serious and friendly advice they are quite enough to prove that the author is capable of far better work than such unsatisfactory stuff as this a pen that can portray incidents with the vigour and truthfulness to human nature with which he follows the supposed murderer in his wild flight or a pen that can sketch so quietly so tenderly with so much genuine pathos good feeling and good taste a happy deathbed

the simple probable and welldigested plot fromn which the author has skilfully composed without any confusion though with great variety a romance of three volumes the peuisal of which becomes more an nmore interestilng as we proceed and which at the conclusion leaves the same sort of impression as is made by a first visit to picturesque spots under agreeable circumstances the images which impress them selves on the mind inspire a wish to conternplate them anew there are somne subordi nate characters in the work which give great animation and even a dramatic imprint to the whole romance the two valets roque and peregil though ini some respects alike have yet a distinguishing shade in their comic character thlis latter quality which is perhaps rather too freely indulged in in certain passages is comm1onl under different points of view to the old duenna who attends upon theodora to lisarda the femme de chamber of leonora and to rufa marien a renegado woman the wife of one of the servants of the petty king caneri by a judicious mixture of the comic and the serious sometimes perhaps a little outr6 but nevtr misplaced the contrast of different situations is skilfully managed the events are made to succeed each other rapidity but without any jumble  the characters are strongfly marked powerfully supported and all distinct and well adapted to produce general as well as individual effect and finally the plan would have left us nothinr to wish for if in conjunction with the force energy and vivacity of its pictures it occasionally united m1ore pathos and tenderness passing from an examination of the general plan to that ot some of its details we may bie allowed to point out certatin little negligences excusable it is true in the first attelpt of a young author who is carried away by the strength and impetuosity of his imagination and the sunerabundance of his resources nay more perhaps these very defects are the inseparalle conditions of those masterstrokes of the pencil which originate rather in inspiration than in the cold dictates of reason yet it appears to us that a few of these faults might easily have been avoided they do not originate in want of talent as we have clearly show n for instance when theodora s saved by aguilar how is it that he does not think of sending her to her father monte blanco with whom he is acquainted rather than to his own laturhter leonora at grenala  a natural intimation of stich a wish or a half declaration of how thecidora vas sit uated with regard to her father would have been sificient to have removled this scruiple whidi is sture to arise in the mind of the reader when omez arias and gespedec are fihfitincg in the zangaan or court yard el monlte blancos house how is it that he forgtfusl of the laws of chivalrv does

conimonplace but in that case whly not have made him die repentant  wvhy not have restored hnin to reason when his rage for vengeance was tgiatified and dissipated we inav be rnistaken but yet we hesitate not to assert that we consider this the only defect in the otherwise admirably drawn character of the renegade which 1s perhaps the best it the work up to the last scene bermudo contrives to excite our inteest even by his ferocity but when we behold him dying in all the madness of despair we cannot avoid feeling horrified considered only as a romance gomez arias is constructed with surprising skill and with inlgenuity nearly approaching7 to perfection and thls perhaps if not the first requisite in the class to which it belongs is at least that which is mnost difficult of attainment whiclh makes us augur favourably of the authors future compositions considered however as an historical romance and msith reference to the qualities which we have painted olt as essential to works of that class gomez arias leaves us something more to desire nv cuspcct that this arises froin the choice of subject which enters rather too much into the cllass of events belonging exciusively to private life treated as it has been by caideron under the title of nina de gomez arias it is hiiihly interesting upon the stage  but three interest which we seek in an historical romance should he of a more 4teneral and elevated nature our author has nevertheless greatly improved upon calderon thourh lie has perhaps followved him rather too closely in the arrangement of his lian sgomez arias is extremely criminal but lhe is riot so odious as he is represented in the drama hiis perfidy his cruelty to theodora obscure his brilliant qualities but these occasionally shine forth so as to excite our esteem and to inspire us rather with pity than with disgust for him calderon places the moors upon the scene merely as the vile instruments that bring about the abandonment of theodora but in this romanice we see them playing a princifal part their cause if not fully developed is at least understood we behold them acting lik brave men and though they may not be quite worthy of the party and the rights which they defend yet the reader can discover very justifiable motives for feeling interested concerning them in a word the historical portion of the romance is well digested anl properly connected with the inventive part but history is made subordinate to the romance instead of the romance bein subordinate to the history which ought iu our inion to be the case besides the lisadvaritatres attendant on the sulject itself e ughit also to remember that this first rebellion1 of the moors is perhaps one of the least important episodes in the history of spainat any rate according to the manner il which it is related by the writeri of that period  the grave and impllartial mendoza justly styles it  rebelion de salteadoresthe rebellion of the briyands and certainly the chiefs who figured in thins first revolt were all of obscure rank and several of thern of despicable character it was not till afterwvards in the time of philip ii thait the mloorish rebellions became really serlous affairs and no doubt if our author had chosen that epoch his genius would inevitably have led liln to develop a miuch more importailt plot for an historical romance  e cannot however ielp regrettingy that in the present instance hle has not shown us the generous isabella struggling as some historians unfortunately but too little known have represented her with the emotions of her own heart divided between her love of justice and the counsels of fanaticism with which her timorous conscience was alarmedand the sonmbre and malevolent policy of her husband ferdinand who annoyed there so much whenever there was any question respecting the issuing of intolerant decrees or giving orders for the lersecution of the jews atnd the mloors anrd more especially when the establishment of the inquisition became the subject of debate we should have liked to have seen this sovereign sopported in hier generous views by the brave aguilar wvho if he had been appointed to a place in the queens council mitht have favoured the just demands of the maoors at the same time that he would have been ready to figiht against them in case of their revolt we should like to have seen gonmez arias carried away by his armbitioln assisting the rebel aloo rs whose cause really offered so fine a pretext to a man of an aspiring character such are oui views of these matters perhaps from the too exalted idea which we had formed of an historical romarnce but still wve inust confess that gomez arias such as it is possesses strong claimis to that rank the characters of theodora and tde renegade bermudo are alone sufficient to ensure it praise to which very few writers can pretend theodora is unaffected virtuous interesting tender imlpassioned innocent confidingr and generous and it is precisely these good qualities which render hier eminently ulnhap1y bernmudo resembles a powverul genius who weighs arnd decides the fate of the hero of theronmance his character is powerfully conceived ably sustained and fine even to time end  w icked and sibline vindictive and generious cruel and tender he acts always like an extraordinary being and yet always according to nature we would gladly quote the two beautiful chapters in which hle relates his own history ai d in wvhich he reveals his plans to theodora and succeeds in persuading her that he will prove her deli ere he who apparently has only favoured the brutal views of a despot by receiving her fiom gomez arias and placinr her at the meyrey of caneri wte nmust however content ourselves with

we mean some unusual facility in catching the niceties of lropriety could enable the author to steer clear tihe whole production has as little as possible the air of a foreign performance but rather

such success prove the possession of intellectual vigourthough of a kind perhaps not very valuable if indeed of any to society nor except exerted in particular directions and that depending on the fashion of the timesvery serviceable to the individual the highest attainable success can scarcely place the niost laborious student completely on a level with even the uncultivated native if there were such a thing as universality of genius the same labour spent upon some art or science might work up a man into distinction but probably the superior person in one line would make but a very poor figure in another with his utmost exertions after all the trial can scarcely ever be madeor the fact establiahedfor distinction in one pursuit swallows up a life the tale itself is one mixed up of profligacy and revenge gomez the hero is another don juan prompted by ambition after a series of successful adventures gomez is engaged on legitimate terms to a lady the heiress of the richest and noblest family in spain and the marriage is delayed only from the necessity of a temporary abdene while the life of a rival wounded by him in a recent encounter is yet in danger in this little interval he meets with another lady the sole daughter of a noble house whom he tempts fiom her home and in a few days growing weary of his prize leaves on a mountain sleeping from fatigue under the protection of a servant  with instructions to take her on waking to a neighbour ing convent whither he himself was pro ceeding to make preparations for her recep tion and abandon her for ever scarcely how ever is he out of sight when a party of marauding moors come upthe servant flies and the lady is conveyed to the moorish chief it was in the reign of isabella and the moors were again after the capture of grenada in rebellion the chief delighted with the prize would have taken inmmediate advantage of his good fortune but for the oplposition of a renegado companion who recognises the lady and

nothing for it but dissemiblinglhe promises to break off the said marriage and conduct herself the very next night to her fathers and make her an honest womanand on the faith of this promise the lady with the dagger contentedly withdraws day at length dawns upon the heros perplexity and he demands of the father and next of the bride a days delay under some unsatisfactory pretence while conferring with his servant on the means of extricating from his embarrassments the renegado comes up and overhearing the conversation undertakes at once to relieve him ar rangements are consequently made and in the night he conducts his victim to a place pointed out by the renegado where he finds the aforesaid moorish chief and according to agreement with all possible coolness delivers her into his hands and his servant also upon his reclamation against this act of villainy thus rid of his embarrassment he flies back to the bride to solicit the immediate performance of the ceremony but the young ladys pride is upsomne private communications also had enlightened her a little on the subject of the putting offand she in her turn demands a lelaya month a yearan indefinite pleriod meanwhile the moors rebel again gonmez has hinmself the commani of the spanish forces and quickly routing the rebels he returns in triumlph to receive the welcome of his sovereign and as he fondly hopes the now not unwilling hand of his offended bride  unluckily the first object which meets his gaze is theodora her father and his own servant the queen makes short work in the business of justice she insists upon instant satisfaction lie is compelled to marry theodora on the spot  and the next monient is committed to prison on a charge of high treason for consorting with moorsfor he had delivered personally histheodora into the hands of the moor chief anl all intercourse with mloors was expressly prohibited lie is readily convicted and sentenced to lie the queen is inflexible  but fortunately a noble courtier now on his deathbed holds a pledge of favour from the queen and this pledge he puts into theodoras hiands who immediately demands the fullilmient and gomez is thus rescued on the very scaffold by his injured but devoted wife lfroni the scaffold he is conducted to the queens court where he was eagerly expectedtlhe qu een herself was delighted at his escape tfr he had done goo1

nevertheless by means of the nuumrous extracts which we have intermingled vvith it be sufficient to give a edear idea of the literaiy merit of the work which is now before tis thc subject eif ionic

the title of au historical romance a title assumed by the author himself and does it fulfil all the conditions reepiisite in this new department of composition inveuted by sir walter scott tin principal object of the historical romance is aecording to the opinion of the best critics thc representation of the manners and sentiments of a whole peoplethe picture of a peculiar and interesting

object is not to reveal the eerefs of crafty policy or mysterious mamilu rcs bm tu hold forth the moral scene of history and supply the difccts arising from the ignorance and negligenee of annalists a species of logical induction is iiitiidiieed which borders lcs on rriridni than on the power of imagination and brings together a series of general facts which repiiscut the slte of sodetv by means of

ought only to bc oeomltry to the cxhi bition of the manners and opinions of a particular period this picture of society which is the first and most indispensable condition of the historical romance the author of  ioniez arias has not adeiuately fulfilled this production strikes more by the ingenious contrivances of the situations and by the mit ti ml display of the sentiments of the heart than by the depth and accuracy of its delineations of thc moorish and spanish parties that in the times of isabella disputed the possession of spain riie seat of the insurrection is in the mountains of thc alpujarras the author describes its progress and its fury but be neglects to trace out the causes that gave it birth hut does the author while he exhibits no strom partiality in favour of the spaniards seem apprehensive of betraying thc secret to us that justice and liberty were arrayed under the banners of the mustilmaiis  iksides his description of the court of isabella is exhibited only in profile and don tclesforo de trueba in our opinion would have iloite much better in devoting to the delineation of the character of that great queen or of her brilliant court those pages which he employs in rehearsing the long dialogues that pass between the loiuacious chambermaid of leonor and the unhappy theodora frankness and sincerity ure a tribute which criticism delights to pay to real talent  and the value that is set upon a work is evinced by noticing whatever faults present themselves in its page such are our feelings and opinion after the perusal of  ionic arias  and in conclusion we may observe that if the production of don tclesforo tlc trueba deserves not to be ranked among historical romances it may occupy a ditiuguished place bv the side of those works which like the  matilde of madame cottin hold an intermediate muk between the department that has originated with walter scott and that which has been illustrated by lc sage,war_contra

B4490,['9517004'],  a diversity of creatures if we had any misgivings strengthened by some recent excursions in journalism that decadence had set in with mr kip ing ths new book puts them to rest he has never shown himself a greater master of the art of storytelling never combined creative imagination with more triumphant realism or handled his own english prose with more ease economy and certainty of effect the first of the fourteen as easy as abc is perhaps the finest short story of the future ever written a sort of sequel to  with the night amail it is dated ad 2065 and is an historical episode in a world that has a diversity of creatures by rudyard kipling macmillan  co 6s passed through the most profound and complete of social revolutions politics have ceased no human being takes any interest in government for all things run smoothly and in perfect order under a small and unobtrusive aerial board of control which leaves absolute privacy and security to the individual  transportation is civilization democracy is disease in such a world crowds and the people are the one source of evil and a sporadic outbreak of now obsolete and mediaeval democratic agitation in chicago arouses a storm of agoraphobia and brings about the events to be narrated mr kipling does not describe but makes the readers imagination vividly realize the wonders of aerial navigation the groundcircuits and the destructive soundvibrations and withering rays of light which are the defences and the artillery of the future he moves among these sensations as if they were the commonplaces of existence as if mankind had been used to them for generations his is a realism that swift might have envied some artists excel in giving an air of the marvellous and stupendous to things that really exist such is mr pennell in his romantic pictures of colossal buildings engines and machinery others like mr muirhead bone can make the most incredible structures and implements of war matters of everyday familiarity mr kipling can do both he can make the ordinary ultraromantic he can let us feel at home in a world where everything is new strange and astounding to him romance is a plaything which he handles with the skill and ease of a tennis champion brandishing a racket though none of the other stories travels into the word of mechanical wonders several perhaps most would in cold analysis seem quite as improbable in three the dog hervey  in the same boat and  swept and garnished occult sympathies some form of telepathic bond or a faculty of seeing the invisible are rendered more than credible by like realistic devices there are farces such as  the vortex  the horse marines and  the village that voted the earth was flat which pile situation on ludicrous situation and climax on climax long after it seems as if the final limit of extravagance had been reached the lastnamed story is a piece of uproarious comedy that exceeds  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney and has the advantage of being laid in the home counties and enacted by local magnates villagers city men and mps such as we all know the success with which the inventor brings off his daring complications of humorous circumstance is not a whit less amazing than that of his  easy as abc it is in fact all as easy as abc to mr kipling and that is perhaps what chiefly enthrals the discriminating reader and seizes our admiration for it is the manner not the matter of these latest masterpieces which challenges attention mr kipling offers nothing conspicuously new various as the contents are we are well acquainted with their different kinds he set the direction in every instance years ago the only wonder is that he is able to proceed still farther in every one true there is nothing of the same kind of imagination as in they or the brushwood boy this set contains no story having the fundamental seriousness of several earlier ones that cling to memory but as a craftsman and something higher than a craftsman mr kipling has gone on developing though he is not a novelist his characterdrawing is substantial enough to last out the different events of many stories stalky and beetle reappear here and the former has obviously lived there are also some sikhs and goorkhas reminiscent of kim and other indian stories perhaps it is a result of the war that infractions of the sixth commandment are treated with such sangfroid and nonchalance in  friendly brook and  the edge of the evening each story is followed by a kind of epilogue in verse which sometimes explains a rather cryptic meaning or at least enforces its bearing as mr kipling conceives it the land  is an excellent history of the british peasant who was there when the romans came and still is in real possession for whoever pays the taxes old mus hobden owns the land but the average quality of the verse is low some pieces such as  the children in spite of a swinburnian measure and fluent doublerhyming are merely consecutive lengths of prose we should like to have quoted from that charming comedy of schoolboy humours and howlers  regulus to show what mr kipling can do in the way of platon c as well as other dialogue he is firstrate on the teaching of latin and its effect on living but to open the book anywhere is to see that he is a supreme master of style in all its applications,war_contra
