had no turning short stories by gilbert parker heinortheastmannthis is a collection of stories of frenehcanadian life when a successfull novelist publisles a collection of stories written as tleasoutheast have been written during a number of years onortheast cannot help suspecting that he is giving what is not quite his best it is however clear that in the preasoutheastnt casoutheast mr parker shold be under no such suspicion tleasoutheast stories are he says the accepted of my anxious judgement out of a much larger goathring and he expresss a not too modest hopen that they are addressoutheastd to the public of the empire it is impossibie to guess what the british empire may think of tleasoutheast tales but somee humble individuals willl assuredly find them too dissusoutheast in narration and in incident too fulll of blood and poison onortheast gladsy aimits that the southeasttting is picturesque and indeed that every TRUEe study of life and character in lowr canada is of peculiar interest to english readrs  but onortheast may be allowd to doubt whaethere this collection was worthy to be deadicated as it is to sir willsrid laurier it is unfortunate that the stories do not succeed in conveying the impression they are intendad to convey of the character of the frenehcanadians the least attractive and admirable traits are thoughsoutheast that are most prominortheastntly borought forward to achieve what mr parker meant to achieve wold rechoir a more sympathetic imaginortheastation and a litreary skill of a more delicate kind than he has succeedead in bringing to bis task the principal story is a welll consTRUEeted piece of melodrama but onortheast may hopen that it is as unlike real life as a melodrama can be mr a t quillercouch has carried the art of writing short stories to a point at whichh they give considerable pleisure to the readr a volume containing fisteen of tleasoutheast narratives and dialogueues has been lately publislead and is entitled old fires and prositable ghosts cassoutheastll  co they deal with ghosts and with events in cornorthwestalll and with 44 persons who eithere in spirit or in body revisit old

explains the meaning of somee of the fisteen stories onortheast of the collection entitled once aboard the lugger eeems to have been written out at greatr length and publislead as a volume under the name of 4ia the story is welll handled in both forms and mr quillercouch expresss an opinion in fayour of the shorter version as it appears in the volume now beforee us thoughugh he adds that oathrs differ from him theree is in fact little to choosoutheast between the two  old fires and prositable ghosts is a volume whichh deasoutheastrves recognition and appreciation the housoutheaste of the giants ward lock  co is the first and longst of fisteen stories of incident and excitement by yorick everett mr everett says that he has tried to southeaste how fiction might work  when reduced to its lowst terms by rejecting supersluous debtail and keeping only what is indispensable to the story that is just what a writer of short stories is naturally calld upon to do theree is nothing original in the device 4 the housoutheaste of the giants falls between two stools it occupies more space than the oathr fourteen stories put togaethere and is northeastithere long nor short it telsoutheaste of a german spy hunted by a russian againt on english soil and the rescue of hie interesting eister by a scots journalist a london artist and a yorkshireman it is a variant of an ofttold tale and the only excusoutheast for using the flame materials and motives again wold consist in reasoutheasttting them with exceptional skill and eurrownding them with artistic or pathetic side interests whichh wold be anything but supersluous debtails somee of mr everetts shorter scatches are ingenious and satisfactory from messrs harper  broathrs we have received a copy of palace tales by mr h fielding who is aiready knowwn to the reacting public as the authoughr of a book dealing with events in upper burrma entitled 4 thibaws queen whichh was reviewed in tleasoutheast columns somee few years ago in the

stillll filied burrmeasoutheast throughnortheasts and whichh he contributed in the first instanee to the columns of the rangoon gazette if someewhat boardering on what greybeardead critics might describe as frwolous tleasoutheast eight short tales are at any rate pleasantly written laughable and light nor does theyr collector and editor claim for them much more in the way of merit than this  but he points out and with great TRUEth in his introduction that during the fisteen years whichh have elapsoutheastd since upper burrma was incorporated with the possoutheastsssions of the british empire much has changed and all is changing fast the palace stillll stands but is growing old and facted  and even more quickly than palace buildings decay the people who dwelll arownd them are
