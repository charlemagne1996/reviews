B3378,"['8868540', '6657197']",  memoirs of a highland lady literature edited by lady strachey murray we were once shown a picture by raeburn of an elderly scotchman an elderly scotch gentlewoman and a beautiful scotch girl they were said the owner an uncle who had fought under clive his maiden sister and their nieceall johnstones of alva if memory serves aright that group has been recalled by this most charming book which like the picture suggests a scotch jane austen much more janeaustenish than susan ferrier its author elizabeth grant was born in edinburgh may 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in bombay cathedral to col afterwards general henry smith of baltiboys lived thereafter in ireland and died november 16th 1885 she was the eldest of the five childrentwo sons and three daughtersof sir john peter grant of eothiemurchus 1774  1848 by his english wife jane ironside whose father was a long  descended clergyman at houghtonle spring sir john peter the only son of a doctor had succeeded in 1790 to the rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle he was an edinburgh advocate and london barrister sat as whig member for grimsby and tavistock and in 1827 having frittered away his 2000 a year and gone bankrupt was appointed a judge in bombay and knighted later he was chief justice at calcutta these memoirs written by mrs smith for her children during 184567 come down only to 1830 and record her life in london at thorley hall hertfordshire at the doune in rothiemurchus on speyside at university college oxford of which dr james griffith one of her numberless cousins was master in london again in edinburgh and in india they have already been privately printed and now are generously given to the world with a brieftoo briefintroduction by a niece lady strachey no book of the kind has proved more delightful  if ever i write a novel mrs smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten inspector and received 40 in return that rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel as it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past here is one that is truly wordsworthian the young people were not of rothiemurchus they lived up in glen feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married he was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man i am not sure which but his business was to mind a large hock that pastured on the mountainsat the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty the wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening she would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  my goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  ay but i like the bite replied the creature the book is not purely highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown the future lady byron burnss bonnieleslie one of the cleverest women of her age mrs thrale catalani mrs siddons sir augustus deete the original we believe of harry richmonds father basil hall john clerk of eldin jeffrey canning the abbe sieves and many more emerge and disappear in connexion with prince augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty still after all we like the highland folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it the account of the old edinburgh society is entertaining she classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary she met all varietiesthe jeffreys sir david brewster  the crazy lord buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of queen marys and a bone of james the fifth harry erskine john clerk of eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and sir walter himself there is also a welldrawn portrait of canning whom she met in holland she is most fearless in confessing her opinions she confesses that she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  a coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the dukes arms at dunkeld to blair during the summer season the announcement read as follows pleasing intelligence the duchess of athol starts every morning from the  dukes arms at eight oclock the other is told of lord eldin  some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the west country celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument  wi an epitaph said john clerk in his broadest border

B5277,"['8880211', '6788507']",  the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,biography

of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort

of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of

B5097,"['8993792', '2867530', '4341412', '4987878']",  untold the last of the saxon kings loudon saturday june 17 1848 reviews by the athor of rienzi  the last of the barons c 3 vols bentley x will be a misfortune attending the criticism of this new and in many respects able work of sir e bulwer ly ton that those who write on itand indeed those who read itcan scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction if as history it is written with too much of the air of mere invention if as fiction it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler this is an evil attending the choice of the subjectand one which though many have made the attempt only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome to this rare and almost wonderful exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer but we must add that even in that case the experiment however generally successful occasioned many important distortions and perversions of factsand we will venture to say that it has produced especially in the present generation much doubt confusion and error as to characters opinions and events these observations are in a manner challenged by sir e b lyttons dedicatory preface and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes they appear to set up a claim for his fiction notwithstanding his denial of the pretension to the dignity and importance of history we hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily either let us have a production of mere fancy or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards the author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidentshe makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between harold and edith we admit at once that for his purpose he had 1 reason for making the changebecause itrenders the story not merely more interesting but on every account more readable on this point sir e b lytton observes  the love tory of harold nnd edith is told differently from the wellknown legend which implies a leis pure connexion but the whole legend respecting the edeva faira edith the fair whose name meets us in the doomsday roll rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal but which on many accounts i hope may be entrusted fearlessly to the young that is to wy he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawingroom tables and the boudoirs of he ordinary readers of such productions we should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities from hich he clearly means it to be inferred that n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done sobut we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive his archaegy spoils his book as a fictionjust as his departures from the same injure it as history he has thus put a curb on his imagination both regardspersons and eventsand would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints as it is the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader we may be surprised that he can do so well thus loaded but feel sure that he could have done much better unencumbered in fact the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination the description for instance of all that relates to the war of harold against gryffyth in wales is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen we will select our first specimen from this part of vol ii premising that gryffyth his queen and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness and that harold by a monk and a young norman has sent them a message of mercy on submission  as the monk ceased the thrill of the audience was perceptible and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur as if to constrain the king then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man the red spot flushed the dark cheek and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow he made one stride towards thc monk and said in a voice loud and deep and slow rolling far up the hillmonk thou hast said and now hear the reply ofthe son of llewellyn the true heir of roderic the great who from the heights of eryri saw all the lands

he deems us hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of snowdon illume their pinions to share  rash man and unhappy cried the monk what curse drawest thou down on thy head wilt thou be the murderer of thy men in strife unavailing and vain  heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed be dumb hush thy screech lying raven exclaimed gryffyth his eyes darting tire and his slight form dilating  once priest and monk went before us to inspire not to daunt and our cry alleluia  was taught us by the saints ofthe church on the day when saxons fierce and many as harolds fell on the field of maesgarmon no the curse is on the head of the invader not on those who defend hearth and altar yea as the song to the bard the cursk leaps through my veins and rushes forth from my lips by the land they have ravaged by the gore they have spilt on these crags our last refuge below the earn on yon heights where the dead stir to hear mei launch the curse of the

to the last the ploughshare may pass over our cities but the soil shall be trod by our steps and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards nor in the great judgement day shall any race but the race of cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth to answer for the sins of the brave so impressive the voice so grand the brow and sublime the wild gesture of the king as he thus spoke that not only the monk himself was awed  not only though he understood not the words did the norman knight bow his head as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloudbut even the sullen and widespreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment but the spearmen and multitude above excited by the tidings of safety to life and worn out by repeated defeat and the dread fear of famine too remote to hear the king were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators creeping from rank to rank and already they begun to sway and move and sweep slowly down towards the king recovering his surprise the norman again neared gryffyth and began to reurge his mission of peace but the chief waived him back sternly and said aloud though in saxon no secrets can pass between harold and me thus much alone take thou back as answeri thank the earl for myself my queen and my people noble have been his courtesies as foe as foe i thank himas king defy the torque he hath returned to my hand he shall see again ere the sun set messengers ye aro answered withdraw and speed fast that we may pass not your steps on the road the monk sighed and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there that the king was alone in his fierce defiance then lifting again the rood he turned away and with him went the norman the above and nearly all that belongs to it is inventionand very admirably invented it is we know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the catking as gryftyth is called by the norman his struggles his defeats and his suffering we venture to think that sir e b lytton w much mistaken when he represents not merely the clergy but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the confessor as well acquainted with the literature of greece and rome it is true that as regards abbots and monks he is in compensation very severe he does justice to such ecclesiastics as lanfranc and aclred but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of latinwhile a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior the following is a short part of their dialogue  the kings norman favourites at least honoured the church that is true said an abbot 4 and an it were not for two things i should love the norman better than the saxon what are they my father asked an aspiring young monk inprints quoth the abbot proud of the one latin word he thought he knew but that as we see was an error they cannot speak so as to be understood and i fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning here was a sanctified groancount william himself spoke to me in latin  continued the abbot raising his eyebrows did he wonderful  exclaimed several voices and what did you answer holy fathermarrysaid the abbot solemnly i replied inprinisgood said the young monk with a look of profound admiration we have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes even of gryftyth the catking of wales we are told that his mind had turned from the literature of rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land nnd other personages both saxon and norman refer to greek and latin authors with fur too much familiarity homeric fables and homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our anglosaxon forefathers than has by many been supposed yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from horace into the mouth of a young soldierstill more that he should employ such in conversation with a rude saxon from the weald of kent of course what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection  and whether it did or did not require to be translated in ad 1052 it is quite clear that sir e b lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in ad 1848for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into english whatever might be the case in england in the eleventh century wo are sure that greek was not studied in italy even in thc thirteenth centuryand that dante knew nothing of homer unless at secondhand in connexion with this matter we may here not unfitly notice the great number of saxon and anglosaxon words employed by sir e b lytton without explanation even where explanation seemed most necessary if the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of  harold to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors so much thc better  but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation in brackets or otherwise  provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant but generally we think he will be quite at a loss for the meaning we copy a fewand but a fewregarding which we are confident even welleducated persons will be at some loss weregeld lithtmen ceorl suhcendinen cyst mane uses dour cnehts quern  which with many more are of perpetual occurrence we say nothing of such words as thegn which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thaneor of zemmes which sir e b lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gemsbut we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment the author seems to have crammed himself from mr deyncourts folios as he admits in his prefatory epistleand then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others this is an ordinary error the great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out for this reason we tell him that northeast is not to suppose because he sees in a plan of london of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears and because the sport may be mentioned by fitzstephen that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century his mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting but not a very accurate description of london before the conquest in his first volume the truth is that we have no sufficient materials for such a description and on this account we are willing to take sir e b lyttons fanciful representation which is highly picturesque he is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources one instance to the contrary may however be pointed out near the end of his second volume where william then count or dukeof normandy challenges harold to bend his bowan exertion to which the saxon noble is not accustomed and which therefore he declines the meaning of bending a bow is not as sir e b lytton seems to imagine the pulling of a clothyard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung it is stringing a bow an operation requiring both art and strength and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful of the story itself we have said little because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in historyif history it deserve at that early date to be called the loves of harold and edith form but a small portion of the tale and as that is the most imaginative portion so iu several respects it is the best the character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn  and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by and contrasted with the more masculine proportions and appearance of hilda her magical and mysterious grandmotherwho from first to last acts a very prominent part in all that relates to harolds affection and to his ambition she is a very grand personage who adheres to the saxon faith rejecting the christian creed and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious it must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of norna in sir w scotts  pirate and of meg merrilies in his  guy mannering but it is only for a momentand in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author what follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and hilda are introduced in the second volume   there is no joy for me returned edith plaintively and i have that on my heart she added with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone  which at last i will dare to speak i reproach thee hilda that thou hast marred all my life that thou hast duped me with dreams and let me alone in despair speak on said hilda calmly as a nurse to a froward child hast thou not told me from the first dawn of my wondering reason that mv life and lot were interwoven withwith the word mad and daring must out with those of harold the peerless  but for that which my fancy took from thy lips as a law i had never been so vain and so frantic i had never watched each play of his face and treasured each word from his lips i had never made my life but a part of his lifeall my soul but the shadow of his sun but for that i had hailed the calm of the cloisterbut for that i had glided in peace to my grave and nownow o hilda edith paused and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command and she resumed quickly thou knowest that these hopes were but dreamsthat the law ever stood between him and meand that it was guilt to love him i knew the law answered hilda but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird ye are sibbe to each other some five times removed and therefore an old man at rome saith that ye ought not to wed when the shavelings obey the old man at rome and put aside their own wives and frillas and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl i will stoop to hear of their lawswith disrelish it may be but without scorn it is no sin to love harold and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together form and heart hilda hilda madden me not with joy cried edith starting up in rapturous emotion her young face dyed with blushes and all her renovated beauty so celestial that hilda herself was almost awed as if by the vision of freya the northern venus charmed by a spell from the halls of asgard  but that day is distant renewed the vaia what mattera what matters cried the pure child of nature i ask but hope enoughoh enough if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave  lo then said hilda behold the sunfthts dawns again as she spoke the vaia stretchy her arm and through the intersticed columns of th fane edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward presently into the space of the eire came harold her beloved his face was pale jjiv grief yet recent but perhaps more than everdiiajv was in his step and command on his brow for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of saxon england and what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soulthon comest said hilda in the hour i predicted atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star vak1 said harold gloomily  i will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements  or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture the earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of earl godwin and his four sons from banishment and the declaration by harold of his love for edithwho as we have seen stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him the incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volumeand the interest is powerfully wound up in the third they therefore who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied let them wait until they have finished the whole and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work it is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact such in a degree is the case with harold in various parts of that story he is not so much its hero as william duke of normandy the victor at hastings and sir e b lytton has drawn the character of william with such force and fullness that when ht and harold are together it is not to be disputed that william attracts more attention if not interest than his younger rival we do not say that the affections of the reader are not with harold but the genius the resources the mental power and subtlety of william engross our admirationand would make us feel certain even if we knew nothing historically of the issue that he must triumph we admit all along the courage and generosity of harold but as the author tells us his parts are comparatively slowand when in normandy he was outwitted and would have been more so hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew haco this may be true as history bot it is not right as artand here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel we cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped and who we know in the end will be conquered  iarold the last of the saxon kings in three volumes london bentley 1848 it is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work nor is it necessary so to do sir bulwver lytton is not a new aspirant after literary honours but as we had long since been given to understand that he had made his last appearance before the literary world the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited the present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit cast long back in our history the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the norman invasion and accordingly having done so he has rendered the subject completely his own and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history the auce was one fraught with interest as being the last hours of the old saxon mnonarchy the legend of harold and edith is related but differently to the received opinion concerning it and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public into whose hands such a work may naturally be expected to faul superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought about but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the narratives of these timesthey were believed in thought to have a part in every action of life so that unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our saxon forefathers no terror is sought to be inepired by these ghostly aids they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency the author has succeeded in portraying a very beautiful character in edith she is firm noble and affectionate loving wvith an unselfish love that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested not by basking in the enjoyment it affords butt where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine her love for harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake even though it brought her all she coveted on earththe desire to be near him harold is a very fine creation admirably sustained throughout we may on the whole pronounce harald to be one of the most striking of sir bulwer lyltons ever striking novels there is something highly classical in the style which tells at once of the bent of the atithors mind and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomed  harold the last ofthe saxon kinqa vy sir e bulwer lytton london bentley 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle sir edward flulwer lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement he also threatens us with a series of similar stories in which the earlier history of england is to be done into romance4 furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old english morals men and manners and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellowcountrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by professed historians and chroniclers a man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of pelhamn we can scarcely conceive that one who looks upon pelham as a gentleman upon the last days of pomopeii as a elaaical story and upon lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue should also look upon himself as brmed to somprobend the motie of th dark and the mediaeval ages is perhaps not a thing to create much surprise but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever if indeed the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of harold as we have found it ourselves we have small fear for the result if they smile with us at the authors pedantry at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader at the benevolence with which he translates a latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned at the hodgepodge of old phraseology and the style of the chroniclers intermingled with the true bulwerian sentiment and language at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of norman french saxon technicalities and names of common objects and cant ejaculations if they yawn with us over the authors tedious historical disquisitions over the ossianic raptures of hilda and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations and the literary references which thickly strew his pages if besides all this they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which with whatever personal weaknesses was the animating spirit of the confessorking we have little expectation that the world will petition sir edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history or to turn the events of our annals into a salmngundi of truth ard falsehood from all this our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of harold the last of the saxon kings a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of july in truth we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance but with little pleasure and no interest here and there indeed the story becomes more lively and brilliant and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author especially towards the terniination when sir edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist and writes like a man of common sense his tale becomes more readable and lifelike until all at once with the beginning of some new chapter the style of the modern novelist is laid aside and a foolish bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention we need scarcely say that sir e b lyttons ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect he writes as much nonsense about plriests and monks and relics and churchservices as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about jesuits and convents his portraits of such mien as king edward and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic the scene of the monarchs deathbed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity we ever were fated to read it will please and edify our readers to see sir edwards ideas as to how a christian king dies  the king lay for some moments silent but evidently striving to recollect his thoughts meanwhile the two arch prelates bent over him stigand eagerly alred fondly then raising himself on one arm while with the other he pointed to harold at the foot of the bed the king said  your hearts i see are with harold the earl so be it je loctroi at these words he fell back on his pillow a loud shriek burst from his wifes lips all crowded around he lay as the dead at the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall he made his way abruptly to the bedside and said chidingly  air give him air the throng parted the leech moistened the kings pale lips with the cordial but no breath seemed to come forth no pulse seemed to beat and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood the rest descended the dais and hatened to depart harold only remained but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed  the crowd had gained the centre of the hall when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstepthe sound of the kings voice loud terribly distinct and full as with the vigour of youth restored all turned their eyes appalled all stood spellbound there mate the king upright on the bed his face men above the kneeling prelates and his eyes bright and shining down the hail  yyu he odd dellberatelyi ea ts shall be a nl vision or a sale malon pant me almigbty one the power of speech to tell it he aused a

off be carried away yet move of itself to the ancient trunk unite to the stem bud out with the blossom and stretch forth its fruit so said the monks and even now ere i spoke i saw them again there standing mute and with the paleness of dead men by the side of my bed  these words were said so calmly and as it were so rationally that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone a shudder passed through the assembly and each man shrunk from the kings eye which seemed to each man to dwell on himself suddenly that eye altered in it cold beam suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent t the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect the whole face to work with horror the arms stretched forth the form writhed on the couch distorted fragments from the older testament rushed from the lips  seyuelac  sa eac the lake of blood shrieked forth the dying king i the lord bath bent his bows the lord bath bared is sword he comes down as a warrior to war and his wrath is in the steel and the flame lie boweth the mountains and comes down and darkness is under his feet v as if revived but for these tremendous denunciations as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed the eyes set and the king fell a corpse in the arms of harold in an earlier stage of the tale a similarly exquisite picture of the pious monarchs proceedings is given with all our authors felicity and truthtelling correctness veneration for the relics of saints is of course a fertile theme for ridicule throughout the story ania the poor king is painted as ready to sacrifice the lives and i appiness of living thousands for the sake of the bones of the deceased the efforts of the writer to show up the confessor as a drivelling child of superstition are indeed sufficient proof of his inadequacy to the task he has undertaken the following conversation between edward and harold is but one of a whole clas of passages  when the son of leofric had left the chamber the king rose wearily and said in norman french to which language he always yearningly returned when with those who could speak it  beaufrre and bin aimw in what trifles must a king pass his life i and all this while matters grave and

lithsmen murmur at my absence and grievances many and sore have arisen in my exile the king stared in terror and his look was that of a child when about to be left in the dark  nay nay i cannot spare

against whom all thy sm glee of life and death had turned into memories of hyssop and gal   my sister  exclaimed harold in indignant amaze  my sister thy deadliest foe i she who never once murmured at

and are not granted to such as thou dost thou think that in the prime of my manhood i could have youth and beauty forced on my sight and hear mans law and mans voice say  they are thine and thine only and not feel that war was brought to my hearth and a snare set on my bed and that the fiend had set watch on my soul  verily i tell thee man of battle that thou hast known no strife as awful as mine and achieved no victory as hard and as holy and now when my beard is silver anrd the adam of old is expelled at the precincts of death now thinkest thou that i can be reminded of the strife and temptation of yore without bitterness and shame when days were spent in fasting and nights in fierce grayer and in the face of woman i saw the devices of satan   edward coloured as he spoke and his voice trembled with the accents of what seemed hate harold gazed on him mutelv and felt that at last he had won the secret that had ever perplexed him and that in seeking to be above the humanity of love the wouldbe saint had indeed turned love into the hues of hate a thought of anguish and a memory of pain the kling recovered himself in a few momnents and said with some dignity i but god and his

monasteries and the poor and return soon as for algar what sayest thou   i fear me answered the largesouled harold with a victorious effort of justice over resentment  that if you reject his stit you will drive him into some perilous extremes despite his rash and proud spirit he is brave against foes and beloved by the ceorls who oft like best the frank and hasty spirit w herefore some power and

ancta mariathe thumb of st jude in nil jlustice however we must give a quotation or two displuaying the mrore trutiltul and agreeable qualities of tle better parts of the story such an one is the scene whihi followvs describing a saxon dinner of olden das  a monk of the order of st benedict then most in favour ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the abbot who after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek  ah guillaune he exclaimed in the norman tongue  this is indeed a grace for which to sing jubilate thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land ot illcooking and exile  talking of grace my dear father and food said de graville loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a waspfor even at that early 1eriod small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the french continent talking of grace the sooner thou savst it over some friendly refection the more will the latin sound unctuous and musical i have journeyed since daybreak and am now hungered and faint  alack alack cried the abbot plaintively  thou knowest little my son what hardships we endure in these parts how larded our larders and how nefarious our fare the flesh of swine salted  the flesh of beelzebub cried mallet de gravilte aghast  but comfort thee i have stores on my sumptermiulespoulardee and fishes and other not despicable comestibles and a few flasks of wine not pressed laud the saints  from the vines of this country wherefore wilt thou see to it and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer  no cooks have 1 to trust to replied the abbot  of cooking know they here as much as of latin natheless i will go and do my best with the stewpans meanwhile thou wilt at least have rest and the bath for the saxons even in their convents are a clean race and learned the bath from the dane  that i have noted said the knight  for even at the smallest house at which i have lodged in my way from london the host bath eourteonslv offered me the bath and the hostess linen curious and fragrant and to say truth the poor people are hospitable and kind despite their uncouth hate of the foreigner nor is their meat to be despised plentiful and succulent but pardex as thou sayest little helped by the art of dressing wherefore my father i will wile the time till the pomlardes be roasted and the fish broiled or stewed by the ablutions thou pfferaet me i shall tarry with thee some hours for i have much to learn  the abbot then led the sire de graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficientfor both norman and saxon hardy men as they seem to us from afar so shuddered at the touch of cold water that a bath of natural temperature as well as a hard bed was sometimes imposed as a penancethe good father went his way to examine the sumptermules and admonish the muchsuffering and bewildered laybrother who officiated as cookand who speaking neither norman nor latin scarce made out one word in ten of his superiors elaborate exhortations  mallets squire with a change of raiment and goodly coffers of soaps unguents and odours took his way to the knight for a norman of birth was accustomed to much per sonal attendance and had all respect for the body and it was nearly an hour before in a long gown of fur reshaven dainty and decked the sire de graville bowed and sighed and prayed before the refection set out in the abbots cell so the two normans despite the sharp appetite of the lay man ate with great gravity and decorum drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination sel dom more than tasting with looks of patient dissatisfaction each of the comestibles sipping rather than drinking nibbling rather than devouring washing their fingers in rosewater with nice care at the close and waving them afterwards gracefully in the air to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert as if recalling the polished manners of normandy still retained in that desolate exile and their temperate meal thus concluded dishes wines and attendants vanished and their talk commenced such another is the story of a contest in feats of strength and skill between duke william and harold when the latter went to normandy to claim the restoration of his kinsmen who had been hostages in williams hands  one day as during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging the normans were diverting their leisure with martial games in which taillefer shone preeminent while harold and william stood without their tent watching the animated field the duke abruptly exclaimed to mallet de graville  bring me my bow now harold let me see if thou canst bend it the bow was brought and saxon and norman gathered round the spot i fasten thy glove to yonder tree mallet said the duke taking that mighty bow in his hand and carefully feeling the string then he drew the arc to his ear and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock as the shaft piercing the glove lodged half way in the trunk i such are not our weapons said the earl  and ill would it become me unpractised so to peril our english ho nour as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow but that i may show these norman knights that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer bring me forth godrith my shield and my danish axe taking the shield and axe which the saxon brought to him haiold then stationed himself before the tree  now fair duke said he smiling i choose thou thy longest shaftbid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows round this tree will i move and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body i leave unguarded by my shield i no said william hastily  that were murder i it is but the common peril of war said harold simply and he walked to the tree i the blood mounted to williams brow and the lions thirst of carnage parched his throat  an he will have it so said he beckoning to his archers  let not normandy be shamed watch well and let every shaft go home avoid only the head and the heart such orgulous vaunting is best cured by bloodletting the archers nodded and took their post each at a separate quarter and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the earl for as he moved though he kept his back guarded by the tree some parts of his form the shield left exposed and it would have been impossible in his quickshifting movements for the archers so to aim as to wound but to spare life yet the earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye calmly bright even at the distance all the shafts of the archers at one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each that three fell to the ground blunted against it and two broke on its surface but william waiting for the first discharge and seeing full mark at harolds shoulder as the buckler turned now sent forth his terrible shaft the noble taillefer with a poets true sympathy cried i saxon beware but the watchful saxon needed not the warning as it in disdain harold met not the shaft with his sild but swinging high the mighty axe which with most men required both arms to wield it he advanced a step and clove the rushing arrow in twain  before williams loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield on the whole we should say that harold is an utter failure sir edward lytton is not the man for the task he has not a breath of the spirit of the middle ages within his breast and thus writes at haphazard when he would expound the motives and feelings of the personages of his story he sees nothing of their characters and conduct but a few external peculiarities unlike any thing that ever came across his own limited experience and associated in his mind with ideas with which they hand no real connexion whatsoever he has also adopted a foolsb medley of styles of composition which destroys the readableness ot his book as much as its incorrectness destroys its historical utility the result is that harold is about as much a picture of anglosaxon and norman times as lord eglintouns gimcrack tournament was a revival of the genuine sports of antique days added to this sir edward has been so worried by the critics of the press for the immoral tendencies of his previously publishied novel lucretia that he has determined to make harold a terribly moral  book and bhas converted the connexion between the saxon king and edith into a pure sentimental affection anmd this by way of historical accuracy  rzctxor iihrold the last of thie saxon kin lrs b3y sir e if lo rron hart in 3 vols ljondon 184s bentley iiaving received from sir e buser lytton a very polite note stating that he had requested his publisher to send us a copy of his harold for review wc should have felt some surprise that it had not reached ius hut that the same thing has occtirrcd in some halfdozen other instances proving that it is not an accidental neglect but the result of that unaccountable and strangely implacable hostility which tiie critic has from the beginning until now encountered from two or three publishers who have no cause that we are aware of for their enmity as we are not consciotus of having dealt with other than the most perfect fairness with any book to which their names have been appended luring the five years tniz critic has been fulfilling the duties of a literary journal that their hostility unkind and uncalled for as it is has not in any way affected our conduct towards them every reader can bear testimony for still have the hooks they publish received the same impartial notice and filled the same prominent kakce in our columns as if they had extended to us the same courtesy as they show to our other literary journal and as other publishers show to this although compelled to borrow their looks from circulating libraries they have not been either neglected or unjustly treated in our columns nor even if the same hostility be continued unmitigated will any different rule govern our conduct for the future we notice the fact now only because the present instance is a remarkable one and to account to the author and to our readers for a brevity of notice compelled by the inconvenient circumstances under which this review is written harold differs materially from any other of sir e b lyttons fictions it is in its design an epic and in its composition a chronicle the author has successfully endeavoured to combine the unity of the one with the individuality of the other the period chosen is peculiarly adapted for an epic whether in prose or in poetry the catastrophe is a great historical event gradually evolved out of the incidents that occupy the narrative the interest rises with every chapter and at the close becomes intense but sir e b lytrton has in this romance attempted much more than merely an attractive story he has sought to embody history to present an accurate as well as a vivid and lifelike picture of the times to realise them as it were to his readers imagination and to his own hence harold is something more than a sofabook it is a work for the study and might worthily take its place upon the historical shelf in the library so careful has been the author to preserve the strictest accuracy in the appointments of his romance that he has adduced at the bottom of the page the authorities from which his information is taken so laborious a work may not please the mere novelreader so much as a flimsy creation of the fancy but it will be more valued by those whose approval is most valuable and will secure for it a more lasting existence as it is a book which wvill be read by every body we will not attempt to anticipate their enjoyment by any account of the plot suffice it to observe that britons saxons normans and northmen are introduced with their several distinctive characteristics giving immense variety to the picture and that harold is sketched with a mastery of minute traits of character gradually developed which the author has not sur passed if lie has equalled in any former fiction we present one specimen only the death of edward the confessor the king who had already undergone the last holy offices of the church was lying quite quiet his eyes half closed breathing low but regularly he had been spechless the two preceding days on this he had uttered a few words which showed returning consciousness his hand reclined on the coverlid was clasped in his wies wbo was praying fervently something in tonne touch of her hand or the sound of her murmur stirre the king from the growing lethargy and his as oaeni fixed on the kneeling lady ah  said he netly  ever good ever meek  think not i did ot love thee hearts will be read yonder we shall have our guer don the lady looked up through her streaming tears edward released his hand and laid it on her head as in benediction then motioning to the  abbot of westminster he drew from his finger the ring which the palmers had brought to him and murmured scarce audibly be this kept in the house of st peter in memory of me  he is alive now to usspeak whispered more than one thegn one abbot to alred and to stigand and stigand as the harder and more worldly man of the two moved up and bending over the pillow

shepherd to thy bereaven flock  whom shall we admonish to tread in those traces thy footsteps leave below  the king made a slight gesture of impatience and the queen forgetful of all but her womanly sorrow raised her eye and finger in reproof that the dying was thus disturbed but the stake was too weighty the suspense too keen for that reverent delicacy in those around and the thegns pressed on each other and a murmur rose which murmured the name of harold  bethink thee my son said aired in a tender voice tremulous with emotion  the young atheling is too much an infant yet for these anxious times edward signed his head in assent  then said the norman bishop of london who till that moment had stood in the rear almost forgotten amongst the crowd of saxon prelates but who himself had been all eyes and ears  then said bishop william advancing  if thine own royal line so fail who so near to thy love who so worthy to succeed as william thy cousin the count of the normans  dark was the

B4172,['6717360'],  a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series

B4931,['6793468'],  memoirs of the comtesse de boigne 1781181m interesting memoirs edited from the original manuscript by m charles nicoullaud heinemann 10s net these memoirs are exactly what memoirs should beto be of value and interest no attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull a great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a european reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be so she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  if i had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory i should have given up my project for i desired a distraction and not a laborious work hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  i regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work i have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair so writes the comtesse de boigne there is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote there is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production death plays too prominent a part when the comtesse de boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother after this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which i had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  i attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  the following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which i could hardly bear begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth and the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work she lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life in this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain there is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself the comtesse de boigne nee charlotte louise eleonore adelaide dosmond loved her name as well she might and she was childless from the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew osmond who became the marquis dosmond to be her heir he was ten years old in 1866 when she died he came into the possessions which she left him in august 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday with his intimate friend m charles nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world for twentyfive years they remained in the possession of m nicollaud to whom the marquis dosmond entrusted them during that time death was busy among the family and the marquis dosmond himself at length died  the family name is extinct the estate of osmond has been sold piecemeal the castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed but into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated what is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them she makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in london or the last days of the court at versailles or the bivouac of cossacks in the champs elysees at the restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of sir john legard with whom her family stayed in yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as chateaubriand or talleyrand or madame de stael or the emperor alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar the attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the tuileries where the ladies of the empire met the ladies of the old court after the return of monsieur there is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts the memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the revolution the empire and the restoration must be of supreme interest and value the translation is good and the notes which the editor m nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness the present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs the second volume bringing the narrative to the revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of louis philippe,biography

rather varruhlus pages for just one hint ofheresyv  the autobiography of a supertramp byw h davies with a preface by bernard shaw a c fifield 6s when a few years since a modest volume of poems entitled  the souls destroyer appeared the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken the book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of william h davies we learned just enough to whet our curiosity we learned for instance that the new poet was a onelegged man who lived in a common lodginghouse somewhere in southwark that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s a week and that most wonderful of all he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense this sounded promising  but like oliver twist we wanted more at length mr davies has taken pity on our ignorance he has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life and a marvellous record it is  in these days incident having deserted the region of fiction is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary certainly  the autobiography of a supertramp we like not the title by the way it is too slavishly shavian contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by say mr rolf boldrewood its author has tramped it up hill and down dale  he is equally at home on the highroads of america or in the slums of our english cities he has known the agonies of starvation and by dint of considerable practice has acquired the difficult art of begging his companions have been thieves vagrants and mendicants not since borrow it seems safe to say have we had a presentment so vivid forceful and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people and the strange thing about it all is that mr davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books he has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song and with an eye always on the end of wanderingthe happy haven that awaits the tired voyager it is difficultindeed it is almost impossibleto quote from this volume so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter but one incident in this odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded the scene is america mr davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad they were each fined five dollars by the judge hot with indignation davies refused to disgorge a cent the remainder must be told in his own words  judge stevens looked at us steadily for a time and then asked this astounding question boys how much are you prepared to pay brum who had very little sense of justice and being such a good beggar set very little value on money asked the judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us if i had been alone at this time i would have paid nothing but to save brush from going to prison who i knew would support me through all i satisfied myself that if the judge approved of this amount i would pay it without further comment the judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously and then cried with a magnanimity that was irresistible  pass over the dollars boys  you shall have a chance this time as a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression together with its entire freedom from cant make it in every sense of the term a truly remarkable production mr shaw contributes a characteristic preface  the autobiography of jack ketch with fourteen illus trations from designs by meadows edward churton london if the selfrecorded lives of public men are of importance to society as exemplification of difficulties surmounted on the high road to eminence then assuredly the subject of these memoirs has a claim up on the gratitude of a highspirited and intellectual people and in thus publishing his interesting experience it is certain he will not be the least in their esteem although with some of them it is just possible that he may be the last the appearance of this volume conveys more than is superficially apparent its sombre garb is typical of sorrowthe gaudy label on its back cannot cheat us into any other belief it is the funereal glitter of a gilt plate upon a coffinlid no the fact cannot be concealed jack catch is no longer what he wasno longer the bustling active functionaryhis place is not of the value of a ropesendhis occupations gone the schoolmaster has filched his rod and he is now on the list with titled sinecurists and public pensioners how in this most unprosperous period must his recollection carry him back to the good old tory times when a mighty slender qualification made a man eligible for tyburntree  when the maladroit conveyance of a twopound note made him intimate with a halter with what an artistlike eye on a monday morning must he have surveyed the beam whereon some three or four of these fortyshilling freeholders were cooling their heels outside the debtors door for an hour at a stretch those were days of business jack catch had no time to write books then  the utmost he could do was to favour his friends with a line but sessions are long that have no endings the functionarys friends are again in power and jack catch may hope for the results the book is however a more pleasant speculation than the times and here we find the career of the author faithfully narrated from his earliest infancy down to the period when he takes office by succeeding his uncle to the important post of representative of the sheriff of london our hero first saw the light in the  darksome secrecy of rose and crown court and with an independence truly original does not claim hereditary respectability but says  let me not mince the matter for mincing it will not make the matter lessmy father was a thief isle was however professedly a waiter but his napkin was not large enough to cloak his little peculiarities and he met his fate at the new drop kindly assisted by his respected relative his mother his  sainted mother shortly afterwards laid herself open to a suspicion of not  accurately distinguishing the right of property and was commanded to  expatriate herself for life here then commences the career of our hero virtually an orphan by the laws of his country the entire code of which he declared open war with in his subsequent career morc we are obliged to confess from his natural tastes than from pious revenge for the wrongs of his parents it would deprive the work of half its interest with the reader were we to proceed with it in the elaborate way we could wish we will therefore merely say that the introluction into life of the thief and the vagabond was through the appropriate medium of an attorlneys officgithere he was introduced to some few of the choicest blackguards in a small way about town  but upon the natural event of his master absconding with the money of his  only respectable clientjack was thrown upon his own resourses and went

that there is more interest in this little volume than in all the novels brought out this season in the first eight or nine chapters there is wit lurking in every line and we may truly say that every period has its point the continuation abounds with interesting situations forcible delineations of character anl startling eventsthe conclusion is perfectly in keeping with the whole those who look

his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us

it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies practice walking the more graceful they become in their movements those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one a graceful correctionthe proper study of mankind is womanpunch woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive a kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  a miss way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a kentucky lawyer in that city after which

him in her balloon brigham young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of utah are her women it is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources the last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers  the poet of the breakfast table saturday november 2 1872 literature by oliver wendell holmes routledge  sons we have had the autocrat and the professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour we cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded it would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the poet like the autocrat and professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly the breakfasttable series is now complete its fault is its extreme length the poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse if he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as pas trop de zele the poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue there are fourteen persons at the breakfast table the opposite ends are occupied by the landlady and the capitalist on one side are the poet the scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a man of letters a master of arts a young girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called scheherazade and the lady on the other side are dr b franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the astronomer the member of the haouse as the legislator calls himself the registrarof deeds the salesman and that boy the lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community he turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary in this company the poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures they are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries the poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match the following are among very numerous examples  it aint just the thing to grease your ex with the isle of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do again   it is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle cotton mather was miserable all his days i am afraid after that entry in his diary  this day dr sewele was chosen president for his piety1 we may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal americans believe that there are no hs in england and frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  however we could match the goodlooking landlady of the poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope the daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the order of things and who remarks  i hope to do some sound thinking in heavenif i ever get there  fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects the first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted they have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from heaven the groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem we approve of the old masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed i dont like your chopped music any way that woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesflorence nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowiez out isnt not that exactly but something like it i have been to hear some music pounding after describing the concert with much humour he adds i like to hear a woman sing and i like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me i know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and pop went a small piece of artillery    that boy was in his seat looking demure enough the master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which i saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our great organthat himalayan home of harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often there is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  i thank god that a great many people believe a great deal more than i do i think when it comes to serious matters i like those who believe more than i do better than those who believe less there is no doubt that this is a general feeling we endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   it is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it if he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone in quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the breakfast table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids the character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the young girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the weekly bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it the poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul she ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail i spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night the poet thinks the toiling scheherazade of the weekly bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers the sunworshippers daughter which she wrote for the bucket here is a sample  kiss mine eyelids beauteous morn blushing into life newborn  lend me violets for my hair and thy russet robe to wear and thy ring of rosiest hue set in drops of diamond dew  kiss my lips thou lord of light kips my lips a soft good night westward sinks thy golden car  leave me but the evening star and my solace that shall be borrowing all its light from thee  we may now rise from the breakfast table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that wellfurnished board,biography
B7698,['6848974'],  the later years of catherine de medici reviews catherine de medici by edith sichel archibald constable and co this is an eminently readable if not a very valuable book miss sichel frankly admits in her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact and has detected no error in accepted dates she has sought to paint the portrait of catherine de medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny she says  here in paris near the louvre beneath the window whence catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of st bartholomew     or near that other window which looked out upon the fastcrimsoning seine  it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past in fact miss sichels book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts but surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities that the window of the louvre overlooking the seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the st bartholomew massacre considerably postdates that tragic event for the sake of a picture however the most vivid details are sure to be selected and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt and this makes the kind of portraiture which miss sichel practises of small worth to the student and even misleading in certain cases but the method has a value of its own it supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history it gives him more than does the historical novel and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do to the appreciation of which qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable there is a danger however that the colouring of the picture may be overdone that the perspective may be false it is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice men historians often enough fall into the same fault under the influence of political and religious bias but with women it seems impossible to avoid it women are born into the world to love and love always entails hate miss sichel is not far from hating catherine de medici and the age of the renaissance in which she lived she writes  the ligue was the counterpart of catherine we have compared it to the great french revolution but there is this vital difference between the two the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea it was the beginning of an erathe death of catherine closed an epoch with her died the age of the renaissance and with the reign of henry iv there came the dawn of modern timesit was the destiny of catherine de medici to imbibe the poison of either influence that of the reformation and that of the renaissance from the reformation she derived its abusesits degradation of religion into politics its gross polemic materialism the more pernicious for priestly vestments from the renaissance she inhaled its stagnant paganism its cold curiosity its stupid blindness to aught but the senses its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in there are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men it is the death of the ideal of faith in man of faith in anything outside him these were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others history provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but sometimes unconsciously it reveals to us certain moral laws it is a medium for them not a pulpit if any person any age is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality that age is the reign of the last valoisthat person is catherine de medici most if not all of this is fustianlittle better indeed than sheer nonsense in the first place it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras epochs ages and modern times strictly speaking there is no such thing as an era an epoch an age or modern times with every minute that goes by the middle ages for instance are getting further and further away from the middle assumingwhich is of course not the case that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end to tell us that the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning and if miss sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the french revolution she is assuredly mistaken if anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudoclassical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movementa pseudoclassicism which by the way achieved among other things the complete destruction of the art of painting in franceat any rate for the presenta curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received especially as it is highly typical the gross polemic materialism of the reformation the more pernicious for priestly vestments is unfair to a highly complex movement one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison detre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism to accuse the renaissance of stupid blindness to aught but the senses is far too sweeping a charge and indeed a stupid one whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been the christian world owes to the renaissance an immense debt to say that catherine de medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man which he has never been without as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge is to give that good lady who had her commendable points an importance which she never possessed and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft  of the meed of immortality with miss edith sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency history she says provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page which is her last yet although for long men did not know it they were aremaking towards a common goal and using a common watchword that watchword that goal is freedom making f or  moving  is a slang expression but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist  of what use is the historian any way if he is not to be a conscious moralist with history or as much as he can find out about it as his text which is a theological text into the bargain  for the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of good over evil and in that conclusion we are entirely we think in accord with miss edith sichel,biography

prepossessing he hid but one eye and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two the eye he bad was unquestionably useful but decidedly not ornamental being of a greenish grey and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door the blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up which gave him a very sinister appearance especially when he smiled at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations his hair was very flat and shiny save at the ends where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner he was about two or three iind titty and a trifle below the middle size he wore a white neckerchief with long eadsandasiiit of scholastic black but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long and his trousers a great deal too short he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable  mr squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffeeroom fireplaces titted with one such table as is usually seen in iotfeerooms and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition in a corner of the

life and adventures of nicholas nickltby bv charles dickens chapman and hall great success is a thing as little understood in literature nowadiys as great failure the tut issi mus ibis is found in the old place the sale of the pickwick papers was very generally held to be in the nature of a bookselling curiosity and when a j career as prosperous was foretold for a new work of the same extent by the same hand wise people j shook their heads and said it was impossible it has been proved possible notwithstanding the sale of nicholas nickleby is understood even thus early to have exceeded by many thousands that of l pickwick papers without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent it establishes though claim of thc work to critical consideration on the highest grounds and with reference to the best models we propose in this spirit briefly to examine its pretensions to rank with thc enduring fictions of our language since richardson published in successive portions his famous story of clarissa har lo we ami enthusiastic damsels eager for the conversion of lovelace besieged and implored the author as for a living sinner whose future state depended on thc decision to  save his soul alive no characters of an unfinished1 work of fiction have excited anything like the interest manifested by large classes of persons in all ranks for the fate of the various actors in the tale of nicholas nicklcby the cibbers of that day after  a delicious meal of miss byron  in one volume were not more anxious for  another slice of herein the next than the cibbers of our own after regaling themselves with a squeers or a smike or a newman noggs or a vincent crummies in number six have been for other slices of them in number seven this shows us at the outset a great secret of the popularity of the author he seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality isle thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand our sympathies are never left to wander off into quarters vague or undefined from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them and this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or i w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so in everything of that kind that he presents to us there is in his manner of doing it the manliness and simplicity of nature or the truth of life as it is we are never repelled by the abominations of egotism conceit or dogmatism we are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule if there is good going on there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty  and if there is evil it runs no chance of being mistaken for good the quantity of invention observation and knowledge of character observable in tl writings of mr dickens is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion now by all the various readers of this tale of nicholas nichlebyand they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each otherthese various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt in this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces  them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them this is a test which only a man of genius could bear it is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low in regard to the customs and usages of life are so revealed for it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity than by the alliances of common habits that we are all linked together the highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other peoples opinions these are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in incidentally they embrace many others his style is for the most part admirable bating some faults of occasional exaggeration which we may presently advert to it is fresh and racy and has the surpassing charms of simplicity earnestness animal spirit and good humour a rare virtue in it is that it is always whether grave or gay thoroughly intelligible and for the most part thoroughly natural its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos it is a quick as warm as comprehensive as the sympathies it is taxed to express we know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet or iltostfate mot happily by n sehofeesjassion whatever mr dickes knows or l9mmmlm ma tm wttm  mtmmmmmma mmmsm  tfmmw  vcevs ivofe is ju we jp sfavsparsmsi  i no beating about the bush for it it is not carefully deposited

old facts with a new life it breathes into old thoughts a new emotion who that hus read his descriptions ofthe various localities of loudon as set down in this story of nicholas nickuby can ever expect to forget them more a fresh glow of warmth and light plays over thc cheerful and familia places a deeper mist of misery and blackness settles on thc darker scenes with him we pass along misty streets in some cold and ogy morning while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour yet were it oay for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears distantly and indistinctly as though the o had muflicd them we could not doubt that it was london we enter with him by night through long double rows of brightly burning lamps a noisy bust lim crowded scene in which he shows us the rags of the squalid balladsinger fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmiths glittering treasures and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men add this is the same london as before at all times and under every aspect bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms we come to know better the very places we have known best wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in golden square thc saracens head on snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality the alphonse of cadogan place reveal themselves plain bills to our practised eye  and the sight of even a real butterfly fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless city square startles us no more and with all these masterly requisites for his art is mr dickens a perfect novelist by no means he has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story without which that rank can never be attained he has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration to which though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the pickwick papers he is still too prone in saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him it is a due compliment to such a writer to assume that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together the great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot we need hardly observe is fielding for exquisitest contrivance for happiest extrication of story he stands quite unrivalled in this respect tom jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last which docs not more or less tell upon the story while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc gents by which its results ure to be worked out thus black george is scarcely a less essential personage than tom jones himself and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine each in his own peculiar sphere to one grand effect its only episode the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on is that of thc old man of thc hill introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of cervantes and le sage passing this there is not an eddy a current scarcely a single ripple on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art nicholas nie kleby could not stand such a test for an instant a want of plan is apparent in it from the first an absence of design the plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers instead of having been mapped out beforehand the attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recall us to the main interest and action admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect art the consequence of it is in this case that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on though writer and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters needful indeed to a gathering up of the loone or broken threads of an imperfect story but sounding more like the minute recitals of a lawyers deed than the natural development of a book of so much originality

this kind we are not certain even that the more amiable characters of the book are always so amiable as we are desired to suppose them and we must confess an insuperable aversion to the heroics of nicholas nickleby himself when as it happens sometimes they obscure even his strong and gentle mind we take him to cut a poor figure for example in that quarrel with our dear mr lenville how ultraexquisite saving only that are all the scenes with the strollers 1 and when he stalks out nf the green room  bowing slightly to the assembled company we long to have been there notwithstanding our seldomvarying strong affection for him to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit we can scarcely reproach ourselves for this we are not sure that even mr dickens himself is indisposed to quiz now and then these little foibles of his favourite hero it is we remember after a certain sort of hasty demonstration of them that one of the helpers at thc saracens head is heard to exclaim  hallo this is somebody in disguise this is and another follows up the joke with  room for the eldest son of the emperor of roosher iienlimn but when we follow the son of the imperial potentate into bis little dark and deserted room when we see him in his tender devotion to poor smike an always touching and most beautiful feature in the story w rought too with consummate art when we are with him in his lonely thoughts of sister and home all other vagaries are forgotten and nothing is visuie to the moistening eye save the simplicity and sweetness of his nature we have only to make one exception more we referred to it when we spoke of some exaggerations in mere style mr dickens occasionally overlays his thoughts with needless epithets and is over profuse in his use of adjectives it is only in his reflections we find thisand that rarelyin his descriptions never and now having hastily glanced at objectionable points in the conduct or treatment of this famous story what a host of beauties crowd on our grateful recollection for which we have not opportunity or space to give even a passing glance to with what pleasant thoughts it has stocked our memory with what true and tender sentiments enriched our hearts with what a healthy and manly moral instructed our minds with bow much vivid distinctness each character takes its place before us how plainly we pee the individualities of each the form of their faces the accident of their habits the nicer peculiarity of their minds these are triumphs which on i j belortg to a firstrate writer the creative powers of the novelist when properly directed and well sustained take rank with history itself the mchylus of parson adams is not less real than the spectacles of burke the trumpet of sir joshua or the snuffbox of gibbon in reserve for mr dickens are still greater triumphs if he has patience and perseverance to prepare hiimelf by study and selfrestraint hy the pursuit of art and the pruning of commonplace exuberance for their full and satisfactory achievement we hope that he will not fail in this great is the glory though the strife be bard and heartily do we wish him strength to surmount the one and long life to enjoy the other we see in him at no distant day if he does entire justice to hi powers the not unworthy successor of our goldsmiths and fieldings,biography

failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him and his books are bought and read by everybody that this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of its readers with new groups of people as familiar and real as any that in life they may have known  that it overflows with inimitable grace and tenderness that it is stored with the most subtle wit and with a humour hearty and true that sets always instinctively at work our pleasantest and kindliest emotions  that mirth and pathos abound in it that its satire is always just and manly and that it is full of generous indignation against social usages that create wrong and perpetuate suffering among usis simply in other words to say that it is a book written by mr dickens that it has also faults is to say that it is not quite a miracle even though written by bim mtmwytttehm truly may be found with it and such aa prope ap company great qualities in the whole line of uumtji throughout the history of literature there will be discovered few writers indeed who have produced unexceptioothe books books become everlasting by the fetuoe tiwi it ia them and by

same spirit fielding wrote treating his tom jones as an epic upon this high ground we must stand if we would properly discuss lileah house it touches and amuses us but it is destined to draw teare and smiles also from our childrens children mr dickens has a large public in the present and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future the world will grow wiser than it is the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappearbut the spirit in which he writes and to which he appeals is indestructible  and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah house has relation to its plot the conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole und to interfere with though steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue but let us in the present instance with no less justice remark that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole the studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah house is very manifest event leads to event and chance words or though deeds of chance people that seem perfectly irrelevant are seen everywhere precisely as in real life exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death of happiness or misery to men and women perfectly unknown to them taking the mere surface view of such treat ment it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connexion and design and to display in the j attempt only our own very real want of sagacity this subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents is in fact truer to nature infinitely truer than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world its drawback is that it compels the uso tf a huge number of characters which come and go during though progress of the story  und j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journeys end over the  ground he has traversed they may now and then cause some j confusion in the readers mind mid produce an etlect like j that of an overcrowded picture 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault  he this as it may never in any former work has mr j dickens made use of a plot so evidently planned before hand with minute consideration or throughout so elaborately studied even the lits of the little lawstationers servant aid directly in the chain of little things that lead indirectly to though catastrophe of lady dedlocks death so dexterously indeed an the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah house that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them as a mere cloud of isolated incidents a novel j may havo its too superficial readers as life has its too hasty obsorvers at though closo of his preface mr dickens marks incidcii tally the general character of the tale by the intimation thatj in it ho has purposely dwelled upon the romantic side of i familiar things marvellous is the skill with which towards j this intention though great chancery suit on which the plot hinges and on incidents connected with which important or trivial all though passion and suffering turns is worked into j every part of the book whenever though occasion arises or j the art of the storyteller requires though thick atmosphere of j law that rises out of jumdyee t darndyce is made to cling  like a fog about thc peoplo in though story it may be more or less but there it is either as a thick cloud or a light mist it is to be seen everywhere lawyers of many grades law clerks of all kinds the copyist the lawstationer thu usurer suitors of every description haunters of though law courts and their victims live and move round ubout though life of the chief persons iu the tale and exercise almost insensibly but very certainly a continual influence upon them comparo this with what a commonplace writer would have preferred and a congenial critic recommended and you will understand what though power of a man of genius really is to have made the plot itself a connected story of a chancery suit would havo beeu except for though merest commonplace ono of though clumsiest and most impracticable designs conceivable mr dickens knew hotter what he was alout and though use made of jarndyco v jamdyco in lileah house is always complete and masterly fjthe other grand feature of the tale connected also closely yet quito naturally with this is the dedlock household lt is brought out with equal power with the same thoughtful elaboration aud with as perfect a result not only have we sir leicester a truo gentleman with all his weaknesses and lady dedlock the supercilious woman of fashion with a busy heart painfully throbbing beneath that hard and quiet outside but yolumnia and though cousins the town house and the footmen thc country house and ita good oldfashioned housekeeper all aro worked out with the finish of a master from the first glimpse of the assembled dedlock household discussing the doodles and foodies and cuffys and buffya in which they believe politics to consist down to the last chapters that concern themchapters in eluding the flight and pursuit of the unhappy lady dedlock which are in conception aud construction absolutely wonderfulthe power aud care spent upon though group are unceasingly exerted yet so successfully as to bear no trace of effort to keep it throughout iu that central position towards which the other sections of though tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge taking the story piecemeal as a mero gallery of pictures and persons we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah house finer than anything that even mr dickens has yet produced in the same way exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former writings wo can remember none by which we have been touched so deeply or that has been graced by so much of the very finest writing as though entire tale of the streetwandering joe as it may be gathered from the pages of the book before us in though trooper george though ragnets and their humble household we have another of those fine broad hearty exemplifications of humour in which mr dickens delights in which all though ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all nothing is repulsive  everything is large laughable and true and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness the character of esiher summerson has been much elaborated and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything mr dickens has ever writtenindeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it full as it is of noble fancies and delicate and graceful thoughts but wo suspect that mr dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities we cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone which if not selfconsciousness is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of though character depicted yet the graces and virtues of esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them  and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues mrs jelly by and her despondent husband her daughter caddy and though turveydrops the trooper george and his man phil the brickmakers wives and the dead infant the lawstationer and his little woman roy thorn and ski dipole mr chadband and the coavinses the mother of mr  uppy the inscrutable and impassable tulkinghorn to say nothing of 1 poor miss flite or the immortal bucket and a dozen others j have been added here to the long list of ideal people with j whom mr dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted mr dickenss characters as all the world knows pass their names into our language and become types lt is  an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature to personify some main idea which are ever after found universally applicable such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since though beginning of all literature they know little how much there is in any ono mans head or heart who expect to have every i character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological  dissecting table and demonstrated minutely we see nobody minutely in real life the rough estimates we form of character aro on though whole if we possess any tact correct  but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes and it is the prominences the sharp i angles that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling hence it is therefore as well as for i other reasons that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters though rest ofthe sketch is filled iup by the reader or spectator instinctively and sufficiently i out of his own experience squire allworihy rlifil philosopher square parson adams trulliber and all the rest of fieldings characters were formed upon this plan  nor was it thought unjust or unnatural by the great novelist to give distinctness to thc picturo in each case by just so much of genial strength and breadth of colouring as should prevent his idea from being impressed too faintly on the public mind it is for the most part much more easy than correct to cry outexaggeration wo may be only betray ing our ignorance after all thero is an eastern saying to the effect that there is in the world precisely what the eye can find in it and let us not suppose that what limits our viewin any particular direction should of necessity be an equal restriction to thc view of a man of genius of mr dickens it is to bo said if of any oue that his main strength has lain in the ability to concentrate his thoughts on objects external to himself if his mero personality were at every turn set up as the limit aud bound to his perceptions if it were still his recurring habit to tako his own character as the infallible test of all other characters ho would in each fresh essay be always retracing only the old weary ground rut ready and cager at all times with genial warmth and fulness to enter in all the peculiarities of others we have him continually throughout his books apprehending and interpreting iew forms of character and truth and carrying with each new achievement of his genius new pleasure nnd delight into thousands of homesbecause his genius is his fellowfeel in with his race to illustrate these remarks a few passages may bo taken almost at random from the tragical

B9098,['6793468'],  memoirs of the comtesse de boigne 1781181m interesting memoirs edited from the original manuscript by m charles nicoullaud heinemann 10s net these memoirs are exactly what memoirs should beto be of value and interest no attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull a great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a european reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be so she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  if i had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory i should have given up my project for i desired a distraction and not a laborious work hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  i regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work i have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair so writes the comtesse de boigne there is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote there is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production death plays too prominent a part when the comtesse de boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother after this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which i had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  i attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  the following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which i could hardly bear begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth and the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work she lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life in this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain there is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself the comtesse de boigne nee charlotte louise eleonore adelaide dosmond loved her name as well she might and she was childless from the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew osmond who became the marquis dosmond to be her heir he was ten years old in 1866 when she died he came into the possessions which she left him in august 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday with his intimate friend m charles nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world for twentyfive years they remained in the possession of m nicollaud to whom the marquis dosmond entrusted them during that time death was busy among the family and the marquis dosmond himself at length died  the family name is extinct the estate of osmond has been sold piecemeal the castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed but into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated what is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them she makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in london or the last days of the court at versailles or the bivouac of cossacks in the champs elysees at the restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of sir john legard with whom her family stayed in yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as chateaubriand or talleyrand or madame de stael or the emperor alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar the attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the tuileries where the ladies of the empire met the ladies of the old court after the return of monsieur there is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts the memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the revolution the empire and the restoration must be of supreme interest and value the translation is good and the notes which the editor m nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness the present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs the second volume bringing the narrative to the revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of louis philippe,biography

B4957,"['8942801', '2436302', '6831927']",  the white peacock by d h lawrence heinemann this novel is a characteristic specimen of the modern fiction which is being written by the feminine hand the older ideas and ideals are sacrificed ruthlessly to an attempt to breathe vitality into a succession of cinematographic pictures illustrative of the lives of the dramatis personal there is however no selection as this method would suggest impressions are merely scattered at random it is as it were paulopostimpressionism in fiction that there is cleverness in thismodern study of nerves is obvious from the first chapter but it is equally impossible to avoid the conclusion that the characters were spun in the authors brain there is no verisimilitude farmers daughters talk high culture and an ordinary readers head whirls in trying to determine the social relations of the sundry people involved scenes seem introduced merely because the author has observed them or thought of them not because they add anything to the plot or even to the atmosphere such is the modern method which a growing school of writers in this country encourages but which as we have pointed out before owes its conception rather to zola than to english sources the author of the white peacock is never realistic with the crudity of the master but she is needlessly frank to a fastidious mind as the trend of the novel in general seems to be in this direction she should be successful particularly when she has learned her craft better there are suggestions and even more than suggestions of the making of a fine style in her writing  the white peacock by d h lawrence heinemann injd h lawrence we have a new writer one most certainly to be reckoned with it is his first book we understand and he is quite young quite unknown the white peacock should be read the book stands out among the ruck of contemporary fiction unmistakably as a work of artistic and literary excellence as the writing of a man who knows he will achieve both fame and distinction it is not perhaps a very good novel mr lawrence is somewhat prolix in his conversations his lifes orbit would seem a little limited there are loquacious oases of rather heavy and almost suburban dulness but there are flashes of real genius touches of physical interpretation a skill of observation a zeal of life a glow of intellect and above all a wonderful sensitiveness of art and nature which mark the writer as a real force he still needs craft the unerring craft of a wells he needs experience there is nothing much in the story which is the study of a little country circle without much incident or movement yet the book has a great fascination the scent of the countryside is all about it these people of his are realthere are some extraordinarily good descriptive scenesand the end is real no mawkish sentimentality no boyandgirl book this a true piece of writing revealing in places the sense of beauty and passion of a quite remarkable talent  fiction the white peacock by d h lawrence heinemanil 6s i hithidro we have only known mr d h lawrence as being one of the many interesting poets discovered by the english review henceforth we shall certainly know him as the author of the white peacock for it is beyond all argument an admirable and astonishing piece of work we use the word  astonishing  advisedly for like most new books of uncommon merit  the white peacock  surprises even while it charms there are pages in it that made the present reviewer a sophisticated and disillusioned reader of novels lay down the book and rub his eyes in wonder at the authors individuality and courage it is no very new story that he has to tell that a young woman should encourage two young men at once and should end by marrying the wrong one is possibly even more frequent in fiction than in life again that the slighted lover should thereon marry beneath him and take to drink is only ill accordance with the best traditions of the ingenuous school of novelists but in the hands of mr lawrence this old theme is quickened with new life the action takes place in the rural districts of nottinghamshire and it would hardly be fanciful to say that nature is the protagonist of the drama and that the author has drawn her character with uncommon care we realise her in all her moods and she is as interesting as she is convincing nor has the author taken less pains with the drawing of those special manifestations of nature that are called men and women the heroine is a delightful picture of a lively clever girl who likes excitement of all kinds and especially the rather dangerous excitement of leading passionate men on to making passionate love mr lawrences unravelling of this heedlessness is almost uncanny in its shrewdness but his greatest success is the character of george the farmerlover whose defeat and degradation supply the book with its motive this is a really masterly study of passion now wordless and pitiful now strung to its utmost intensity of selfexpression when the man realises his weakness and his own words hurt him like blows lettie loves his physical strength and the completeness of his submission and wisely enough according to her lights marries the other man because his money and social position make him a more suitable match it is clever of mr lawrence to compel us to sympathise both with george and lettie we are made to feel that they are both hard driven by their natures and are not to be blamed for the inevitable catastrophe but in truth of all the many characters in the book there is not one who does not move within the bounds of our sympathy the men are men the women women and the children who appear all too rarely are such children that we hope the author will be more generous of them in his next work apart from the characterisation the book would stand by its vivid pictures of a country life that is new to us where side by side with the primitive roughness that lingers wherever men and women till the soil the new ideas have taken root and are apparently about to flourish the author treats of the primitive with praiseworthy frankness and there is no denying the interest of the spectacle of a young farmer looking at aubrey beardsleys illustrations for the first time it is apparent to us that mr d h lawrence is one of those rare writers who intends only to tell the truth as he sees it and nothing but the truth as a consequence he has given us a book of considerable achievement and infinite promise,biography

a misfortune attending the criticism of this new and in many respects able work of sir e bulwer ly ton that those who write on itand indeed those who read itcan scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction if as history it is written with too much of the air of mere invention if as fiction it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler this is an evil attending the choice of the subjectand one which though many have made the attempt only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome to this rare and almost wonderful exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer but we must add that even in that case the experiment however generally successful occasioned many important distortions and perversions of factsand we will venture to say that it has produced especially in the present generation much doubt confusion and error as to characters opinions and events these observations are in a manner challenged by sir e b lyttons dedicatory preface and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes they appear to set up a claim for his fiction notwithstanding his denial of the pretension to the dignity and importance of history we hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily either let us have a production of mere fancy or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards the author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidentshe makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between harold and edith we admit at once that for his purpose he had 1 reason for making the changebecause itrenders the story not merely more interesting but on every account more readable on this point sir e b lytton observes  the love tory of harold nnd edith is told differently from the wellknown legend which implies a leis pure connexion but the whole legend respecting the edeva faira edith the fair whose name meets us in the doomsday roll rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal but which on many accounts i hope may be entrusted fearlessly to the young that is to wy he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawingroom tables and the boudoirs of he ordinary readers of such productions we should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities from hich he clearly means it to be inferred that n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done sobut we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive his archaegy spoils his book as a fictionjust as his departures from the same injure it as history he has thus put a curb on his imagination both regardspersons and eventsand would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints as it is the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader we may be surprised that he can do so well thus loaded but feel sure that he could have done much better unencumbered in fact the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination the description for instance of all that relates to the war of harold against gryffyth in wales is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen we will select our first specimen from this part of vol ii premising that gryffyth his queen and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness and that harold by a monk and a young norman has sent them a message of mercy on submission  as the monk ceased the thrill of the audience was perceptible and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur as if to constrain the king then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man the red spot flushed the dark cheek and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow he made one stride towards thc monk and said in a voice loud and deep and slow rolling far up the hillmonk thou hast said and now hear the reply ofthe son of llewellyn the true heir of roderic the great who from the heights of eryri saw all the lands

murderer of thy men in strife unavailing and vain  heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed be dumb hush thy screech lying raven exclaimed gryffyth his eyes darting tire and his slight form dilating  once priest and monk went before us to inspire not to daunt and our cry alleluia  was taught us by the saints ofthe church on the day when saxons fierce and many as harolds fell on the field of maesgarmon no the curse is on the head of the invader not on those who defend hearth and altar yea as the song to the bard the cursk leaps through my veins and rushes

to the last the ploughshare may pass over our cities but the soil shall be trod by our steps and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards nor in the great judgement day shall any race but the race of cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth to answer for the sins of the brave so impressive the voice so grand the brow and sublime the wild gesture of the king as he thus spoke that not only the monk himself was awed  not only though he understood not the words did the norman knight bow his head as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloudbut even the sullen and widespreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment but the spearmen and multitude above excited by the tidings of safety to life and worn out by repeated defeat and the dread fear of famine too remote to hear the king were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators creeping from rank to rank and already they begun to sway and move and sweep slowly down towards the king recovering his surprise the norman again neared gryffyth and began to reurge his mission of peace but the chief waived him back sternly and said aloud though in saxon no secrets can pass between harold and me thus much alone take thou back as answeri thank the earl for myself my queen and my people noble have been his courtesies as foe as foe i thank himas king defy the torque he hath returned to my hand he shall see again ere the sun set messengers ye aro answered withdraw and speed fast that we may pass not your steps on the road the monk sighed and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there that the king was alone in his fierce defiance then lifting again the rood he turned away and with him went the norman the above and nearly all that belongs to it is inventionand very admirably invented it is we know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the catking as gryftyth is called by the norman his struggles his defeats and his suffering we venture to think that sir e b lytton w much mistaken when he represents not merely the clergy but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the confessor as well acquainted with the literature of greece and rome it is true that as regards abbots and monks he is in compensation very severe he does justice to such ecclesiastics as lanfranc and aclred but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of latinwhile a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior the following is a short part of their dialogue  the kings norman favourites at least honoured the church that is true said an abbot 4 and an it were not for two things i should love the norman better than the saxon what are they my father asked an aspiring young monk inprints quoth the abbot proud of the one latin word he thought he knew but that as we see was an error they cannot speak so as to be understood and i fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning here was a sanctified groancount william himself spoke to me in latin  continued the abbot raising his eyebrows did he wonderful  exclaimed several voices and what did you answer holy fathermarrysaid the abbot solemnly i replied inprinisgood said the young monk with a look of profound admiration we have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes even of gryftyth the catking of wales we are told that his mind had turned from the literature of rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land nnd other personages both saxon and norman refer to greek and latin authors with fur too much familiarity homeric fables and homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our anglosaxon forefathers than has by many been supposed yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from horace into the mouth of a young soldierstill more that he should employ such in conversation with a rude saxon from the weald of kent of course what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection  and whether it did or did not require to be translated in ad 1052 it is quite clear that sir e b lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in ad 1848for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into english whatever might be the case in england in the eleventh century wo are sure that greek was not studied in italy even in thc thirteenth centuryand that dante knew nothing of homer unless at secondhand in connexion with this matter we may here not unfitly notice the great number of saxon and anglosaxon words employed by sir e b lytton without explanation even where explanation seemed most necessary if the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of  harold to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors so much thc better  but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation in brackets or otherwise  provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant but generally we think he will be quite at a loss for the meaning we copy a fewand but a fewregarding which we are confident even welleducated persons will be at some loss weregeld lithtmen ceorl suhcendinen cyst mane uses dour cnehts quern  which with many more are of perpetual occurrence we say nothing of such words as thegn which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thaneor of zemmes which sir e b lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gemsbut we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment the author seems to have crammed himself from mr deyncourts folios as he admits in his prefatory epistleand then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others this is an ordinary error the great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out for this reason we tell him that northeast is not to suppose because he sees in a plan of london of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears and because the sport may be mentioned by fitzstephen that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century his mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting but not a very accurate description of london before the conquest in his first volume the truth is that we have no sufficient materials for such a description and on this account we are willing to take sir e b lyttons fanciful representation which is highly picturesque he is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources one instance to the contrary may however be pointed out near the end of his second volume where william then count or dukeof normandy challenges harold to bend his bowan exertion to which the saxon noble is not accustomed and which therefore he declines the meaning of bending a bow is not as sir e b lytton seems to imagine the pulling of a clothyard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung it is stringing a bow an operation requiring both art and strength and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful of the story itself we have said little because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in historyif history it deserve at that early date to be called the loves of harold and edith form but a small portion of the tale and as that is the most imaginative portion so iu several respects it is the best the character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn  and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by and contrasted with the more masculine proportions and appearance of hilda her magical and mysterious grandmotherwho from first to last acts a very prominent part in all that relates to harolds affection and to his ambition she is a very grand personage who adheres to the saxon faith rejecting the christian creed and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious it must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of norna in sir w scotts  pirate and of meg merrilies in his  guy mannering but it is only for a momentand in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author what follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and hilda are introduced in the second volume   there is no joy for me returned edith plaintively and i have that on my heart she added with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone  which at last i will dare to speak i reproach thee hilda that thou hast marred all my life that thou hast duped me with dreams and let me alone in despair speak on said hilda calmly as a nurse to a froward child hast thou not told me from the first dawn of my wondering reason that mv life and lot were interwoven withwith the word mad and daring must out with those of harold the peerless  but for that which my fancy took from thy lips as a law i had never been so vain and so frantic i had never watched each play of his face and treasured each word from his lips i had never made my life but a part of his lifeall my soul but the shadow of his sun but for that i had hailed the calm of the cloisterbut for that i had glided in peace to my grave and nownow o hilda edith paused and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command and she resumed quickly thou knowest that these hopes were but dreamsthat the law ever stood between him and meand that it was guilt to love him i knew the law answered hilda but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird ye are sibbe to each other some five times removed and therefore an old man at rome saith that ye ought not to wed when the shavelings obey the old man at rome and put aside their own wives and frillas and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl i will stoop to hear of their lawswith disrelish it may be but without scorn it is no sin to love harold and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together form and heart hilda hilda madden me not with joy cried edith starting up in rapturous emotion her young face dyed with blushes and all her renovated beauty so celestial that hilda herself was almost awed as if by the vision of freya the northern venus charmed by a spell from the halls of asgard  but that day is distant renewed the vaia what mattera what matters cried the pure child of nature i ask but hope enoughoh enough if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave  lo then said hilda behold the sunfthts dawns again as she spoke the vaia stretchy her arm and through the intersticed columns of th fane edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward presently into the space of the eire came harold her beloved his face was pale jjiv grief yet recent but perhaps more than everdiiajv was in his step and command on his brow for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of saxon england and what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soulthon comest said hilda in the hour i predicted atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star vak1 said harold gloomily  i will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements  or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture the earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of earl godwin and his four sons from banishment and the declaration by harold of his love for edithwho as we have seen stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him the incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volumeand the interest is powerfully wound up in the third they therefore who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied let them wait until they have finished the whole and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work it is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact such in a degree is the case with harold in various parts of that story he is not so much its hero as william duke of normandy the victor at hastings and sir e b lytton has drawn the character of william with such force and fullness that when ht and harold are together it is not to be disputed that william attracts more attention if not interest than his younger rival we do not say that the affections of the reader are not with harold but the genius the resources the mental power and subtlety of william engross our admirationand would make us feel certain even if we knew nothing historically of the issue that he must triumph we admit all along the courage and generosity of harold but as the author tells us his parts are comparatively slowand when in normandy he was outwitted and would have been more so hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew haco this may be true as history bot it is not right as artand here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel we cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped and who we know in the end will be conquered  iarold the last of the saxon kings in three volumes london bentley 1848 it is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work nor is it necessary so to do sir bulwver lytton is not a new aspirant after literary honours but as we had long since been given to understand that he had made his last appearance before the literary world the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited the present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit cast long back in our history the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the norman invasion and accordingly having done so he has rendered the subject completely his own and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history the auce was one fraught with interest as being the last hours of the old saxon mnonarchy the legend of harold and edith is related but differently to the received opinion concerning it and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public into whose hands such a work may naturally be expected to faul superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought about but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the narratives of these timesthey were believed in thought to have a part in every action of life so that unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our saxon forefathers no terror is sought to be inepired by these ghostly aids they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency the author has succeeded in portraying a very beautiful character in edith she is firm noble and affectionate loving wvith an unselfish love that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested not by basking in the enjoyment it affords butt where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine her love for harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake even though it brought her all she coveted on earththe desire to be near him harold is a very fine creation admirably sustained throughout we may on the whole pronounce harald to be one of the most striking of sir bulwer lyltons ever striking novels there is something highly classical in the style which tells at once of the bent of the atithors mind and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomed  harold the last ofthe saxon kinqa vy sir e bulwer lytton london bentley 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle sir edward flulwer lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement he also threatens us with a series of similar stories in which the earlier history of england is to be done into romance4 furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old english morals men and manners and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellowcountrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by professed historians and chroniclers a man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of pelhamn we can scarcely conceive that one who looks upon pelham as a gentleman upon the last days of pomopeii as a elaaical story and upon lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue should also look upon himself as brmed to somprobend the motie of th dark and the mediaeval ages is perhaps not a thing to create much surprise but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever if indeed the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of harold as we have found it ourselves we have small fear for the result if they smile with us at the authors pedantry at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader at the benevolence with which he translates a latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned at the hodgepodge of old phraseology and the style of the chroniclers intermingled with the true bulwerian sentiment and language at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of norman french saxon technicalities and names of common objects and cant ejaculations if they yawn with us over the authors tedious historical disquisitions over the ossianic raptures of hilda and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations and the literary references which thickly strew his pages if besides all this they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which with whatever personal weaknesses was the animating spirit of the confessorking we have little expectation that the world will petition sir edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history or to turn the events of our annals into a salmngundi of truth ard falsehood from all this our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of harold the last of the saxon kings a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of july in truth we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance but with little pleasure and no interest here and there indeed the story becomes more lively and brilliant and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author especially towards the terniination when sir edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist and writes like a man of common sense his tale becomes more readable and lifelike until all at once with the beginning of some new chapter the style of the modern novelist is laid aside and a foolish bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention we need scarcely say that sir e b lyttons ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect he writes as much nonsense about plriests and monks and relics and churchservices as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about jesuits and convents his portraits of such mien as king edward and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic the scene of the monarchs deathbed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity we ever were fated to read it will please and edify our readers to see sir edwards ideas as to how a christian king dies  the king lay for some moments silent but evidently striving to recollect his thoughts meanwhile the two arch prelates bent over him stigand eagerly alred fondly then raising himself on one arm while with the other he pointed to harold at the foot of the bed the king said  your hearts i see are with harold the earl so be it je loctroi at these words he fell back on his pillow a loud shriek burst from his wifes lips all crowded around he lay as the dead at the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall he made his way abruptly to the bedside and said chidingly  air give him air the throng parted the leech moistened the kings pale lips with the cordial but no breath seemed to come forth no pulse seemed to beat and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood the rest descended the dais and hatened to depart harold only remained but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed  the crowd had gained the centre of the hall when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstepthe sound of the kings voice loud terribly distinct and full as with the vigour of youth restored all turned their eyes appalled all stood spellbound there mate the king upright on the bed his face men above the kneeling prelates and his eyes bright and shining down the hail  yyu he odd dellberatelyi ea ts shall be a nl vision or a sale malon pant me almigbty one the power of speech to tell it he aused a

standing mute and with the paleness of dead men by the side of my bed  these words were said so calmly and as it were so rationally that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone a shudder passed through the assembly and each man shrunk from the kings eye which seemed to each man to dwell on himself suddenly that eye altered in it cold beam suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent t the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect the whole face to work with horror the arms stretched forth the form writhed on the couch distorted fragments from the older testament rushed

steel and the flame lie boweth the mountains and comes down and darkness is under his feet v as if revived but for these tremendous denunciations as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed the eyes set and the king fell a corpse in the arms of harold in an earlier stage of the tale a similarly exquisite picture of the pious monarchs proceedings is given with all our authors felicity and truthtelling correctness veneration for the relics of saints is of course a fertile theme for ridicule throughout the story ania the poor king is painted as ready to sacrifice the lives and i appiness of living thousands for the sake of the bones of the deceased the efforts of the writer to show up the confessor as a drivelling child of superstition are indeed sufficient proof of his inadequacy to the task he has undertaken the following conversation between edward and harold is but one of a whole clas of passages  when the son of leofric had left the chamber the king rose wearily and said in

ancta mariathe thumb of st jude in nil jlustice however we must give a quotation or two displuaying the mrore trutiltul and agreeable qualities of tle better parts of the story such an one is the scene whihi followvs describing a saxon dinner of olden das  a monk of the order of st benedict then most in favour ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the abbot who after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek  ah guillaune he exclaimed in the norman tongue  this is indeed a grace for which to sing jubilate thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land ot illcooking and exile  talking of grace my dear father and food said de graville loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a waspfor even at that early 1eriod small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the french continent talking of grace the sooner thou savst it over some friendly refection the more will the latin sound unctuous and musical i have journeyed since daybreak and am now hungered and faint  alack alack cried the abbot plaintively  thou knowest little my son what hardships we endure in these parts how larded our larders and how nefarious our fare the flesh of swine salted  the flesh of beelzebub cried mallet de gravilte aghast  but comfort thee i have stores on my sumptermiulespoulardee and fishes and other not despicable comestibles and a few flasks of wine not pressed laud the saints  from the vines of this country wherefore wilt thou see to it and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer  no cooks have 1 to trust to replied the abbot  of cooking know they here as much as of latin natheless i will go and do my best with the stewpans meanwhile thou wilt at least have rest and the bath for the saxons even in their convents are a clean race and learned the bath from the dane  that i have noted said the knight  for even at the smallest house at which i have lodged in my way from london the host bath eourteonslv offered me the bath and the hostess linen curious and fragrant and to say truth the poor people are hospitable and kind despite their uncouth hate of the foreigner nor is their meat to be despised plentiful and succulent but pardex as thou sayest little helped by the art of dressing wherefore my father i will wile the time till the pomlardes be roasted and the fish broiled or stewed by the ablutions thou pfferaet me i shall tarry with thee some hours for i have much to learn  the abbot then led the sire de graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficientfor both norman and saxon hardy men as they seem to us from afar so shuddered at the touch of cold water that a bath of natural temperature as well as a hard bed was sometimes imposed as a penancethe good father went his way to examine the sumptermules and admonish the muchsuffering and bewildered laybrother who officiated as cookand who speaking neither norman nor latin scarce made out one word in ten of his superiors elaborate exhortations  mallets squire with a change of raiment and goodly coffers of soaps unguents and odours took his way to the knight for a norman of birth was accustomed to much per sonal attendance and had all respect for the body and it was nearly an hour before in a long gown of fur reshaven dainty and decked the sire de graville bowed and sighed and prayed before the refection set out in the abbots cell so the two normans despite the sharp appetite of the lay man ate with great gravity and decorum drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination sel dom more than tasting with looks of patient dissatisfaction each of the comestibles sipping rather than drinking nibbling rather than devouring washing their fingers in rosewater with nice care at the close and waving them afterwards gracefully in the air to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert as if recalling the polished manners of normandy still retained in that desolate exile and their temperate meal thus concluded dishes wines and attendants vanished and their talk commenced such another is the story of a contest in feats of strength and skill between duke william and harold when the latter went to normandy to claim the restoration of his kinsmen who had been hostages in williams hands  one day as during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging the normans were diverting their leisure with martial games in which taillefer shone preeminent while harold and william stood without their tent watching the animated field the duke abruptly exclaimed to mallet de graville  bring me my bow now harold let me see if thou canst bend it the bow was brought and saxon and norman gathered round the spot i fasten thy glove to yonder tree mallet said the duke taking that mighty bow in his hand and carefully feeling the string then he drew the arc to his ear and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock as the shaft piercing the glove lodged half way in the trunk i such are not our weapons said the earl  and ill would it become me unpractised so to peril our english ho nour as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow but that i may show these norman knights that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer bring me forth godrith my shield and my danish axe taking the shield and axe which the saxon brought to him haiold then stationed himself before the tree  now fair duke said he smiling i choose thou thy longest shaftbid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows round this tree will i move and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body i leave unguarded by my shield i no said william hastily  that were murder i it is but the common peril of war said harold simply and he walked to the tree i the blood mounted to williams brow and the lions thirst of carnage parched his throat  an he will have it so said he beckoning to his archers  let not normandy be shamed watch well and let every shaft go home avoid only the head and the heart such orgulous vaunting is best cured by bloodletting the archers nodded and took their post each at a separate quarter and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the earl for as he moved though he kept his back guarded by the tree some parts of his form the shield left exposed and it would have been impossible in his quickshifting movements for the archers so to aim as to wound but to spare life yet the earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye calmly bright even at the distance all the shafts of the archers at one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each that three fell to the ground blunted against it and two broke on its surface but william waiting for the first discharge and seeing full mark at harolds shoulder as the buckler turned now sent forth his terrible shaft the noble taillefer with a poets true sympathy cried i saxon beware but the watchful saxon needed not the warning as it in disdain harold met not the shaft with his sild but swinging high the mighty axe which with most men required both arms to wield it he advanced a step and clove the rushing arrow in twain  before williams loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield on the whole we should say that harold is an utter failure sir edward lytton is not the man for the task he has not a breath of the spirit of the middle ages within his breast and thus writes at haphazard when he would expound the motives and feelings of the personages of his story he sees nothing of their characters and conduct but a few external peculiarities unlike any thing that ever came across his own limited experience and associated in his mind with ideas with which they hand no real connexion whatsoever he has also adopted a foolsb medley of styles of composition which destroys the readableness ot his book as much as its incorrectness destroys its historical utility the result is that harold is about as much a picture of anglosaxon and norman times as lord eglintouns gimcrack tournament was a revival of the genuine sports of antique days added to this sir edward has been so worried by the critics of the press for the immoral tendencies of his previously publishied novel lucretia that he has determined to make harold a terribly moral  book and bhas converted the connexion between the saxon king and edith into a pure sentimental affection anmd this by way of historical accuracy  rzctxor iihrold the last of thie saxon kin lrs b3y sir e if lo rron hart in 3 vols ljondon 184s bentley iiaving received from sir e buser lytton a very polite note stating that he had requested his publisher to send us a copy of his harold for review wc should have felt some surprise that it had not reached ius hut that the same thing has occtirrcd in some halfdozen other instances proving that it is not an accidental neglect but the result of that unaccountable and strangely implacable hostility which tiie critic has from the beginning until now encountered from two or three publishers who have no cause that we are aware of for their enmity as we are not consciotus of having dealt with other than the most perfect fairness with any book to which their names have been appended luring the five years tniz critic has been fulfilling the duties of a literary journal that their hostility unkind and uncalled for as it is has not in any way affected our conduct towards them every reader can bear testimony for still have the hooks they publish received the same impartial notice and filled the same prominent kakce in our columns as if they had extended to us the same courtesy as they show to our other literary journal and as other publishers show to this although compelled to borrow their looks from circulating libraries they have not been either neglected or unjustly treated in our columns nor even if the same hostility be continued unmitigated will any different rule govern our conduct for the future we notice the fact now only because the present instance is a remarkable one and to account to the author and to our readers for a brevity of notice compelled by the inconvenient circumstances under which this review is written harold differs materially from any other of sir e b lyttons fictions it is in its design an epic and in its composition a chronicle the author has successfully endeavoured to combine the unity of the one with the individuality of the other the period chosen is peculiarly adapted for an epic whether in prose or in poetry the catastrophe is a great historical event gradually evolved out of the incidents that occupy the narrative the interest rises with every chapter and at the close becomes intense but sir e b lytrton has in this romance attempted much more than merely an attractive story he has sought to embody history to present an accurate as well as a vivid and lifelike picture of the times to realise them as it were to his readers imagination and to his own hence harold is something more than a sofabook it is a work for the study and might worthily take its place upon the historical shelf in the library so careful has been the author to preserve the strictest accuracy in the appointments of his romance that he has adduced at the bottom of the page the authorities from which his information is taken so laborious a work may not please the mere novelreader so much as a flimsy creation of the fancy but it will be more valued by those whose approval is most valuable and will secure for it a more lasting existence as it is a book which wvill be read by every body we will not attempt to anticipate their enjoyment by any account of the plot suffice it to observe that britons saxons normans and northmen are introduced with their several distinctive characteristics

professors welcome book dr holmes i holds a high place in the light literature of  america he is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists there is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what mrs j da pringle in gaits  ayrshire legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent with all this the story of iris approves dr holmes to be an american writerthe number of mysterious girls who figure in transatlantic fiction is appalling such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in germany where young

lc he said was al on asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that i shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way i followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking i might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity mighty close quarters they were where the young man john bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  barnum presenting

little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no

prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies practice walking the more graceful they become in their movements those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one a graceful correctionthe proper study of mankind is womanpunch woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and

the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great

should beto be of value and interest no attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull a great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a european reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be so she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  if i had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory i should have given up my project for i desired a distraction and not a laborious work hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  i regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work i have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair so writes the comtesse de boigne there is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote there is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production death plays too prominent a part when the comtesse de boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother after this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which i had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  i attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  the following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which i could hardly bear begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth and the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work she lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life in this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain there is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself the comtesse de boigne nee charlotte louise eleonore adelaide dosmond loved her name as well she might and she was childless from the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew osmond who became the marquis dosmond to be her heir he was ten years old in 1866 when she died he came into the possessions which she left him in august 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday with his intimate friend m charles nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world for twentyfive years they remained in the possession of m nicollaud to whom the marquis dosmond entrusted them during that time death was busy among the family and the marquis dosmond himself at length died  the family name is extinct the estate of osmond has been sold piecemeal the castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed but into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated what is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them she makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in london or the last days of the court at versailles or the bivouac of cossacks in the champs elysees at the restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of sir john legard with whom her family stayed in yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as chateaubriand or talleyrand or madame de stael or the emperor alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar the attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the tuileries where the ladies of the empire met the ladies of the old court after the return of monsieur there is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts the memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the revolution the empire and the restoration must be of supreme interest and value the translation is good and the notes which the editor m nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness the present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs the second volume bringing the narrative to the revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of louis philippe,biography
B5236,['6847150'],  the celebrated madame camfan lady in waiting to marie antoinette and confidant of napoleon by violette m montagu eveleigh nash 15s net hortense has a beautiful disposition we understand one another so perfectly were almost the last words of that survivor of hundreds of wrecked fortunes madame campan it was because she cottld see the beauty in the disposition of many such people as the queen of holland and because her quick and sympathetic nature enabled her to understand perfectly so many of her friends and pupils that she has become one of the most interesting figures in french social history in her wonderful and useful career are interwoven the symbolic bees of napoleon and the bourbon lilies of franceboth stained with the blood of the revolution and ofas it now seemsuseless wars long before we begin miss violette montagus wellarranged and admirably clear account of madame campan we are interested in her but all is newly set forth with skill and leisure from the birth of henriette genist and her acquaintance with the roi bienaime until the last line is penned and this remarkable woman lies in 1822 at peace at last in the cemetery at mantes the intention of the author of this book has been as she says to present a faithful picture of the france of the eil de boeuf and of that greater france when no education was considered complete without a sojourn in paris that parnassus whither napoleon the master mind invited the worlds most gifted artists musicians litterateurs scientists and thinkers this is a bold undertaking but one for which miss montagu would be perfectly fitted but for an occasional efflorescence of style and a slight inclination to wander from the matter in hand but as her more direct work  eugene de beauharnais proved she knows the vast numbers of memoirs of the period perfectly and is completely at ease in later eighteenth and early nineteenth century france while dealing with the fortunes of her heroine all the hurrying pushing palpitating world of louis xv louis xvi of the revolution of the napoleonic era and the confused time that followed are laid before us how low men were and how they rise how high they were and how they tumble o vanity of vanities o laughable pathetic jumble  that is the sort of picture one sees once more in miss montagus interesting pages it is true that much has been told to us before almost all the characters are historical but the author endows them with new life and adds a thousand little touches gathered from wide reading or personal observation which make her story of maman campanfor she was a mother to all the great or wouldbe great ladies of the empirefresh and delightful the reader of today need not trouble himself about the rather heavy and at the same time elusive volumes of memoirs which madame left us for miss montagu has adjusted the stilted style to modern taste the first part of the volume dealing with the court of marie ivntoinette is to some extent madame campans own work wisely edited and assisted by much knowledge gleaned from other and equally useful sources the second part which the author calls the governess of the bonapartes is founded on some of the correspondence between madame campan and the mother of napoleon iii who was of course under her care as hortense de beauharnais and among all her beloved pupils the most beloved the fates may not have allowed all the girls who were brought up by madame campan to prove later very kind or very clever but the governess at least saw that their minds and bodies were perfectly healthy while she could influence them and her carefully thought out methods certainly produced many capable witty women and caused a tradition of wise education to flourish in france even until today madame herself came of a family famous during generations for their taste for hard work and common sense for caution and in some cases coldness but the fine flower of their race the henriette of the present volume combined much knowledge of men and things with wide sympathy and much warmth of character with wisdom which was both lively and discreet from the days when a child lectrice she entered the court of louis xv as the companion of his daughters to the very end she held in her heart the spirit of a devoted and unselfish mother and although her own marriage made by her parents of coursewas unhappy she never failed to make lighter the burdens which others had to bear at fourteen miss montagu says her heroine was in danger of becoming a bluestocking for she was quick and clever and made much of by the various masters of the arts of the day albanesi the most fashionable of singing masters taught her the melodies of the alluring lully while goldoni himself made her familiar with italian the little picture of her as she comes into prominence shows that the bluestocking period was soon over miss montagu pictures her entering the great world wearing a long train her slender figure enclosed in stiff stays and voluminous panniers with her little tearstained face besmirched with rouge and powder her father had given her many wise warnings whenever you receive flattering attentions he said you will gain an enemy of flattery and enemies madame campan had her fair share as the years passed but her head was always cool and her heart true and sound and thus she survivedthe friend of humanity through so many and such various periods of court life her character and her surroundings make her a particularly interesting subject for such a volume as miss montagu gives us it is the life of a wise and sympathetic woman written by anotherand such an alliance will always make a delightful book,biography

B1967,['9087693'],  black magic  pfr amica silentia lunve   is a book for the yeats enthusiast that is to say we should not recommend it to any one who has anything else of mr yeatss still to read a man who knows only  innisfree and  the heavens embroidered clothes  may be left happily with the rest of the poems with the  stories of red hanrahan and should he wish to know something of the poets life with the exquisite  reveries over childhood and youth in  per amica silentia luna mr yeats is less often exquisite than affected it is not his genius that he reveals to us here but some curious crannies of his mind of course mr yeatss mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind and well worth exploring  but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about there are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle here for instance are two consecutive sentences  one night i heard a voice that said   the love of god for every human soul is infinite for every human soul is unique  no other can satisfy the same need in god our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death but only that we should seek it in those who are dead even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom they need mr george robeys interpreting  in other words to simplify them they are the means however by which mr yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts there was no need for mr yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of per amica silentia luna by w b yeats macmillan  co 45 dd net words we are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it mr yeats says   i have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of indian and japanese poets old women in connaught mediums in soho because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world we wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says   faith is the one gift that man can make to god it is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following   all souls have a vehicle or body and when one has said that with more and the platonists one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some church or institution and found oneself with great poetry and superstition which is but popular poetry in a pleasant dangerous world mr yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions he is saying what he means however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose he believes that every great man has a demon to mingle with his life it is a daemon literally and not figuratively speaking who inspires every man of genius the demon who is the creator of the work of art mr yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement and divides them from one another under the names of self and antiself self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses antiself is the daemon maker of a thing far greater than the man himself it is in his attempted explanation of his belief that mr yeats like other theologians breaks down he bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal he experiences what one would describe if one were speaking of oneself as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself mr yeats describes his sensation thus  when i come home after meeting men who are strange to me and sometimes even after talking to women i go over all i have said in gloom and disappointment perhaps i have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle from hostility that is but fear or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy my fellow  diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity and how should i keep my head among images of good and evil crude allegories r how indeed  did not charles lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellowguest had the misfortune to ask if milton was a great poet   but when i shut my door and light my candle i invite a marmorean muse an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different for now there must be no reaction action only and the world must move my heart but to the hearts discovery of itselfall my thoughts have ease and joy i am all virtue and confidence it is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that mr yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work he will not accept the commonplace idea that this  heroic condition  is his true self he regards it rather as  the lord of terrible aspect  who appeared to dante and said  egodominus tuus  the descent of the demon who when the moment of creation comes makes for mr yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius  when i consider the minds of my friends says mr yeats  among artists and emotional writers i discover a like contrast and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work there is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse but with women or liquor in their lives  and mr yeats refers to dantes lechery and shakespeares  pottle pot  with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate but this division into self and antiself is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind it is impossible to divide personality with a butchers cleaver one may get interesting generalisation as the result but one will not get truth if mr yeatss theory were correct psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose the elements of a mans nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air and the air with the veining branches of the tree,biography

the russoturkish war of 1877 madame yerestchagin occupies a large portion of the book with an accountwhich is most characteristic and cleverly written and by no means overcharged with admiration for the english  of her journey with her husband through india in the gentlemans narrative we have him as he sees himself while the lady supplies a picture which does not differ materially from her husbands portrait the artists love for colour and energetic motives which was manifest in the pictures he exhibited at the grosvenor gallery is displayed on every page travelling through central asia as an attache of general kaufmann m yerestchagin enjoyed peculiar privileges and he bears emphatic testimony to the decrease of slavery under the dominion of his countrymen not only in the territories they have annexed where slavery is forbidden and where the markets no longer exist but in the neighbouring states where the natives believe  not without reason that the russians may come any day and pay them a visit and mercilessly release the slaves as they always do wherever they go domestic castigation much affected by the natives is less rife than of yore the end of the world is coming cried our authors landlord with a gesture of despair  how so    why what else is one to expect when a husband may no longer correct his wife  if you beat her she threatens to go to the russians in fact the unpatriotic ladies appeal to caesar not often in vain they do not seem to be innocent of intrigues and gossipvices which according to the traveller are due to the degraded social state of creatures who are confined to merely animal functions and disfigured physically by the labour of a beast of burden in central asia the townswomen are worse off than in persia and turkey but the nomads are freer one of the most interesting and remarkable sections of this book is devoted to the public displays of dancing boys tamasha which occur at the feast of beiram it is too long for extract but will be found on pp 105110 of vol i the complex and comprehensive system of pauperism obtaining at tashkend in central asia is almost worthy of a subsidised irish parish the account of it is followed by notices of opiumeaters among the sarts not materially different from what we know the kirghiz falconers are a most picturesque set and they carry their birdsgolden eagles the text calls themhooded with leather and upon their hands they cast them off in the mediaeval fashion and use them to kill foxes hawks are employed in a similar manner how russia has crept upon china is shown in many passages of the book in none more clearly than the following the south tarbagotai detachment of 130 cossacks largely armed with flint muskets dating from the beginning of the century and two guns was in 1870 on the frontier near the little river bachty this frontier was very like what farmers in surrey and hampshire whose land abuts on common land felicitously call  a rolling fence the detachment was originally quartered in urdshar  whence it has moved gradually forward till it has reached its present station and has thus extended the russian frotier by about 100 versts between 1850 and 1860 many districts in the neighbourhood of urdshar still belonged to the chinese now they have not a single acre of land within a radius of 100 versts thus russia grows from day to day nay from hour to hour  but if it goes on growing like this adds m yerestchagin drily the consequences will be serious here is what our author saw of the results of the mohammedan rebellion against the chinese government in the region of tchugutchak   presently large clumps of trees were visible in the distance on both sides of the road marking the farms of which there were many round tchugutchak about two versts outside the town we baw several ruined houses and chapels the paintings on the walls were still uninjured some splendid old trees were still standing but quite dead for the irrigation canals are silted up and the soil is quite dry in the town similar sights meet the eye wonderful groves and avenues the work of years are sometimes completely destroyed or going to decay as you approach the town it is hard to believe it is empty  you cannot help hoping to meet some human being if it be only a robber but not a soul is to be seen anywhere the houses are for the most part uninjured and likewise the paintings on the walls and the wooden latticework of the windows potsherds and fragments of articles of every conceivable kind were lying all aboutvessels of iron and clay of all sizes a quantity of copper coins strung on a string dresses caps plaits of hair shoes of all sizes the clumsy bhoes of dunghans and calmucks side by side with the miniature slippers of chinese women 1 put a

terrible i wandered about for a whole day in bs company and then for several days alone without being able to accustom myself to this stillness as of the grave and to the sight of all these streets chapels theatres and squares standing for ever empty the gate of the fortress which the besiegers had blown in is still tolerably strong near the gate is to be seen the entrance into the subterranean gallery by which the besiegers after a long and tedious siege made their way into the fortress then came a merciless butchery in which no one was spared skulls and bones lie literally in heaps against the walls here and all around the fortress at many points e g by several of the gates the skulls were piled up to a great height in the fields round the town too lie skulls  as far as the eye can reach skulls and skulls and again skulls the wolves and the jackals have already done their work  the ravens are still engaged in picking the bones clean for the sun and rain to bleach one of the farms in particular which lie nearest the town abounds in bones a body of calmucks fifteen thousand strong came this way to help the besieged  but a force of only a few hundred dunghans fell upon them drove them back and killed them to the very last man what wonderful energy on the part of the insurgent mohammedans what cowardice on the part of the chinamen  i had enough to occupy me from the

version also excellent we dwelled upon the story at too great a length to recur to it now but we cannot avoid remarking it as a great advantage that the presidents daughters may here be purchased apart from its sequelnina it is complete in itself and one of the best of miss bremers tales how beautiful is adelaide throughout and what a charming scene the closing reconciliation of the lovers with its incident of the cherries so prettily stolen from la fontaine nina we confess is greatly less to our taste and seems to us more filled with miss bremers peculiar faults than any other in her

extensively read little is known however of her personal history and it is to be regretted that her english translator has not taken the trouble to collect a few particulars concerning the life of an author who occupies so remarkable a position we believe miss bremer was born to affluence but troubles have fol leu heavily on her family and reduced her in the spring of life to a state of dependence upon her friends who move in the best circles of the capital her genius has thus been prompted to exertion by adversity and many touching allusions to her own circumstances may be found scattered through her productions she resides chiefly at stockholm the secret ot her success lies in that truthfulness f delineation which whatever form it takes or in v hat ever manner it makes itself manifest is always siru to strike home to the heart of a people she mes nothing to art and everything to the depth aud seriousness of a resolute purpose she is the least skilful ol all living novelists she has no notion of consiructiiii a narrative on anv inlelligie principle of arrangement she never dreams of  mhveiing a series tlincidents in natural sequence willi her the end arul aim of thc design is to work out thoronuhly and sincerely the whole passion of the subject h fore her without embarrassing her progress willi any reference to what has gone before or what is likely to follow how she succeeds in raising though edifice and finally roofing it must be a grave puzzle to the aesthetic critics of germany  for she may be fairly compared to an architect uho builds a house without scaffolding vet her looks arc nevertheless solid and symmetrical in relation to their ultimate object and like all truths lound in strong feelings and fixed conviction have an innate energy in them that overrules criticism her novels are not novels of plot or costume hut of character and observation lier knowledge of human nature is profoundol human nature as it is dewhmed in the world and acted upon by worldly influences she paints society with a wisdom rarely brought to bear upon domestic scenes and she unveils with such clearness and courage the mixed emotions that throb beneath the surface that the reader derives from the reality of hr pictures a sort of artificial experience of life the volumes before us contain two talcs or more properly a family chronicle divided into two parts the faults which were so prominent in miss brewers former publications are even more conspicuous in this the interest is broken up and distributed amongst a greit variety of persons the narrative is a progress through a succession of events rather than a compact story the individuals who move in it are strongly contrasted and some of them are drawn in sheer wilful excess  in the matter of plot there is a tendency to extravagance and romance which is strangely irreconcilable with the good sense and cultivated taste of the author  and if we add that there is too much german mysticism and too much of that socalled artenthusiasm which deals so largely in loose abstractions as to bc nearly unintelligible we shall have discharged our conscience of every grain of objection that has settled upon it during a careful perusal of these volumes but how large a balance of praise remains to oe counted up the minute fidelity of the details the vivid distinctness with which every mental struggle and secret emotion is traced the moral beauty and womanly purity which steadily illuminate thc narrative and thc calm christian philosophy out of which all its earnest lessons of truth anil justice and resignation and serene wisdom arc drawn must receive implicit admiration on all hands the style occasionally perhaps a little too florid is generally eloquent and appropriate and much as she crowds thc scene with figures miss bremer possesses beyond any other living writer of her cuss the power of realising to the imagination every individual she introduces there is scarcely a single person in her tumultuous groups that does not stand out palpably in his lning lineaments the presidents daughters occupies only the first volume nina the youngest of the family engrosses the remaining two the president is a widower with four daughters and we are introduced on the very threshold of the narrative to this fair household on whose fortunes the whole story revolves the narrator is the governess to whose charge the orphan are consigned  the first wat a tall thin figure with a remarkably plain countenance and stiff and unpleasing demeanour she curtseyed coldly and reservedly and was presented by her lather as  edi  adelaide mas then named and a yoong lovely creature approached me and beaming with smiles blushingly embraced me i thought i had never seen anything more bewitching  chickens

these the little ones began as it were to thaw and presently i wag covered with their carts their dolls and their castles as well as being informed in confidence that they thought mv nose very large  in the meantime i paid attention to the president who was conversing with his two elder daughters adelaide related to her father the events of the daythe dinner company and the dishes edla added a remark or two and even sometimes upon her sisters words the president marvelled much at the mixture of  chicken and cauliflower for my part i could not take my eyes from adelaide she struck me as indescribably beautiful and pleasing her countenance was more round than oval the forehead high and finely arched the nose small and exquisitely formed whilst a pair of large dark blue eyes beamed with joy and goodheartedness and the roses of health tinged both her lips and her cheeks her smile nay her whole manner was such as we ascribe to a cherub she was ot middle height her figure finely moulded and her carnage noble  her neck her arms and hands dazzlingly white and of the most perfect form her head whichwas adorned with rich chesnutbrown hair she carried a little thrown back which gave her an appearance of haughtiness nay almost of arrogance  nor was this contradicted by her manner however softened that might be by an expression of sincere sweetness and goodwill beside this brilliant figure her sister showed like a shadow and i suspected that it was her own sense of this which made her so gloomy the foundations of the subsequent interest are visibly laid in these portraits kdla plain reserved and melancholy has no share in her fathers affections the worthy president is a man of conventions and without being conscious of an injustice is devotedly fond of the beautiful adelaide a morose spirit is gradually engendered in the heart of the neglected edla and from ont step to another the distance between her and lier father widens into distrust and aversion passing over a long interval let us come to the sequel it is evening the company juc assembled in the drawingroom and adelaide has just sung a song about  home the subject is a dangerous one 44  a home  said count w softly as he crossed his arms on his breast and bowed his head 4 a home with a beloved wifeit is in truth a heaven 444 yes said the president  and with an amiable daughter who in everything seeks to please her father and provides so tenderly for his comfort and enjoyment 44 the tone in which this was said and the sharp glance he cast upon edla caused ali eyes to turn upon her she coloured violently i am certain that the president immediately repented his hasty and unfriendly words  but what was said was said and edlas embittered feelings roe hastily to a decree which i should have thought with her to be impossible she turned to count alarik and said  44 4 you have compared home to a heaven do you know what else it may resemble  44 lie looked questioningly upon her and she continued 4 a house of correction 44 i shuddered at these bitter words the president started so that the tea was shaken out of his cup count alarik regarded kdla seriously and reproachfully 44 kdla continued with violent excitement  there is an overseer and there are prisoners the fonner assigns work to the latter and when they neglect it he punishes them he exacts the fulfilment of duties but gives neither the tenderness nor the joy which makes duty light but why complain of it v she added casting up a glance full of anger and despair  the lesser life is but a counterpart of the higher and home is an image of the worlds order 44 i miss kdla said count alarik warningly 44 the president was violently affected but restrained himself and turning to count alarik said with a specious calmness4 is it not wonderful my dear count that man so often embitters his own days and then complains impatiently at the suffering he has himself causer  my late  wife the president became moved as he almost always did when he named her  poor frederica made me  s the happiest of husbands  if she had lived she would like i  wise have made me a happy father for she would have  taught her daughters that mildness and concession which j alone can gain love she would have taught them to deserve   a fathers tenderness who desired nothing better than to see all his children happy around him and to clasp them a to his bosom i  the president was moved and evidently ready for reconciliation not so edla the long pentup poison of bitterness was boiling up in her 444 love alone she said  wins return of love that father who gave his child life and did not give it tenderness and does not give it joy has no right to make any claims no right said the president with warmth and too excited to be able to weigh his words  no right but vou you can never be wron you must always he right but it i have no right to claim from you some compliance and obedience i have at least a right to free myself and my house from discomfort and disquiet for the last three years you have not given me one single joyful day  you have yourself evidently shown that you despise your fathers counsel and dislike his house if in future this does not become other than it has been heretofore then it is best thatthat we part  it will then be my affair said edla coldly and growing pale to give place i shall soon no longer give discomfort or disquiet to any one  she arose laid aside her work and was about to go count alarik seized her arm  child  said he softly no precipitance miss edla you are wrong bethink yourself 44 she stopped and looked wildly at him  what shall i do she asked m yon have been wrong confess it beg your fathers forgive neaii m  no i saki abe violently as she sought to disengage her arm bat count

this most charming book which like the picture suggests a scotch jane austen much more janeaustenish than susan ferrier its author elizabeth grant was born in edinburgh may 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in bombay cathedral to col afterwards general henry smith of baltiboys lived thereafter in ireland and died november 16th 1885 she was the eldest of the five

peter the only son of a doctor had succeeded in 1790 to the rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle he was an edinburgh advocate and london barrister sat as whig member for grimsby and

griffith one of her numberless cousins was master in london again in edinburgh and in india they have already been privately printed and now are generously given to the world with a brieftoo briefintroduction by a niece lady strachey no book of the kind has proved more delightful  if ever i write a novel mrs smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten inspector and received 40 in return that rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel as it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past here is one that is truly wordsworthian the young people were not of rothiemurchus they lived up in glen feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married he was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man i am not sure which but his business was to mind a large hock that pastured on the mountainsat the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty the wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening she would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  my goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  ay but i like the bite replied the creature the book is not purely highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown the future lady byron burnss bonnieleslie one of the cleverest women of her age mrs thrale catalani mrs siddons sir augustus deete the original we believe of harry richmonds father basil hall john clerk of eldin jeffrey canning the abbe sieves and many more emerge and disappear in connexion with prince augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty still after all we like the highland folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it the account of the old edinburgh society is entertaining she classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary she met all varietiesthe jeffreys sir david brewster  the crazy lord buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of queen marys and a bone of james the fifth harry erskine john clerk of eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and sir walter himself there is also a welldrawn portrait of canning whom she met in holland she is most fearless in confessing her opinions she confesses that she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  a coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the dukes arms at dunkeld to blair during the summer season the announcement read as follows pleasing intelligence the duchess of athol starts every morning from the  dukes arms at eight oclock the other is told of lord eldin  some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the west country celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument  wi an epitaph said john clerk in his broadest border

labours of his literary lifehis poems covering a period of forty yearsfrom 1816 to 1857commencing when byron had only begun to assert himself before keats had published and when shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny when wordsworth and coleridge had few readers and when it was perversely held that poetry should be modelled on something that had gone before the varied reputations made iu forty years never seduced mr story from the path he originally chose beginning life as a northumberland herdboy he was  literally charmed by dr watts but springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration he dashed into a style resembling the minor flights of burns then as now most keenly loved and appreciated amongst an otherwise unread northern peasantry his poems are dated and usually have some two or three lines of historical gossip which give interest because clearly carrying truth the first poems are all lovemary k to the same to the same by the dozen when

showing that a countess may be a mean hardhearted scheming old womana marquis an empty coxcomb who talks very iudifflerenit englishand that the officers of the guards gentlemen of the clubs titled young ladies of the nobilitys ballrooms are essentially the same beings as those young bucks old fogies and pretty flirts the natives of much inferior social circles higher up are better manners certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of english society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design perhaps mr thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern english aristocratic society his pictures most likely are not faultless whose are a line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation a man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation and now what is the nature of this fashionable world according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   vanity fair  pendennis  newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one the land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life mr thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that haut tonne is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of haut tonne can present us for the most part with such elements as these is the marquis of steyne a representative personage and his sister lady kew and the most noble farintosh is miss ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and lord kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman does love among these upper clwases usually signify flirtation and life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the world a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand marriage a convenient arrangement and religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like potichomanie and death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones self a still more disagreeable occurrenceare these the polite definitions l it would appear so perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes but do the middle get off any better rather worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of vanity fair than themselves a doleful and depressing view of human nature surely true we have mr pendenniss mother and lady walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have mr pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model i wife and worship him the colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of mr i thackerays creations we can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement with tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample of a young man handsome lively clever generous goodnaturednon ursiteris extra hle drinks his full share smokes immensely idles in the familiar rooms of warrington and mr pendennis and talks slang there and at the haunt where fred bavham and others have late beer and lobster likes sketching and does it semiprofessionally goes to baden and rome idles there and lets his beard grow falls in love with his cousin the beautiful flirt wishes himself a marquis or duke and hates those who are sulks over his fathers indulgence marries a plump scotch girl and her mother and becomes permanently disgusted with existence in his companion the youngpainter john james tidley mrthackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin the application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to truth with a smile or a wink to fashion in the same moment  praising pilgrim and faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in nuditty fair the chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 vol i p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us there is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in the newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as the kickleburys fur instance which the times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination,biography
B6443,"['8510530', '3171337', '9027307', '6673337', '3203165']",  the poetical work8 of edgar allans poe illus trated edinburgh alexander hislop and co it is one of the misfortunes attendant upon the absence of an international copyrightlaw between this country and america that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an american author in decent type and paper the reason is obvious the market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions that render such an effort much too risky hence it is that american literature whichwith all deference be it spokenshould not scorn adventitious aids is generally associated with dirty grey paper bad type small size and insecure binding let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read romeo juliet published in the form of a dirty tract which may be had in holywell street for twopence let him turn to his own large clear wellprinted edition and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace and light and sweetness that it did not possess before we are glad to perceive therefore that edgar allan poe unquestionably the greatest genius that america has yet producedis at length offered to english readers in a handy and presentable form with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper but it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems failure might have been anticipated at the beginning it was a priori as impossible to translate the dreamlike beauty of annabel lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano the illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e g one or two chaming little landscapes by mr macwhirter but to begin at the beginning did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than mr c j staniland has done with the  raven did mr staniland fancy that this was a comic poem  we find a hideously ugly boy seated in an annchair before a fire the room being filled with ghouls and spirits that remind us of the mnagic weene in der pieibchutz done iu a cuwtlty theatre what these tawdry devils have to do with the weird simplicity of the poem we are at a loss to make out but this is nothing to the final scneu in which the boy is found lying on the floor with a merry imp presumably representing hearthurn or nightame sitting on his chest we forgive mr s hlaad for not being aie

cut out the book would have been better but as it stands it is the best edition of poes poems we know of  the complete works of bret harte collected and revised by the author vol x tales of trail and town 6s chatto and windus the library edition of the works of bret harte is now complete in ten volumes the publishers have done their part well so far as binding and type are concerned though some readers may regret that none of the excellent illustrations which have adorned the earlier editions appear in the new one many reputations have been made and have passed since bret harte gave us the luck of roaring camp and hardly one has stood the test of constant production like his he is now what he was in his early days a writer of excellent stories with a sense of fine workmanship which he has never outraged the present volume contains tales that have already from a photo by john ruskin i886 bari aud proved their power of giving delight but mostly of a recent enough date to be still new to many readers  the poetical works of edgar allan poe with a notice of his life and genius by james hannay 1 esq with twenty illustrationssome of these twenty illustrations are gracefully fantastic the biographical notice is perversely sentimental the story of poes life was told by himself so largely and loudly to the public by the daily papers of america that to attempt to colour over its shames with sympathy and apology is idle the poems with their strange unwholesome unequal vigour nightmare verses if such things can be speak for themselves their writer apart from his works had best be forgotten  literature the works of edgar allan poe edited by john h ingram vols i and ii containing the collected tales london and edinburgh adam  charles black 1874 with jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although mr ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume i do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if i were just a little more mad than ever i waswe can say frankly this is what i am there is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  ligeiaas tothe expression of ligcias eyes he tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj though glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories they are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable if anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable circumstances  the gold bug  the descent into the maelstrom  the cask of amontillado  the oval portrait and the three stories about c auguste dnpin the philosophical detective if he should then desire to read more he may go on but warily there are trapdoors and springguns in these two volumes there are gins and pitfalls and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten one word on the services of mr ingram this edition has evidently been a labour of love with him let us hope in the next two volumes which are to complete the series he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of french which poe was so fond of scattering about his pages there are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under

B4583,['6727320'],  literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by

B4665,['6727320'],  literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by the irony of the fates and powers or baulked at the very finish in the  head of the district a dying main sees his wife crossing the river to meet him and knows that she will come too late and his

B2250,"['4372131', '9428028', '8485575']",  reviiws of books our mutual frien mr dickens has now been so long before the public and his name is associated with so many triumphs some of which were achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born that he has already obtained the position of a classic and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time he has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood the collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes the characters he has invented would almost people a town and we might well excuse an author who has done so much if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time but mr dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having outwritten himselfl his fancy his pathos his hmour his wonderful powers of observation his picturesqueness and his versatility are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago in some respects they are seen to still greater advantage the energy of youth yet remains but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years not that we mean to say mr dickenshas outgrown his faults they are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard a certain extr vagnce in particular scenes and personsa tendency to caricature and grotesquenessand a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic as if the author had been considering how the thiqwroulld  tell  on the stageare to be found in  our mutual fried as in all this great novelists productions but when a writer of genius has fully settled his style and maintained it through a core of many yerswhen his mind has pused beyond the period of pliability and growth and ca only deepen without essenthlly angingit is the merest vanity on the part of a critic to dwdl at any great length on general faults of manner there they are ma there they will remamy ws hat we will the tender rind wein they were cut in youth has become hard bark ong ice and the incisions are fixed for ever to rail at them is simple wa of time besides implying a great deal of iatitude on the part of the railer we shall therefore make but br allsi here to th characters of wegg and venus who appeartous in he high degree unnaturalthe one being a mere phantasm and the other a nonentityand shall pass on to a c eran of the ore solidprts of the book in which mr dickenss old mastery over huma nature is once more made splendidly apparent 1s n its authors previous fictions we are almost oppressed by the frilness of life which pervades the pages of this novel mr dicmja oneof the most mysterious attributes of geniusthe powner of reatng characters which have so to spea an overplus df vtality passing beyond the limits of the tale and ming itlf felti li actual ext al t in the stories of inferior wntees the eseem to posst jsuffiient personality and presece todry on the purpose of the narrtive one never thinks of them an wpoying any existence at all outside the little tissue of events taun been woven for them they ae goes whom the author has evoked out of iht and vauity to erform certain definite offics within the charmed circle of the tion to which they are attacbed and when we step out of that circle at the conclusin of 4w ceremonies they vanish again into not aness ad we thin no more of them such is not the case wit the concep tions of larger geniuses thee do not seem to belong wholly to the one set of events with which they are associated any more than the men and women we actually kow pent themselves to our thoughts as the puppets of a definite train of circumstances the creations of authors such as mr dickens have a life of their own we perceive them to be full of potential capacities of madevelaped action they have the substance and the freedom of awla exiatences we think of what they would do under other conditions they are possessed of a riniple of growth ctaiy themost amazing manifestation of this amng gift is that which o be fornd in the ply of slakepeare  but ull men of genius ave it in a greater or degree anhat strange and even awful wmr isperhap the et test for distinguishing beteeeng aid talent that mr dickens poseus it to a remarkable extent  bdifve few will be found to dipute the chief character even of his earlier books dwell in te mind with extraordinary  thacity sometimes quite apart from the plot wherein they figurn which may be utterly fogott and no writer of our time has furnished contemporary literature and conversationwi so many ibsjrative allusions this ite fecundity is seen in tr mutual friend  in undimin d strength the book teems i m cteis and throbs with action but it may perk be that there is a want of wme one conspicu1ous fig u uting over the rext and affording a fixed centre to all this mmving wealth of life john rokesmith must we suppose be regdd as the hero but he is certainly not the chis character nor ho most interesting though in many respects welldrawn he does not greatly enlist our sympathiespe because his motives of seton are strange and improbable indeed the whole st of old harmons be quest and what arises out of it stie w as being faulty this we are aware is to proca a serious defect in the novel as such since we have here the bais of the whol fiction but mr dickenss collatel ooneeptious are often  eamatual friend by charles dickens two mok lmdou chap a hail  better than his main purpose we must confogs that in rgaina our mutual friend from month to month we cared very little as to what became of old harmons property excepting in asrfares the ultimate disposal of that sordid aggregation of wealth affectd the development of two or three of the chief characters theind explanation is a disappointment the whole plot in which the deceased harmon boffin wegg and john rokeemith are concerned is wild and fantastic wanting in reality and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story mr dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection for in the very interesting  postscript in lieu of preface which he has appended to the second volume he says there is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact therefore i note here though it may not be at al necessay that there are hundreds of will cases as they are called far more remarkable than that fancied in this book and that the stores of the prerogative office teem with instances of testators who have made changed contradicted hidden forgotten left cancelled and leftuncancelled each many more wills than were ever made by the elder mr harmon of harmony jail we do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact and it is not to the terms of mr harmons will that we object but to the circumstances flowing from that source that the son john harmon known through the greater part of the book as john rokesmith should come baok to gland under the circunstances related should disappear as related should live for months at the house of his childhoods friends the boffins without being discovered and should then be suddenly found out without any sucint explanation that mr boffin should get entangled with a man ie wegg  that grantingthe entanglement wegg with all his c should make his calcations with such transparent stupidityfkig no account of the dutch bottle which he has seen dug up by from the dustheap and which contains as the reader all an foresees the later will which nullifies the will relied on by we for forcn boffin to give up half his property that the 6ome and insolent tatment of rokesmith by boffin and the miserliness of the latter maintained at all times and people should be a mere trick concocted between the two b turn the regards of proud little bella wilfer towards john ana to cure the young lady of her sordid aspirati a that all th when the right moment arrives should be verbally set forth s those exlantion which we fid at the end of plays wheni he characters ran themselves before the footlights make they confessions ad unravel the imbroglio these are features in r dickenss story which we cannot but regard as in the bight degree improbable and as detracting from the merit the 1 as a whole the explanation guven towards the close of  miserly ways and speeches of mr boffin is partictlarly unsatils tory for it has the effect of making what would otherwina bee a very masterly developmt of character cpmttvly my forced and aficial mr bffin is introduced to the reader x  man of a fine open genial though rohand uncultivated natur but under

couldnt abear to see and hear me coming out a rglar brown one mr boffins designation for a bear  couldnt abear to make believe as i meant it in consequence of which we was everlastingly in danger with her we venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up the termination of mr dickenss novels is often hurried and such is the case in the present instance the complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process but is so to speak roughly tonne open and even before we are half through the book the mystery concerning john rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner young rokesmith or harmon tells himself his own previous history in a sort of mental soliloquy in which a long series of events is minutely narrated evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader it is surprising that so experienced a romancewriter as mr dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design yet notwithstanding these defects which we have pointed out with the greater freedom because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic the story of  our mutual friend is interesting for its own sake even apart from its treatment which we need not say is that of a master if we except these points already objected to we repeat what we said at the commencementthat in conception and evolution of character and in power of writing this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw considered on artistic grounds are eugene wrayburn lizzie hexam bradley headstone and bella wilfer the first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature originally noble degenerating under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness into a laughing indifference to all things worthyinto a gay and sportive disbelief in itself in manhood in womanhood and in the world from first to last the conception is wonderfully developed and the change that is afterwards wrought in eugenes disposition is worked out without the smallest violence in strong contrast with the goodnatured levity of wrayburn is the stern selfcontained narrow yet within its contracted and mechanical limits earnest nature of bradley headstone the selfeducated schoolmaster liue hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact she is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can getdead bodies among the restand who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess the girl  however is a fine sensitive being handsome and of a deep tender nature and when eugene wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver he takes an interest in her fate and has her educated his interest deepens into love yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage bradley headstone also is in love with lizzie and the way in which his impassive artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love jealousy and some pungent taunts which wrayburn gaily flings at him is exhibited by mr dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness the transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark haggard selftormenting evil genius per tually dogging the steps of eugene wrayburn and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river is one of the finest things in fiction bradley headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest and we are peruaded of the profoundest truth natures like his originally cold and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of selfcontrol mr dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of bradley headstones wrath in the attempted murder of eugene all the preparations for that at and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions are managed in mr dickenss highest style and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness we are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake of nature to which novelists should be superior that this carcter is sensational  but the genius that could conceive it has dothilg to fear from such objectors very touching and beautifsl the character of lizzie hexam but probably the greatest favourite in the book will beor rather is alreadybella wilfer she is evidently a pet of the authors and she will long r m the darling of half the households of england and america pererse petulant wil wrongheaded not a little inclined at first to be selfish and aneyloving she is yet a bewitching little creare and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak they are so numerous but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of betty higden and little johnny her gre andchild that the poor old creatures pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from mr dickens in the final words from which we have already quoted a declaration of his views on the present administration of the poor laws  in my social experiences since mrs betty higden came upon the scene and left it i have found circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the poor law my friend m1r bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and i have been called upon to admit that i would give poor law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow patting this nonsense aside i have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some union houses the other admitting that there are such pcor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do the records in our newspapers the late exposure by the lancet and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences but that my view of the poor law may not be amk or misrepresented i will state it i believe there has been in england since the days of the stuarts no law so often infimously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised in the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanityand known language could say no more of their lawlessnes we must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls dressmaker fantastic and semipoetical yet with a deep instinct of truth her drunken fathera sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein mr dickens is quite unrivalled bellas father a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature the podsnaps and veneerings and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers male and female by whom they are surroundedportraits admirable for the social satire they embody rogue riderhood and some of the other hangerson about the river we might almost mention the river itself as a character it plays a most important part in the story and always with great picturesqueness we cannot refain ere we

afford to lose such a writer as mr dik a man of original creative genius dying in the fulnes of bis strength leaves a gap which nothing can fill and a regt which the memory of his past triumphs only deepens and embitter  our mutual friend by charles dickens with illustrations by marcus stone 2 vols chapman  hall a new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture or of qualification for a simple yet serious reason those who with understanding as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise have followed mr dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him carelesswhether as concerns his art his public or himself as little have they spoilt or dimmed or turned aside his quick sympathies his power of minute observation his keen desire to advocate what he deems right his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success the boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture but may he not ponder too long and oversolicitously  this question we fancy may be asked with respect to  our mutual friend only the other day ita author gave us that french story of little bebelle one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with sternes shandyisms only yesterday out of a dingy street in the strand from no more promising place than a lodginghouse the artist by a touch brought to light a homely loving fellowcreature worthy to  sit above the salt among the best of the best mrs lirriperas real  a being of the mind  as mr pickwick as mrs gamp as the micaivbersas any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist whom we know intimately in all their strength and weakness and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words if therefore we say that during its course of fragmentary publication  our mutual friend has raised more question than certain of its predecessors the circumstance arises from the nature of the story and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion none of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale it would be wasted labour to detail or analyse a chain of events which every one has already handled enough to state our conviction that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links from the first number it was evident to us that the murdered john harmon was not murdered but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will for the purpose of testing her real nature the circumstances of the deed which led to his shipmate radfoot being mistaken for and murdered with himself are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity some incompleteness referable to partial recollection may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelists partmay belong to the nature of the catastrophe but it produces an impression of uncertainty then again the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises which bear unfavourably on some of the characters we fancy the conversion of bella wilfer the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister to be somewhat too suddeneven though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing mr boffin this avarice again however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared has of necessity implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched the honest truthful boffin of the mounds whose simple rightmindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of bella the oddlydesignated bride ofthe great fortune but his inability to carry such a longdrawn piece of subtle comedy through we beg respectfully to our great novel ist to question and we are satisfied that bo greathearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever or any desire to lead on a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with wegg after the discovery of old harmons second mil in the house of the anatomical curiositymonger that which belongs and befits a detective policeman apt at disguises as mr bucket of nevertobeforgotten memory sits ill on an honest ignorant affectionate creature such as he is and though we love mrs boffin the comfortable and instinctivelydelicate woman one of mr dickenss most genial creations with all our hearts we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance truth and nature are here strained in subservience to the requirements of literary art we fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story harmon its hero is by his position betwixt light and dark inevitably partially effaced bella the coquetish daughter of mrs wilfer the stupendous is capitally touched in the chameleon hues of her character and royally righted at last but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring then lizzie hexam though not precisely a sketch has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the readers interest lastly we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy humble affectionate and beneficent as riah the hebrew on any grounds of compact obligation or sophistry lending himself one hour after it was known to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as fledgeby the usurer the meanest creature this is saying much as yet created by the hand that painted the moneylenders in  nickleby and brats and kroolc and fagin and uriah heep the explanation made by him at last to the little weird dolls dressmaker shows us that mr dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation which is insufficient to convince us we cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness somewhat similar in miss edgeworths  ormonda tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom  every man has his hand thus much by way of qualificationor call it speculation ratherconcerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without stop let or hindrance on returning to the characters that of bradley headstone the schoolmaster dogged sensual unreadyhis tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position takes the foremost place among them as an original conception frightfully though he suffers even though when he confronts wrayburn his pococurante rival there is a show of reason and of championship on his side there is no possibility of any ones feeling a moments pity on his behalf so utterly is the masterdesire of his life rendered unlovable by the forms in which it is clad there have been many murders and many pictures of remorse in novelsand none more powerful than the pages in which we were shown the wanderings of bill sykes and the slinking home of jonas chuzdewit after his bloody deed in the wood but mr dickens has exceeded even those in the scene where the wretched criminal tortured by the rebuking consciousness of his having failed in his diabolical design is dogged and dragged back to the fatal spot by his nideous confidant nothing can be mon masterly as a display of blank inevitable retri j bution and wretchedness redeeming touch  there is none about bradley headstone  even j the concealed love for him of the softhearted i prim little schoolmistress delicately indicated as it ia fails to furnish it to change the fancythe author of  pickwick never revelled among richer whimsies than are to be found in the comic parts of this talein the veneering household and the guests assembled by it the mistress of the man  sion and of the camels on the dinnertable with her readiness to weep her stupid sentimentalities about  bilby her inane admiration of the prancing gossip of that old mechanical harridan lady tippins because the same passes with her as a fashionable pearl of great pricethe portentous podsnap who knocks down argu  ment by british sentiments and laconic insolent dogmatismthe civil misty noblyconnected old twemlow who would be a true gentleman every inch of him were he not

they say on the stage boots and brewerare all new people in print whom every dinerout has met every  week of his life in private the vivacity and  variety of this division of the novel are admirable but when talking of dinners in our mutual friend we nuit not forget the most  incomparable dinner of all that of the newly  married couple bella and john at greenwich for the sake of the sentimental waiter the young man on liking so ignominiously thrust aside by the archpotentate in waiting who conceived that he had alone a right to the solemn monopoly of the secret of the day j we must stop  though touchesand traits rise  on us hythe hundred justifying what has been said that our mutual friend is one of mr dickenss richest and most carefullywrought books if we demur to wegg and to miss jenny wren as to a pair of eccentrics approaching that boundaryline of caricature towards which their creator is by fits tempted wecannot recall anything more real more cheering than the sketch of the milveysclergyman and clergymans wife lxth so unconscious in their selfsacrificing virtue and goodness yet the two so capitally discriminated by the extra touch of zeal and briskness and suspicion of the jews on the womans part it might be suggested that too much space is given to the impostorcouple the lammles and their designs on podsnaps poor foolish little daughter but again how capitally thrown in to the womans part is its scrap of shame and of remorseful feeling her figure ere she quits the scene unconsciously sketching on the tablecloth with her parasol is not to be forgotten as marked by that attitude and occupation enough then has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded and to prove that on its being read and read again every lover of types of human character every student of art in fiction every man who has  humour in his soul will find each and all enjoyment if as regards broad outline there are former stories by mr dickens which we preferif among his tales we rank the highest  david copperfield which includes so to say neither plot nor surpriseour mutual friend must be signalised for an accumulation of fine exact characteristic detail such as would suffice to set up in trade for life a score of the novelspinners wno give us situations without motives scenes without characters words without thoughts and the dialogue not of real life but of melodrama  the literary examiner our mutual friend by charles dickens with illus trations by marcus stone in two volumes chapman and hall latinised races accuse english writers of a disregard of unity in works of art and yet there is no great english work of imagination that does not recognise it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action we rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time and although we recognise even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot but a wellharmonized relation of all parts to one central thought ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based every great english work of imagination every good work of art all the world over is as it were a crystallisation of thought about some one central idea nowhere perhaps is the sense of this true unity so perfectly shown as in the literature of england in shakespeare grave or gay it is distinctly seen every turn of the light trifling in loves labours lost every character of the play blends with the rest in a poets graceful jest over the taste of his day for idle ornament in the plot nothing is done all the ingenious rhyming of the courtiers agrees with the state of don armado with the j brave outside who being called upon to strip to his shirt and fight owns that he has not a shirt to his back under all his bravery in the merchant of venice the play crystallises round the central thought of the relation between justice and mercy law and gospel in king lear earthly sovereignty breaks like a bubble on the wind as it flies through the stir of the grand forces of nature in julius casar the central thought is the problem of government the supreme sovereignty of caesar the philosophical republicanism of brutus the selfseeking republicanism of cassius and all other parts of the play show as it were the different faces of the crystal of which all parts have their harmonious relation to the single point of thought if we turn from shakespeare to fielding in tom jones broad as the canvas is on which that work is painted and crowded as it is with various incident there also we find every detail tending to ono centre the idea of the relation of man to society jones and biifil are types of the two opposite halves of the social world jones faulty but honest his faults open and incurring blame biifil keeping the faults of a worse nature secret giving a fair show to the worst acts and escaping blame in the relation of man with society open truth is contrasted with false seemiog and the episode of the old man of the hill is contrived to provide for the middle case of the man who cuts the knot of tiie social problem by avoiding conversation with his fellows mr dickens invariably fulfils in his novels this condition of deep seated unity which has been always recognised in english art all readers can feel that he does so and some readers who have paid little attention to good literature have raised thereupon arguments upon the propriety or impropriety of  writing with a purpose as tf any thing worth reading anything worth seeing anything worth hearing were ever produced or uttered without the purpose to express a distinct individual meaning of some sort there must be in every good novel play or poem one true thought for the mainspring that keeps all ita wheels in action and we must start from the mainspring if we would trace properly the movement of the works in this novel of our mutual friend the argument is of the soul of life smong the fictions of society we are shown in the first chapter lizzie hexam a truehearted girl in a position as degraded as imagination can conceive without stain to her inner purity she is bringing a pure heart to a revolting way of life ber father supports a wretched home among scum of the riverside by fishing for drowned men in this girl chiefly but not in her only we are as the story grows to see the radiance of the aoul of life we turn from her and the deep social degradation of her outward life at onoe in the second chapter to the other side of the books argument the fictions of society these are typified throughout by the friends collected round the dinnertable of the veneering the veneering themselves have their root in nothing being social jonahs

there is a great heap of money in the centre of the story made out of dust hy a dustman and treated as a dustheap in comparison with human truth and tender graces of the mind there is a bella wilfer whose character at every period full of light and shade is shown also in process of developmentour literature does not contain a happier study of light girlish grace advancing with no loss of charms into a pure womanly earnestness bella when young believes that she is sordid she has come out of a mean home into the daily relish of what wealth can buy is guest and friend of mr and mrs boffin social nobodies who happen for a time to sit on the gold heap with homely honest hearts that love of gold can never spoil then the boffins join with bellas lover to whom really all the gold belongs in plot for the girls education and the fetching out of the true soul of life known to be in her boffin covers himself with gloryand much mystifies the reader of the novel by appearing in the character of a man spoilt by wealth and turned into a greedy miser everybody knows how the story runs and so we need not describe at length or quote any of its passages we would only show that in this central plot also of our mutual friend as in the outlying incidents connected with it the inner thought of the book ia still the same is of the soul of life greater than all the fictions of society to this design belongs the sharp contrasting of such characters as mr and mrs boffin and mr and mrs lammle the story of the strong heart of betty higden who showed qualities of heroism in avoidance of the workhouse  the weak intellect with malice and greedy cunning in fledgeby the weaker intellect with love and the tender spirit of selfsacrifice in sloppy how full of a quaint generous humour again is the sketch of the dolls dressmaker little miss wren with her broken back and feeble frame her precocious wit sharpened by trouble in which the spirit of childhood casts its golden threads across the dull woof of her life of care and whose kindliness is at times touched with a malice as of childish playfulness familiar with bitter years of trouble nobody who reads this book as a whole can fail to be struck with the ingenious arrangement and skilfnl conduct of the story bead piecemeal it was satisfactory only to those who had faith in their author the secret of mr boffins little plot is so well kept that while it was in action they who believed their old friend to be shown to them ss really spoilt by wealth believed unwillingly and sometimes may have rashly supposed that here the masters hand had lost its cunning in fact if we look back to those scenes in which mr boffin enacted the part of a miser we shall be surprised to see how skilfully and freely the novelist scattered what with the key to it all in our possession we see clearly enough to be indications of the true state of the case the wealth of wit poured over all the pages of this book would be an intellectual harmons estate large enough to set on horseback every wegg of a literary gentleman with a wooden head we may say if we will that here we like and there we dont like any character or passage but far above desire to criticise by the small way of personal comparison between our individual tastes and opinions and those bf our author is the keen enjoyment of bis genius and after all there is the strictest justice in the heartiest appreciation of a liveliness of fancy that spends all its gaiety in quickening the honest sympathies of life of a pathos that derives ita strength from a firm hold on the realities of life a perception of character that seizes accurately types of men presents vividly their distinctive characters and all tinged with the observers humour that is to say with his own

B2674,['8949326'],  a diplomatists wife in many lands 2 vols by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson  co animated and rather indiscreet these reminiscences should secure a wide public more especially as beneath their sparkle there lies much sound reflection mrs hugh fraser who is the daughter of a wellknown american sculptor a sister of the accomplished novelist marion crawford and the wife of an english diplomatist has enjoyed an unusual upbringing during a girlhood spent in italy she acquired an intimate acquaintance with society as it existed before the achievement of political unity and she remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order her arguments do not always carry persuasion but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion it had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority thus gregory xvi displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green turkish trousers whatever the rest of their costume might be and by swaddling the figures on the tomb of paul iii in casttin draperies painted to match the colour of the marble  officials if prince massimo can be taken as a type were not overscrupulous  he was for many years postmastergeneral and utilised hh facilities to make a valuable collection america was a long way off frcm rome at that time  and every letter that my people received from the united states had had the ste mps boldly cut out of the envelope before it was handed over to the postman we get a pretty picture of priestly discipline in the alban hills  the great preoccupation in the castelli as the mountain villages are called is to keep the girls out of harms way i have heard the preacher say to the women 4 never mind about the men they were mado of different stuff to you  they can be sometimes bad and sometimes good but you cannot a woman must be either an angel or a devil there is no place between for her  the good priest therefore used to make them work in the fields in twos and threes and he would count them at the entrance of the town when they returned to see that no girl was loitering alone mrs fraser does not pay compliments to those whom others would call the liberators of italyvictor emmanuel for instance farini and garibaldi but we do not understand why a mystery should be mode of  garibaldis englishman his name was john whitehead peard he was a member of a wellknown west country family and he died in 1880 mrs fraser is definite however about that staunch champion of the temporal power cardinal antonelli whom she draws with vigorous strokes  44 in appearance he was a typical south italian small in build darkskinned with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell nothing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them his face wes meant to be mobile but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour he was a rapidly fluent talker and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us the italian chapters in this book are on the whole the most interesting but mrs fraser seems to have a happy knack of making amusing acquaintances wherever she goes she sits opposite a benevolent old gentleman at an hotel dinner and he reveals himself as edward lear the author of the book of nonsense a firm believer in ghosts she has collected some gruesome stories about them  and it appears that julius hare so excelled as a narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away in the second volume we are trans ported to peking and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two dowager empresses of whom the first died during the boxer rebellion whereupon the second who had been trained for the purpose promptly took her place mrs frasers argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than fortyfive or fifty and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate be that as it may she illustrates the pride of the chinese by a significant story  after the looting of the palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the imperial family through the chinese ambassador take them away exclaimed the minister they are desecrated filthywe never want to see them again mrs fraser concludes with vienna from 1880 to 1882 she does not spare the court and some of her stories about the empress are a little unkind she writes of the unfortunate however in a chivalrous spirit notably of benedek the defeated at sadowa whom she considers to have been the victim of

shakspearesorucig of the very thing which more than anything else makes shakespeare the greatest of dramatic poets it is not nierely tat dickens is himself a poet and in nothing so much as in his exquisite sensitiveness to those fine treads of analogy which conllect thle anliminate with the inanimate world so that the still life of his scenes is constauitly mnade to reflect the loiinant

dickens has acted phrases to the language which are to be found in almost alny column of a newspaper you may take up to read haphazardit is not simply on these accounts that dickens shows some a nity

confess to some disappointment at the explanation towards the close of the book of the mystery connected with mrs clennam and dte old house with its strange noises it is deficient in clearness and doe not fulfil the expectations of the reader which have been wound up to a high pitch indeed the woof of the entire story does not hold together with sufficient closenessa fault perhaps inseparable from the mode of publics tion the writing however shows all mr dickenss singular union of close observation arad rich fancy a few instances suggest themselves as e wurite of jeremiah flintwinch whose head is always on one side so that the knotted ends of his cravat dangle under one ear and who has a swollen and suffused look we arc told that he had a weird appearance of having hanged himself at one time or other and of having gone about ever since halter and all exactly as some timely hand had cut him down the watch worn by the same old man was deposited in a deep pocket  and had a tarnished copper key moored aibove it to hotw where it was mxk the garret bedroom of the old house contains a lean set of fire irons like the skeeton of a set deceased nnd  a bedstead with four bare atomio of poser each terminating in a spike as if for the diunal accovrodatiox of ogm who htiyit prejer to ilrnale themselves very poetical also is the identfiation of the pentup fire in airs clennams sickroom with the invalid herself  the fire shone sullenl all day and sullenly all night on rare occasions it flashed up pasionately as she dlid  but for the most part it was suppred like her and preyed upon itself evenly and slowly the light of this fire throws the shadows of airs clennam old flintwinch and his wife mistress affiery on a gateway opposite like figures from a magic lantern i as the roomridden invalid settled for the night these would gradually disappear mistress afferys magnified shadow always flitting about last until it fully glided away into the air as though she were off upon a withexcursoe lthenr the solitary light would burn unebangingly until it burned paebeor the dawn and at last died unider the breati of mistress afery as her shadow descended on it from the witchregion of sleep bhis is true poetry but there are a thousand such touches in the book as in all mr dickesas books which ever reader of cultivated pelceptions will perceive for himself in little

chapman and hall the atlielings or tfie three gifts by margaret oliphant 3 vols blackwood tte professor by currer bell 2 vols smith and elder the completion of a periodical by charles dickens has usually been regarded with sensations similar to those with which we witness the last glass poured from a bottle of good claret or contemplate the preparations for breaking up a pleasant family circle in the novel we have it is true one compensation which does not occur in the other cases against the annoyance of parting with our friend we have to set the gratification of our curiosity revelling in the solution of some mystery which has tantalised it at intervals during the space of twenty months the familiar green cover no longer makes its appearance to be snatched at and eagerly read while the other serials and magazines lie neglected and uncut but on the other hand we know all about itwe are informed of the relationships legitimate or illegitimate of the dramatis personalwe have the satisfaction of feeling that the proper people are made happy and that the murderer is detected and exposed when we say that the above sentences which describe with sufficient fidelity the reception which mr dickenss novels have usually met with are in no respect applicable to the case of  little dorrit we believe we are only giving a voice to the dissatisfaction which the story even very soon after its commencement began to excite and which has been brought to a head hy its extremely lame and impotent conclusion in a preface which he vainly strives to divest of the air of an apology mr dickens assures us that he has more readers than ever we are far from doubting the assertion  we can only say that it proves very little if any thing at all the number of novelreaders increases so largely every year that a great many inferior writers could make a similar boast the material questions to ask are does mr dickens keep his plat e in comparison with other novelists are all his old subscribers faithful to him  is his present public an addition to or in part a substitution for his former onol unless these questions can be auswered in the affirmative we submit that the mere fact of an increased sale is no proof of real and enduring popularity  least of nil of such a popularity as a man of mr dickenss genius ought if he does himself justice to demand and receive at our hands mr dickens and his critics will respectively  speak as they find we can only say that in a tolerably large and very miscellaneous acquaintance we have found that the greater number of persons have either left off reading little dorrit after two or three numbers or if they have persevered to the end have in the end unanimously condemned it we will hs briefly as possible indicate the grounds on which we are for the most part inclined to agree with them that mr dickenss genius is wholly comic and that his proper line is to speak roundly rather that of the buffoon than of the tragedian a view frequently held and set forth with remarkable ability in a recent number of blackwoodis a proposition we are disposed wholly to deny those who would affirm it consider pickwick his greatest work and every other of his tales inferior in proportion as it recedes from the pickwickian standard according to such critics mr dickens was bound to  draw all the stableyards in london for comic ostlers and all the suburbs for humorous retired linendrapers and plethoric coachmen before presuming to strike out a new line and attempt to excite other emotions than those of laughter he was to be ant democritus aut nullvs these persons do not reflect that such a law if applied to other artists who have done well would have deprived the world of all the novels of scott and half the poetry of byron and goethe eschylus might have been told to stick to his ships and not attempt to exhibit the persians ns well as conquer them if a man can make us laugh the probability is that he can make us ciy  indeed it is not unlikely  though wit may flash from fluent lips and mirth distract the breast that he cries himself much oftener than his friends imagine not to pursuethistheme beyond reasonable limits we hold that mr dickens was not only perfectly right to attempt something of an extrapickwickian nature but that moreover he has succeeded in producing it he has not only excited laughter but teais and shuddering far from having retrograded because he ceased to confine himself to exhibiting the salient points of exceptional characters the peculiarities of speech and gesture and the rich absurdities which so often pass before us and are forgotten he made decided and valuable steps as an artist and a describer of life in bringing before us the pathos of the old curiosity shop the powerful and thrilling description which raises martin chvzzleunt above every similar chronicle of murder and in sounding the deep moral abyss of meditated crime which in bleak house opens before the recoiling eyes of lady dedlock to have adequately grasped and embodied in fiction not the oddities which arc peculiar to each but the emotions which are common to all and while generalising the latter sufficiently to excite wide sympathy to have individualised them so as to accord with the idiosyncrasy of the characters by whom they were respectively manifestedis not a retrogression but an advance and one which lifts the author who makes it out of the comparatively low rank of comic writers and sets him in the same category at however great an interval as homer scott and shakspeare and to  expostulate  with him for wiping the paint from his face and scold him for aspiring to the high moral elevations on which he has so successfully tried his powers is as sensible as to expect a coquette not to exercise her powers of fascination or a soldier to box with his fists when he is armed with a revolver coincidently however with the exhibition of the remarkable creations to which we have adverted mr dickens has developed two characteristics which go far to neutralise the admiration which such great merits are calculated to excite in the first place the comic veiu which flowed so abundantly in pickwick has in later works run with a weaker and a drier stream like the sherry in leechs caricature it has be come a udder and a thinner wineby the addition of much water and some other very unpleasant ingredients his comic characters have become more and more exceptional and iu some cases the emotion they create is simply that of disgust they have every year less resemblance to human nature and the amusement if any which they excite is by degrees more dependent upon some quaintness of manner or speech which might serve once or twice but is reiterated ad nauseam whenever they make their appearance and less upon that display of the inward nature which properly constitutes humour place oue of these hideous beiugs by the side of an earlier charaoter and the contrast will be like that of passing from a stall at the haymarket when buokstone is playing to the grating of a cell in bedlam imagine the family of the smallweeds introduced to the genial society of sam weller or even of the bath footman  they would have been kicked out instantly and as for mr weller senior he would havesat upon them these wretched creaturesand they are not the only instance in mr dickenss later writingsexemplify another fault which seems io be growing upon himthat of choosing to describe people who are not so properly comic as fantastic and as frequently remarkable for physical infirmity as for mental absurdity where is the fun of laughing at a dwarf au idiot or a paralytic  or what purpose can be served by the exhibition iu the same novel of the hideous beast who slowly soddens himself with strong drink and the nauseous chemical components of whose person stream down through the floor to regale his fellowlodgers after his spontaneous combustion  whether the promotion of good feeling between the different classes of societythe trump card of mr dickenss schoolbe likely to be attained by his writings is another very doubtful point if he has succeeded in showing the upper class that there is a great deal of good in the lower he has certainly shown the lower that there is a great deal of bad in the one above them all his allusions to the higher ranks of society are distinguished by a spirit not of satire but of illnatured sarcasm which seems to be roused quite as much by mere differences of habits and manners as by any deficiency in respect of moral qualities formerly he laid his task on all alike and visited selfishness or cruelty with its due punishment in whatever quarter it might be fouud now he exclusively appeals to the gallery and tells them that all the virtues are to be found only south of the thames and west of tottenham court road extrema per illos justina excedeus terris vertigii fecit and has left to their deserved fate the regions of whitehall and belgravia utterly incapable of managing the business of the country which should be exclusively entrusted to the hands of the virtuous shopkeeper and the intelligent mechanic and this brings us to the second fault which we have mentioned as observable in his later works in saying that it is absurd to require that a novelist should restrict himself to the delineation of one special part of humanity we do not therefore imply that he is to rush blindly into a number of other subjects which are not in themselves pectiliarly appropriate to fiction and which besides are not to be understood by the light of nature alone now mr dickens being gifted with a keen observation ready sympathies an effective style and a good knowledge of certain limited sections of english life has on this slender stock of materials set up latterly as a social reformer there is in his works no evidence of any reading of the sort which is usually considered necessary for comprehending law politics or education and there is no method of instruction as at present practised on which he has not bestowed some very telling and malignant sneers nor does he seem to have paid much attention to business or to take much part in any of these matters except as connected with charitable objects in the promotion of which his bitterest enemy could not deny him to be meritoriously distinguished in spite however of these very obvious deficiencies he has come forward for the instruction of the public and his views have found very general acceptance with the class of persons who take their politics from punch and never open a serious book but are happy to raise their voices in any cry which their favourite novelist will suggest to them mr dickens is quite as destructive in his tendencies as mr carlyle but he is not quite so courageous the author of latterday pamphlets attacked the public offices when no one else thought of saying a word against them mr dickens prefers to kick an institution when it is down or at least when it is being taken down to be mended when some one else has scotched the snake he comes and sets his heel upon it but he is not the man to drag it out of its hole into the light of day enough however on this subject were we to pursue it further we should only be going over the objections which have been already set forth in our opinion with perfect justice by the saturday and edinburgh reviews and which mr dickenss sworn band of followers in the weekly press have been unable to controvert except either by the clumsy adulation which a man with mr dickenss sense of humour doubt less appreciates at its true value or by the same sort of swaggering impertinence by which they have tried to bully the public into posthumous admiration for their hero the late mr jerrold the chief objection which on our own part we have to make to little dorrit is that as a story it is insufferably dull and that it does not contain a single character whom we can love admire or respect the heroine herself who is evidently meant to be an embodiment of all that is charming and meritorious in woman has we regret to say failed to touch our feelings she seems merely a fresh version of esther summerson and from her perfections almost as remote from our sympathies as that very priggish character we tyre of hearing aristides called just and we would give the world for little dorrit to make a little mistake short of a faux pas or commit herself in some way so as to be brought down to the level of ordinary mortals so muoh moral sunshine is wearisome and as colton said of religion we would die for it fight for it spend for itanything but live with it and as has been acutely remarked by one of our contemporaries  her size is against hershe is made almost quaint in this instance  the virtuous marcia does not  tower above her sex aud the effect is detrimental to her her sister is almost preferable notwithstanding her coquetry it would have been only charitable to have given this young lady an opportunity of becoming something better but mr dickens with his passion for stereotypes gives her in marriage to one who is little better than an idiot and over the rest of her life draws a veil which no one who knows what this kind of marriage generally comes to will like to lift of the remaining characters mr dorrit himself is much the best his meanness in adversity and his contemptible insolence in prosperity are excellently described one of the best scenes in the b wk is the one where john chivery brings his offering of cigars to the old man who had been only too glad of such gifts in his marshalsea state of existence but with true snobbishness is now afraid of being compromised by communication with such a low fellow as  youug john to the whole account too of mr merdles career the highest praise may be given the account of his suicide and the state of the public mind upon the occasion is in mr dickenss most finished and telling style it is lucky that we have these characters aud scenes for it takes a good deal to compensate for the exhibition of such a grotesque absurdity as pancks whose perpetual steaming is one of the nuisances of the book and of such a hideous impossibility as mrs clennam we are it is true limier a certain disadvantage in criticising what this lady says and does because we do not very clearly understand the narrative which is meant to explain her conduct nor have we met with any one who does thucydides in his darkest moments was never more hopelessly obscure than mr dickens has contrived to be in the few pages where he professes to give the solution of the enigma on which we have been allowed to expend our ingenuity through so many previous numbers we have heard of the old gentlemau who taught his grandson draughts till his pupil beat him and we think that the author of the dead secret has set his master an example of neatness in the development of plot and of lucid explanation when there is no longer any necessity for concealment which the author of little dorrit would have done well to copy in the latter work we are distracted with a variety of threads which never seem to converge and tantalised so long with the mystery suggested in the outset that we overstay our appetite for it and it is then presented in such a form that to make head or tail of it must require a far severer exercise of the analytical faculty than most novelreaders will care to undertake like the champagne which mr albert smith carried with him to the summit of mont blanc it foams out in one unintelligible spirt delivered in far too startling and hysterical a fashion for any thing like enjoyment mr dickens has never been eminent for the judicious management of his plots having probably preferred to depend for success on brilliant execution and picturesqueness of characterisation he seems to have written this story from month to month and either never to have clearly conceived the development of it beforehand or if he formed a plan not to have cared to adhere to it this practice while it of course gives opportunities for working up any fire or railway accident that may occur in the interval is not particularly favourable to the unity and comprehensibility of a novel whether mr dickens has gained any thing by impressing into his service the fall of the houses in tottenham court road is a question which will easily be answered by any one who reads little dorrit a year or two hence when the dust of that frightful accident shall have finally cleared off for our own parts we do not see any moral lesson in killing off your villain in a fortuitous manner totally unconnected with any thing he has done or means to do ii real life the wicked often go on  flourishing like a green baytree poetical justice disposes of them in some way appropriate to their crimes and pursuits but to make use of a mere accident for this purpose is to miss both the truth of realism and the satisfaction of romance if mr dickens has not met with his wonted success in appealing to our feelings of pity and terror still less has he attained it by that exuberance of comic humours which has so often lightened the hearts and brightened the eyes of his readers what there is of comedy in little dorrit must we suppose be referred to the characters of flora mr rs aunt and the redoubtable mr pancks the latter is simply a bore who comes on the stage makes his accustomed grimace and disappears the aunt is in a certain way ridiculous but after all affords only the same kind of amusement that is produced by the vagaries of a drunken man flora is a weak reproduction of mrs nickleby without mrs nicklebys resemblance to nature even the names of the characters are hardly so happy as usual what facetiousness is there in calling a woman  mrs generala name simply unmeaning and absurd with not even probability to recommend it there is something too ia the sound of  clennam and  meagles which is positively nasty the london directory which has so often assisted mr dickens might surely have supplied him with something more appropriate than these in making the above remarks we are not unmindful of the fact that an author of established merit ought not even when he makes a slip to be visited with the castigation due to a mere pretender in literature but there are one or two points in little dorrit which go far to disentitle its author even to this allowance in the first place while some of the best and oldest blood in the country was being lavishly poured forth in the crimea he waa unpatriotic enough to hold up the enemy with whom england was at war as the model of all that england ought to imitate in the next place in the full face of the robson and redpath frauds of peculation and adulteration in almost every department of trade and commerce and in strange inconsistency with his portraiture of mr merdle he describes the middle and lower classes exclusively as the embodiment of all that is highminded and straightforward in business probably all associations are liable to the same faults of divided responsibility and official insolence if mr dickens has found that railway companies boards of directors and their underlings and other public bodies of a similar description are less obstructive and more courteous than the clerks at whitehall we can only say that he has been much more fortunate than the rest of mankind in criticising his present work we have of course judged him by the standard he has created and the taste he has formed little dorrit which might make an inferior man famous is very very far below the merit of what its author has almost uniformly taught us to expect from him in his present story the author of rockingham has produced a tale of less romantic interest than those by which he is already known  but he exhibits greater oommand over his materials more knowledge of his art and if possible greater fluency of style the plot is as follows sir charles rockingham a man of fortune and once of fashion has retired to his estate in the country in consequence of some disappointment as to which we are not particularly informed at the commencement of the story he receives a letter from a female relative proposing to make herself and her daughter miss lavinia dieaway his guests in order that the young lady may be diverted from an undesirable attachment which she has formed for her cousin lord walter dieaway the ladies arrive and the lovely young lavinia having gained sir charless sympathies by her gentleness and distress is beginning to become a little reconciled to her separation when her intimate friend lady camilla dareall arrives in company with lord walter and establishes herself in rockingham hall their host though subjected to a good deal of teasing by the lovers and their ally manages to hold his difficult position between miss lavinias mamma and the opposite prty with much success and there appears some hope that the marriage will be allowed to take place when it is suddenly broken off by the discovery of an intrigue in which lord walter has been engaged with a fashionable london demirep lady camilla and the faithless lover immediately depart for london and the  dark  beauty is left to be consoled by sir charles whether he succeeds in this laudable attempt or whether the truant admirer is recalled and the  fair camilla installed as mistress of rockingham hall are matters involved in considerable doubt at this stage of the story and we shall consult the readers chance of being interested by leaving them unexplained assuring him that the uncertainty is very ably kept up till the exigencies of the closing third volume oblige it to be resolved in a manner highly agreeable to all parties concerned the author of this novel has ventured on the difficult task of depicting fashionable people of the present day in their everyday habits and conversation and though the machinery he has adopted for this purpose demands a good deal of faith at the outset he must be said to have achieved a signal success he has described the sayings and doings of persons belonging to a tyj of which hundreds may be met with every day in the season in a manner which sustains the readers expectation from beginning to end on what seems a very slender stock of materials aud keeps him amused by a stream of persiflage which is always smart without lieiug positively witty and is lively and piquant without ever approaching the confines of vulgarity to take four persons one a clever highminded and amiable gentleman one a beautiful and affectionate girl but not possessing much character one a fast young lady of the  kate coventry order  one a cool vain stupid goodhumoured and impenetrable man of fashion whose chief characteristic is an inability to jonounce the letter r and whose chief idea is his  dwag and to make them talk through the greater part of three volumes so as not to bore or annoy a reader but on the contrary to excite his curiosity and arouse his interest is a great effort and one which even men of more genius than the author of rockingham would find it hard to accomplish dark and fair is in fact a genteel comedy with connecting elucidations in which the business that occurs between the nets is agreeably told the actors are sot described but made to exhibit themselves by what they say in a manner which is less common than it ought to be  and the peculiarity of lord walters pronunciation is so managed as to have a surpassingly ludicrous effect the bachelor who enjoys the perusal of this amusing book over his evening cigar will doubtless lose his heart to one or other of its heroines and be apt to think that a drawingroom in which either vinny or  cammy should be the presiding spirit might be a more desirable nest than even the luxurious smokingroom of his club barcliester towersthis book is a continuation of tm warden but it far surpasses its predecessor iu all the qualities which contribute to the goodness of a novel the warden was the work of a man with much sense of humour and a good deal of observation but it resembled too strongly certain polemical stories which were fashionable a few years ago and presented too wild a species of interest in the development of its narrative to meet with the appreciation to which its merits would otherwise have entitled it barcheskr towers is not liable to either of these objections and the only drawback likely to affect its general popularity is the iaat that it is a continuation of another less meritorious story mr trollope is no longer polemical except to a certain degree in favour of what is sometimes called the  highanddry school of church orthodoxy in other respects he wields a free lance and exposes the absurdities and shortcomings both of tractarian and evangelical divines with a wonderful and almost wicked impartiality the elements of interest in his present tale are more of the stamp usual in novels than was the case with thc warden  mr harding is less prominent and love and matrimony in the person of the charming mrs bold widow resume the supremacy which they are entitled to expect at the novelists hands the story is still concerned with the wardenship of the hospital but the question of the appointment is complicated with that of another post for which there is an equally strong competitionthat of husband to the fair eleanor bold one suitor is the chaplain to the new bishop of barchester mr slope a succulent evangelical parson something like a young vicar of wrexhill whose object it is to obtain the wardenship for mr harding in order to ingratiate himself with his daughter mr slope would have the appointment in his own hands but the bishop dr proud ie is henpecked and the appointment of warden ls the battlefield o which the superiority of mrs proudie or the chaplain is to be decided mrs proudies candidate is mr quiverful whose name expresses tl io conjugal fecundity which makes a post of  1500 ayear so desirable in the pursuit of eleaner bold however mr slope has two rivals first bertie stanhope the lazy clever cool impertinent italianized son of one of the canons of the cathedral whose family have spent most of their lives on the continent and are recalled into residence by the new bishop berties courtship is undertaken because he has tried various professions aud that of consort seems to be the only one left open to him he has not a bad chance in some respects for one of his sisters who is worldly and manoeuvring makes herself the friend of eleanor while the other who like so many charming women is separated from her husband and endowed with all the equivocal fascination which that position generally implies entangles mr slope in an unlawful flirtation and drives him as near to the verge of desperation as a low church clergyman can possibly go matters are in this state when a third admirer appears in the person of mr arabin a trained oxford divine who has been sent for by mr hardings friends to counteract the influence of mr slope were we dealing with any other novel we should be satisfied with having told the story thus far and take care not to forestall the readers interest by pursuing it to the end mr trollope however tells us in so many words that he has uo objection to his conclusion being divulged and himself in dicates long before the end of the third volume the fate of the characters about whom we are most interested he thus claims the high merit of being able to induce us to proceed by his mere manner of telling the story  and we are able to say that he has not claimed more than is his due his neat clear and vigorous style his sensible aphorisms and general brilliancy of execution are sufficient to draw a reader on although he knows that the lady is far too good for such a creature as mr slope to be allowed to carry off and is given pretty clearly to understand that mr arabin is at last to make a vacancy among the fellows of his college mr trollopes style frequently reminds us bf thackeray and his views of life are not unlike those which the great moralist is fond of inculcating they are healthy free from cant and with a leaning to the domestic and comfortable side of human existence not without the humorists smile at its romantic aspirations and its prosaic realities mr trollope takes any thing but an ordinary novelists view of life or he would have taken care not to make his heroine a widow it is not easy to feel enthusiasm about a widow however delightful certain individuals of the genus may sometimes prove colonel hamley has depicted a charming specimen in his lady lee but half the interest with which we contemplate her arises from one being told that her first marriage has not been one of affection eleanor bold however is described as having been sincerely attached to her first husband  and this fact coupled with her readiness to think of a second engagement so soon afterwards rather detraots from the freshness which one naturally expects to belong to the central figure of a story like barchester 2owers it will not be long we hope before mr trollope favours us with another story and then perhaps he will give the spinsters a turn mrs gores novel of the two aristocracies is a great improvement on the last work from her pen which we lately had the honour of criticising a lifes lessons though not otherwise than a clever story was in parts exceedingly dull a fault which certainly cannot be charged on the present story sparkling as it does with much of the ancient brilliancy which the writer of cecil showed she could employ at need agnoscimns vetens vestigia flamtnos whether this pyrotechny is employed for an equally legitimate purpose may be matter of more doubt the  two aristocracies  are of course those of birth and wealth and the tie which connects them is that of marriage mark barneson the son of an apothcary is employed as clerk by a great ironmaster whom he succeeds in business and one of whose daughters he marries the other is ambitious and marries a certain lord arden mark barnesons daughter at a later period inspires a mutual attaohment in another nobleman a younger son the greater part of the book is taken up in delineating the rapacity of lord arden as regards his wifes fortune and of the family of miss barnesons lover as regards hers the middle class and manufacturing interest being for the most part represented as distinguished by probity and disintereduess and the class to which lord arden belongs by the opposite qualities mrs gore seems to have been taking a leaf out of mr dickenss book but has outdone him in vituperation aud fallen short of him in truth for the imputation of official incapacity and offensive hauteur as applied to the aristocracy there is a foundation for that of trickery and double dealing in money matters we are persuaded there is none with thin exception and that of a country family whoso members are made scheming and disagreeable to an absurd and untruthful extent the personages are probable lifelike and well finished and though there is no hero the book is unquestionably very readable and amusing its faults in addition to what we have stated which are of course matters of opinionare that there is no one person at once amiable and clever enough to excite really strong interest in his fate and that at an important crisis in the story the dramatis personae are described as acting in a manner which we are morally convince is contrary to all probability take for instance the following dialogue say whether as regards the italicised portion the actors are not made mere puppets  i am not afraid rejoined the young lady looking him resolutely in the feice  into this house mr ferrier  the literary examiner little dorrit bv charles dickens bradbury and evans of all mr dickenss novels little dorrit is pernaps me one that takes the highest aim we are among those who read the first chapter eighteen months ago and the last chapter but yesterday during the publication of the tale in monthly numbers we have enjoyed it much and grumbled at it much it is complete aud what was dark is clear to us what matter was confused we find as many arrows loosed several ways fly to one mark in this novel mr dickens has thought more of his single volume than of his twenty parts resisting most completely the temptations which lead to the final hurt of many a book published in fragments little dorrit has been the less appreciated for this reason as fugitive reading but it will be only the more appreciated as a permanent addition to our libraries we do not hold it to be either mr dickenss best or his worst work but as we have said we believe it to be of all others as to its aim the highest and we may add also as to its manner of construction the one that is most characteristic of his genius its aim from which never a shaft diverges is to 6how the beautyeven the sublimityof a simple unaffected and unselfish doing of all duties great and little the ugliness and baseness of the qualities that are antagonist to this little dorrit is the subject of the novel and she means duty as in spenser una means truth or duessa falsehood the words do it begin and end possibly not by accident her very name her character the character of duty runs as a golden thread through the whole story the tale is dividedno scheme could be simplerinto two parts poverty and wealth through poverty and wealth the golden thread of duty runs ever the same little dorrit is tried by endurance of the lowest depths of want hopeless confinement in a debtors prison and is then submitted to the test of an abrupt change from want to wealth the golden thread runs on without a break without a bend little dorrit is then tried with gold and afterwards submitted to the test of an abrupt fall from wealth to poverty she mounts up to heaven she goes down again into the depths but her soul is not melted because of trouble the even line of duty never is turned to the right hand or to the left then again we have in little dorrits character the nature of dutythe forgetfulness of self the thoughtfulness for others the constant patience the noiseless endeavour to be straightforward and right in little as in great things and the habit of doing everything in the most kindly manner selfish relations do not weaken in her heart the filial tie she is laughed at patronised nominally held in low esteem but she wins more or less of love and reverence from all and in an hour of need even those who affect to laugh at her rely upon the wisdom of her counsels around the path of little dorrit whose life shows us how duty is done are grouped illustrations of the way in which it is left undone there is the circumlocution office specially bent on the solution of its problem how not to do lt there is mr merdle doing nothing in the world of commerce yet contriving to amass a fortunebut no stable fortuneby the fcfce of selfishness by pushing his way on rather than working it on totally regardless of all claims of duty there is mr casby doing no duty in life but subsisting blandly on a reputation for benevolence while he can get even extortion done on his behalf by a paid deputy there is mi ss wade doing no duty in life but tormenting herself with a selfish delusion by which she is made useless to society there is tattycoram needing the same wholesome lesson and receiving it at last in homely words of truth from mr meagles there is mrs c len nam wasting her years as a victim to that intense form of selfishness which gets from a misread bible justification of its evil passions and professes to leave duty undone in the name of god there is henry gowan a painter who gives no toil to his calling a man who has no purpose before bim who is not to be made happy by the fairest gift of fortune and upon whose married life there may well come the shadow of blandois of paris as little dorrit represents in the book the angel of duty so in blandois we have the demon ol selfish idleness his smile that is a sneer and his white bands that never have been applied to labour are the con stantly recurring emblems of his character in passages o persons description he is a gentleman for whom others must work to whom others must give way who regards none ss certainly as little dorrit regards all if little dorrit be the una he is the duessa of the tale we do not mean for a moment to assert that in writing this novel or sny other of his novels mr dickens bas proposed to himself to construct an allegory as complete in all details as that of sny book in spensers faerie queene upon that principle no novel of modern life could possibly be written but mr dickens as most readers have felt is st once poet and storyteller many of his paragraphs happen indeed to be really written in good verse though it is not in metre that their poetry consists it was not metre that made a poem of the tale of the old curiosity shop or of that portion of dombey and son which told the life and death of little paul from other english novelists we think that mr dickens may hereafter he distinguished as the one writing most habitually with the temper of a poet this it is in no slight degree which gives their peculiarity to nearly all the characters he paints they are personifications and as such their names pass constantly into our common speech as pleasant equivalents for the particular qualities they represent a particular form of hypocrisy in a man is expressed by calling him a pecksniff ora particular form of worthlessness in a statesman is expressed by calling him a barnacle of the sins of a class mrs gamp is an emblem  mr bumble is an emblem of another thing and mrmerdle of another in the same spirit a common abuse in statesmanship being seized and idealised is reproduced under the type of the circumlocution office every one of these personifications is to be taken rather as one of the elements of truth reduced to its pure state by the chemistry of genius than as the ordinary compound truth which enters into everyday life of course one may complain of a chemist who experiments on oxygen that it is air with the nitrogen improperly left out and so one may complain of mr dickenss sketch of the circumlocution office that it shows only half the constitution of the air in downing street in the same way too nearly all his characters may be pronounced monstrosities for nearly all the elements of which the world is made when seen alone can be seen only as monstrosities in nature we do not complain of the chemist for delighting us when be reduces to their essence a few compounds of dead matter nor need we complain of the poetor the novelist who chances to do poets workwhen he also reduces to their elements a few compounds of life in little dorrit we have the most perfect example of that principle of personification upon which consciously or unconsciously mr dickens generally constructs his characters and even his incidents and plots very often there is connected with each some typical circumstance such as the sneer and the white hands of blandois the pomposity and weakness of mr dorrits  hum  and  ha or the idea of a steam engine in reference to mr pancks who is a machine in mr casbys hands full of repressed energy by reason of the too much pressure he at last explodes in all personification this is a common and indeed a necessary and inevitable practice we are not sure also whether the same impulse which caused spenser to personify folly and vice under so many grotesque and monstrous forms is not that which has compelled mr dickens to create such dwarfs and dragons as a quilp a smallweed and a flintwincb we have called attention only to one point in discussing little dorrit the point from which we believe that a reader will best see the entire picture on the artists canvas and we are tempted now to illustrate a part of what we have been saying by reference to a point of similarity between two very different works mr dickenss little dorrit and the newcomes of mr thackeray when the story of the newcomes was appearing in its monthly parts very few readers could keep their attention fixed upon its purpose the author seemed almost to have no purpose and to be drifting about weakly with his characters there were not a few who gave up the reading of it in despair but the work being once collected and read as a whole proved to the surprise of many readers to be most remarkable for unity of plan  to be a novel in which mr thackeray bad taken the deepest and the truest views of life and in which he bad been working out with an unfaltering skill a single lesson its theme was marriage and in no chapter did the author lose sight of his purpose to contrast the right with the wrong foundations of domestic life that which had appeared like want of concentration in a detached part was found to belong intimatelyas words broken out of the middle of a sentence may belongto the simplicity and clearness of the whole the likeness between little dorrit and the newcomes in this one respect is obvious enough very lightly let us touch upon one other consideration we have said that little dorrit is to be regarded as the most characteristic of the works of mr dickens meaning thereby that it is the best example of the way in which his novels are constructed we need hardly remind any reader that it is characteristic also in a higher sense the spirit of the authors life is in his story what englishman does not know bow the fame won by the brilliant sport of genius in sketches by boz and pickwick filled ito authors heart not with a weak selfworship but with a deep sense of duty to be done from the moment when his name became a name to conquer with mr dickens has made only one use of its great influence as novelist as journalist in every honest way he bas steadily and day by day to the best of his knowledge and the utmoet of his talent been maintaining what is good attacking what is evil and bent wholly on the  doing of his duty i,biography
B2561,"['8535943', '6181610', '4453136', '4922775', '8765368']",  te literary exier the miu on ow floss by george eliot author ofi  scenes of clerical lifle and  adam bode in tlree volumes blackwood and sons it is worth while to inquire why one of the cleverest books of the day should be nearly the most tedious there is more evidence of the authors natural wit in the mill on the floes than there was in adam bede and a good natural wit is the first qualification of a storyteller it may be however that the cleverer book is at a disadvantage even in its cleverness ostendere not ostentare is an ancient warning the wit that shot up naturally in the former works of this writer and that was as pleasant in the  scenes from clerical life as in  adam bede having been lately shut up in a hothouse of too fervid praise is forced into excess of blossoming throughout the mill on the floss strain is evident it is an honourable strain to meet the utmost praise with the utmost deserving we know no example of a writer of genius forced into unnatural display of power who is more free than george eliot from all meanness of affectation overelaboration then may be one cause of the tediousness of the book charming sketches of childlife in former writings had received the commendation they deserved and so the first three hundred and sixty pages of the mill on the floss are spent on minute painting of a boy and girl the old praise is more than justified but the justification is attended by no small waste of the readers patience even as girl and boy maggie and tom weary us as they grow up they are made to weary us so much that by the time the story ends we are most grateful for the suddenness with whichwhen it is not to be supposed that one person remains who could bear to read about them any longerthey are both sent to the bottom of the floss the catastrophe though as a matter of art unsatisfactory precisely satisfies if we may generalise our own sense of relief the feeling of the reader let us say at once that we do not overlook the art with which by stray indications in the course of the book the end is foreshadowed that we duly appreciate the legend of ogg the son of beorl that we do know why maggie in her lovemaking is represented as having become clever at rowing and so forth we do not even complain of the suddenness and rapidity of the close although that may seem a fault by contrast with the long drag of the previous narrative we have no wish to urge the technical objection that the actual manner of the destruction of maggie and tom is impossible in nature obvious enough as the fact is that two floating bodies whatever their relative size being born on a current would be i born at the same rate so that the one floated in advance  if propelled even by the strength of a child must distance 1 the other the more serious fault of the catastrophe is part of the main fault of the book and we shall have to 1 discuss that presently it is the minor defect of excessive i elaboration that concerns us now i in no part of the work is this overelaboration so unsatis factory in its result as in the endeavour to maintain high credit for perception of the secret springs of character this credit we think was never fairly earned there is in the mil on the floes a very great profession of such insight for example when mr riley strongly recommends to mr tulliver the rev walter stelling as a tutor for his son tom having no very strong motives for doing so no less than five pages are occupied with a detailed analysis of the small reasons that may have worked together in his mind to affect the manner of that recommendation and all that is said in those five pages could have been better ex i pressed in a paragraph if not in one sentence it is indeed in this feature of the book only that there is room for the charge of a censurable affectation george eliot here appears as a quickwitted writer whose most laboured effort does not contain one possible character that is more than a sketchwho is clumsily wrong in every main feature of a story that is to be regarded as a copy from real life and who is cleverly wrong in a very great number of those ingenious remarks meant to express knowledge of life and character take for example the suggestion with regard to maggie of the  knowledge of the irreversible laws within and without her which governing the habits becomes morality and developing the feelings of submis son and dependence becomes religion the saying looks profound yet what could be more inadequate than to define religion the highest energy of life as a mere sbmision to irreversible laws surely such a writer if clever enough to be selfconscious can hardly claim to be considered an anatomist of human nature minute study of such artmanufacture as the dodsons might almost be compared to the deliberate handling of the scalpel over the ragcarcase of a fifth of november subject and tedious as the dodsons are how much exquisite humour has been pent on the elaboration of them  we only say that it is no anatomy of life at all it is a waste of lace and jewellery in the dressing up of scarecrows but thgeat saul at o r book a vw pet mwe at its td that w v ma have bow the intention of the writer it p en li s a n without a clue as r 1wa of amto iating great and shall ideas is rpoucd i a dilute form through half a dozen charaters for the of poorwitted provincial life is one of the plagues of the dodsons and beaks out even in bob jakin who is one of the least incomplete and impossible in th dory so the mechanic in another of mr dihkenss novels whose view of life was that  its aw a muddle has his axiom reproduced as if it were the one truth to be found by penetrating to the core of our humanity if the story of the mill on the floss has any central principle at all this passage from one of its clog chapts in which the italics are ours will express it the great problem of ihe bayinxg redit bdtwepenao axd duff is clear to no man who is capable of apprehedin it the question whether the moment has come in which a has lien below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy and must accept the sway of a passion against which he bad struggled as a trespass is one for which awves so matrboy tha4 wills all cam the casuists hase become a byword of reproach but their perverted spirit of minute discrimination as the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed the truth that moral judgments must remain false and hollow unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual lot to comment upon this passage is to comment on the tone of the whole book there is no  shifting relation between  passion and duty  whoever apprehends such a relation is below and not above the average of human wisdom in the words of one by whom we were taught the unity of truth and the simplicity of the divine law that can be applied as easily to conduct by the peasant as by the philosopher we have  a masterkey that will fit all cases it is not used to unlock the difficulties of life as they are untruly presented in this novel old tulliver dies worldly honest cherishing his hatred and his last words are said to be  this worlds  too many  honest man   puzzling    maggie the heroine for whose passionate life we are prepared from the beginning abandons a sentiment of love slow and long in its growth for a sudden passion of mere lust towards a man who displays only coarse animal love for herself and this under surrounding circumstances that are designed to aggravate the shame the author does not seem to perceive how despicable the heroine at last becomes and how little sympathy is to be won for her tortures and her doubts for her conflict of duty with passion that did once in the course of her life acquire the help of some ascetic teaching from thomas a rempis but that never attained to the application of the first principles of christian life which are the common ground possessed alike bay christian of every name a knot is tied by lustunless it be his account of the contents of bucklands  bridgewater treatise there is nothing else to account for maggies sudden love of stephenand the only solution of the difficulty is such shallow comment as the sentence we have quoted illustrates followed immediately by a letting loose of the floodgates to drown with maggie and tom all further consideration of the puzzle as it is with the book as a whole so it is with the characters presented in it the bible appears once or twice in the story as a thing to lay a hand upon and curse by there is one reverent allusion to the christian doctrine of tolerance in association with the doctrine of the story that provincial life is utterly intolerant as a social picture the tale may have been meant indeed to display the narrowness of life in country places but here also it is not true the scandal of a little town it needs no penetration to remark upon true depth of penetration would rather have been shown in pointing out how the warm human heart beats even in country towns as in the capital how mere an accident though a too obvious accident is that restriction and localization of talk which is here represented as the core of human life a narrow ugly grovelling existence among the people of st oggs truer and cleverer than this novel even as a picture of the outside littlenesses of provincial society infinitely truer in its recognition of the minds to which they are but as a dress was mrs giskells  cranford the merit of the mill on the floss as of george eliots former books lies mainly in shred feminine humour and a quick perception not of the depths and mysteries of life but of what is quaint and noteworthy in its externals to these qualities value is usually given by a wholesome unaffected style that will express truthfully the lights and shadows of the writers feeling an occasional defect in the style we are tempted to attribute to interpolation in speaking of adam bede we hinted a suspicion that it contained touches by a male as well as by a female hand we cannot easily believe that it is the graceful writer of the main part of the mdiu on the flos who describes young philip at the piano as an  amorphous bundle who speaks with cumbrous jest of a servantmaid scrubbing a table as  suffering a waste of tissue by evaporation compares  a shiny deposit of dust  on clothes to  tablets prepared for writing upon  speaks of wakems  parenthetic vindictiveness towards the uncomplimentary 1miller and of mr tullivers faculties  renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstra tion of the senses  ends a chapter with a

rodents with more of the same sort of dulness if it be not that another hand is answerable for passages amd phases em ad ee part of capte in the book that are as cape in dsey vatican wie mixed with

artificial men and womenas disjointed pieces of a puzzle to be wrongly put together and then swept off in despair  he mill on the floss novels and romances by george elliot blackwoodsthe authoress of  adam bede has been aptly compared to a dutch painter her writings belong essentially to the minute and truthful school of art and very often do not escape the accompanying drawback that for the sake of minuteness and truth grace refinement and even dramatic effect are ruthlessly sacrificed the result is that the characters painted with such wonderful accuracy are disgustingly coarse and what is worse in an artistic scene the incidents described with so much painstaking veresimilitude are trivial and uninteresting to a lamentable degree this fault dimly perceptible even in  adam bede has become unpleasantly conspicuous in the mill on the floss the characters are drawn with the microscopic accuracy of a photograph but when we have got them there is nothing either in themselves or in what they do which can excite any serious sympathy in their peculiar traits and personal fortunes the scene of the story is laid in the vicinity of some tenth rate town of semiagricultural semicommercial character through which passes the flosswhich the reader discovers somewhat to his surprise to be a tidal river rather prone to inundation all the personages of the tale belong to the lower station of the middle or the upper station of the lower class they are millers small farmers or engaged in retail business the constituents in short of that numerous section of the industrious community among whom fifty years since a sort of rugged honesty constituted the chief virtue but whose coarse grain has by the recent spread of education become overlaid with a thin veneer of refinement to this class the tulliver and dodson families who supply nearly the whole series of dramatis persona to the novel intrinsically belong the peer tulliver is the centre figure of the book and his wife whose constant boast it is to  have been a dodson brings the story into contact with numerous scions of that strongly marked but highly commonplace family the tullivers at the outset own the  mill on the floss and are well to do in the world but during the course of the tale lose their property and sink into sad destitution through the too eager prosecution of a lawsuit by mr tulliver the worthy pair have two children tom and maggie the former inheriting the practical tastes and also the obstinacy of his father the latter acquiring no one can tell how but certainly from no family source a truthful and somewhat romantic disposition accompanied by that  strong necessity for loving  which is the cause of so much happiness or misery as the case may be in actual life and constitutes one of the chief desiderata in the heroine of a novel through the first volume we have described the development of these characters in the boyandgirl stages described with wonderful truthfulness and rendered highly entertaining there is also a good deal about various members of the dodson family and the authoress shows her miraculous talent of eharacterpainting by the perfection in which individuality is stamped and preserved upon each of a rather numerous group although not one of them rise above the level of the most ordinary commonplace or possesses any more distinctive characteristics than those arising from the exhibition of small vanities and petty jealousies and microscopical grievances towards other scions of the dodson stock at the end of the volume a lawsuit  which has for years been the nightmare of the tulliver existence ends in an adverse verdict old tulliver is now ruined and sold up the mill on the floss passes to other owners its new proprietor being lawyer wakem his opponent at the trial and whom mr tulliver regards professionally and personally as an agent of the evil one and declared enemy not only of himself specially but of mankind in general the series of motives which induce the obstinate old man to remain as manager in the mill that once was his own is traced with admirable art and a true insight into the depths of the human mind is evinced when he is made to swear in the same breath and write on the flyleaf of his family bible his determination to serve his old enemy honestly and yet hate him eternally this vicissitude of fortune produces its natural effect upon the character and the career of tom and maggie but the story henceforth becomes highly distressing and we will not carry our analysis any further suffice it to say that while tom achieves some practical successes maggie gets into various difficulties and entanglements she turns ascetic under the erroneous impression that voluntary suffering is the source of happiness falls in love with the intellectual qualities of philip wakem the deformed son of their lawyer enemy and of old toms schoolfellow and with the personal qualities of stephen guest the son of an enriched manufacturer with whom the dodson family are somehow connected in vacillating between these rivals maggie contrives to bring misery upon both and involves in the misfortune her own cousin and friend lucy who has been almost engaged to stephen in the third volume a new set of characters are introduced the small gentry of the cathedral town of st oggs but by this time space has become valuable and it is necessary to hurry forward the incidents which led up to the final catastrophe this is brought about by a heavy flood on the flossthis river from the beginning being described as disagreeably prone to inundationin which maggie and tom are swept away together the conclusion is essentially melodramatic and so also is most of the  business to use a stage term by which it is introduced on the whole we are obliged to say that the authoress of  adam bede  has in her present novel not made a step in advance admirable in parts the  mill on the floss  is a failure on the whole in comparing the book before us with its predecessor we subject it no doubt to a severe test the sweepings and afterthoughts of a work like  adam bede might furnish forth more than one novel which mudie would patronize the public read and the oritics approve if written by any other author the gleaning of the grapes in ephraim may be better than the vintage of abiezer but the superiority

respect to his son are thus graphically giaen what i want is to give tom a good eddication sell be bread to him that was what i was thinking of when i gave notice for him to leave th academy at ladyday i mean to put him to a downright good school at midsummer the two years at th academy od ha done well enough if id meant to make a miller and a farrier of him for hes had a fine tight more schooling nor ever i got all the leanin my father ever paid for was a bit o birch at one end and the alphabet at th other but i should like tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the tricks o these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish it ud be a help to me wi these lawsuits and arbitrations and things i wouldnt make a dowiright lawyer o the lad i should be sorry lor himl to le araskill but a sort o engineer or a surveyor or an auctioneer and valyer like riley or one o them snar sd busineles as are all profits and no outlay only fur a big chain and a high stool theyre pretty nigh all one and theyre riot far off beih even wi the law i believe for riley looks lawyer wakem i the face as hard as one cat looks another hes nonie frighted dt him mrs tulliver has not the same ambitious view s as hcr husband for the boy she thinks more of the commissariat part of the establishment and has her doubts about  the washing and mending a iis clothes these indistinct doubts lead to tie suggestion on her part of all educational prgceedings being being restricted to the limits of the carriers cart mrs tullwer is in excellent sort of person but not uncomfortably troubled with intellect or intellectual aspirations but although her character on the whole is natural perhaps she is at times nade very absurd by having absurdities put into her mouth and here we would illustrating the remark by a specimen of the ladys conversation notice one very great defect in this writers dialogue for the sake of effect isle makes her characters say things they never would  syutter nonsense in fact which is meant to pas for fun ihe following has nothing droll in ir but is simply ridiculous she says after discussing the interesting matter of airing sheets well sir tulliver ive put the sheets out for the best bed and kezias got em hanging at the fire they arent the best sheets i should repent buying em only theyll do to lay us out in an if you wa x die to wlorrow mr tulliver theyre mangled beau tif an au ready as l a obo sitad b a pleasure to iay eg out an the t te r  the mig oak eiwn chest at thleabck  ae as i hoald trust anybody to look em out but myifl now all that is simply absurd pooeople dolt look on the solemnity of death with snob pti feelgs it is silly facetious dialoge s not the forte of the writer she makes mrs tulliver a buffoon and puts words into her mouth for the express purpose of being lahed at the pupose is transparent other authors d e e t do the same the poor people of 8ir walters novels are true to nature they ar not mad as surd the droll is a very different style only at taimed perhaps by dickens or anthony trollope now adays these are supremely droll in their lighter passages when writers of an inferior calibre try to be droll they become either noensical or vulgar but in contradistinction to the above solfioqy on the sheets we subjoin the following good description of the child maggie  you talk o cuteness mr tulliver sbe obervedl as she sat down 1but im sure the childs half an idiot in some things for if i send her uwtair to fetch anything she forgets what shes gone for a erhaps ull sit down on the foor in the sunshine an praft her hair an sing to herself like a bedlam catbr all the while im waiting for her downstairs maggie is apparently a  good for nought she hates dressing herself and brshing her hair and nenataess or tidiness of any kind but bhc loves tihe country atd the eountry fowen and readiiig too in quecr old books maggie is very fond of reading and half her time she spends wranlering along the banks of the millstream studying nattare and the other half in an old attic studyingr her books to which we shall refer present lv and also in another ocpation also for future consideration mrs tulliver is in despair about maggie she prophecies that she well never come to any good but will meet with some unexpected disaster in the way of drowning or other catastrophe she tried to impress maggie with a sense of her own unworthiress and advccates patchwork as a fitting means of useful occupation on one occasion when maggie has as usual been wvaiileiing on the banks of the millstream and has returned in a hopeless state of desbabille her mother delivers the foliowing admonitory letum  0 dear 0 dear maggie says krs tulliver  what are you thinking of to throw your botsnet down there take it upstairs theres a good gal an let your hair be brushed an put your other pinafore on an go on with your patchwork like a lady maggies answer is philosophical its foolish work sid maggie with a to of ht r mane  tearing things to pieces to sw em tgether again then as to aggies books to whie we have referred her library appeared to be nther extensive nor well chosen ldefoes histo of the devil being one of the collection and a very great fah vorite moreover she had banyans pilgrims progress too but she liked tk pictesbier than the lettepress of this latter work as to the letti r s its chief recommendation seems to have been that tberes a deal about the devil in it this uuamiable personage and maggie is a firm believer in his personality is her favourite study ill show you a picture of him blie says to mr riley one of her fathers friends ill show you the picture of him in his true shape as he appeared to christianthe body all black you knowtom bad coloured it in his holidaysand the eyes red like fire because hes all fire inside and it shines out at his eyes the philosophy of this writer has been highly and deservedly eulogisedi but she is not invariably correct the following is untrue she says plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivatice in order to compass a selfish end are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist that is the first mistake the world teems with selfish and deliberate plotting it may be of a very small and putty lind but there it is only wyben the plotting assumes a larger aspect is it recognised the craft of the monarch who by chicanery tries to annex a country to his crown is akin to the cunning of the farmer when lie seeks to hurt his iicighibour and add a few fields to his farm iloiok through the whole gradations of societj in every degree there is plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance and always of ccurse for a selfish motive enter into doniestic life either high or low there also in a diferent form will the selfish policy be found neitlher is the authoresss context to this assertion correct the reason on which she bases her argument is that  plotting covetousnef and deliberate contrivance demand too intense a mental action for many of our fellow parishioners to be guilty of them we dont agree to that cuinihig is the most contemptible of all trades because it is the easiest then as to the dramatic villain being the only one where this intense mental action is observable we can but say that the dramatic villain has always seemed a most transparent personage to us growing out of dothilnl and perhaps relapsing into the szune element again in the following passage too she is wroig it is easy enough to upoil the livesof our neighbours without taking so much trouble we can do it by lazy acquivscence and lazy onission by trivial 1ilsities fur which we hardly know a reason by small frauds neu trahistul by iwall extravagancits by maladroit flatteries and clumisily improvised insinuztios

wormeaten shelves and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs and here sihe kept a fetish which she punished for all her inisfortunel this was the trunk of a large wooden doll which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reldest of cheeks but was now entirely defaced by a long caree of vicarious suffering three ziils driven into the head comminemorated as many crises in maggies idne years of earthly struggle that luxury of vengeance having leen suggested to her by the picture of jatl destroying sisera in the old bible the last nail bad been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual for the fetish on that occasion represented autit glegg but immediately afterwards maggie had rejfected that if she drove so many nails in she woud not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall nor to comfort 4t and make believe to poultice it when her fury was abated for even aunt glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much and thoroughly humiliated so as to beg her nieces pardon since thein she had driven no more nails in but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating her wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made the square pillars supporting the roof lte character of mjaggic is beautifully drawn from beginning to end although some of the in cidents which are related of her are too abruptly told and arc scarcely within the range of proba bility  her flight to the gipsies for instance an episode of neither point nor purpose introduced fur no special reason and containing no

remarks for instance on an acute sorrow are truthful and exchilctit there is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first shocks of trouble just as an acute pain is often a timnulus and produces an excitenent which is transient strength it is in the slow keen life that follows in the time when sorrow has become stale and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its pain  in the time when day follows day in dull unexpectant saneness and trial is a dreary routine it is then that despair threatens it is then that the 1esrcmlhtorv himv r of the soul

praising this book will feel inclined to begin by comparing it with adam ofede when an author has made a standrd of excellenc for himself everything that be writes subsequently is naturally referred to that standard even though he may bave laboured to open fresh ground and to develop a talent entirely news  the mill on the floss however tog distinct enough in its characters and its story from the preceding novel is yet so lik it general tone of thouglt and in the picturs life which it represents that cornasw a fair tureen the two books becomes in this means of criticism in the mill on the floss then we have a more complex book than  adam bede there are many more personages each of them individualised without exaggeration there are crosspurposes and conflicting motives and passions to a far greater degree than in the other simple drama the time through which the chronicles extend is longer the chief actors are presented to us not fully formed but as children whose temperaments we are to see modified by circumstances whose characters wve are to see gradually unfolded and perfected much more artistic labour has been bestowed on this book than on adam bede the workingout of maggie from the child hungty for love to the woman who triumphs in her selfrenunciation at the most difficult moment was surely a greater mental toil than the conception of lietty with her immobile animal nature and her unchangeable selfishlness he four dodsonsisters each distinct all unmistakably of the 1odson family were surely not so easily conceived and sustained as the one mrs poyser we tind snore artistic labouir here and unfailing success but on the other hand we feel that with all this greater comparative cleverness the hook does not enthral us as  adam bede lid he seal of omnipotent genius though present and to le found 1y those who seek for it does not manifest itself to readers of all kinds and classes so readily compelling instant acknowledgment and homage maggie notwithstandirig her lifelike development from child to womnau and the varying lights of passion and of ill under which she is exhibited to us never gains that objective existence which letty possessednever quite frees herself from the leadingstrings which george eliot holds in his plastic hand not one of the dodsonsisters however distinct they be from each other attains to the tangible humanity of mrs poyser   tie book resolves itself into the history of a brother and sistertom and maggie tullivert the scenes between the two children at iorli coat mill the quarrels over jam puffs and reconciliations over plumcake the domineerings of ion and the submissive but exigent love of maggie will come home to the heart of everyone who can remember having once been a child with a childbrother or sister rrhe dispositions of the two children are very different tom is mnatteroffact full of commonsense anld quliet determination he has a strong and clear apprehension of justice but the to dicnion with him as with so many people is simply what he sees to be just and right as regarls the conduct of others lie constitutes himself the judge and suffers tio appeal against his judgment conscious of his own strong will and rectitude of purpose he has no suspicion that he is incapable of fathoming the tendencies and motives of others and of weighing their actions in impartial scales he takes his place as judge by right he never doubts his prerogative he never site in judgement on himself or balances the shortcomings of others against shortcomings of his own within the narrow range of his circle of sight he sees very acutely and distinctly and performs the duties which lie manifestly therein with a power and virtue that cannot be surpassed but he brings all with whom he has to deal within these narrow limits and arraigns them there being unable to conceive of any regions beyond maggie on the contrary has the wide vision which finds itself bounded only by those clouds of mystery that hang about the horizon of this mortal life she is always reaching out towards that far distance for something better and greater and more true than she can grasp in the actualities immediately around her she craves with an unsatisfied hunger for appreciation for admiration for love she searches vainly in the hearts of her kindred for exquisite sympathies which have no place there she feels herself imprisoned and fettered by the sordid circumstances which encompass her ann longs for unattainable delights of beautiful sounds and sights and thoughts she has none of oms clear logical perception of near things in her interpretation of them she is alnost always wrong she is al most alwvays doing rvhat she should not and discovering her error when it is too late and repenting with bitterest imagining of what might have been and what will be she is dreaming when she should be acting she forgets to feed toms rabbits and lets them starve to death while for every insect that she neets she invents some story investing it with human feelings and attributes facts are less real to her than her own fancies a quaint picture or a fragment of a book such as the examples in the latin grammar suggests more to her than the everyday sights and incidents of common existence he misfortunes of the family which introduce om to that life of strenuous exertion for which lie is especially fitted by nature sadden the position of poor maggie yet more her hopes her intense longings for ap preciation and for outward enjoyments congruous with her keen sense of beauty die away after much miserable wrestling with her fate she arrives at that stage of selfrenunciation where starved natures so often find a refuge then philip wakem reappears upon the scene and maggie is roused from her torpor to enjoy some months of happiness ending in worse misery poor maggie is never in conformity with the circumstances in which she is placed that which should be the longwishedfor blesssing always turns out the direst curse she has not that happy limitation of perception that tom has and is continually directing her conduct according to the feelings and the will of others her father and brother hate philip wakem and philip wakem loves her while still further complexity she does not love philip wakem then again in the case of stephen guest the conflicting interests are yet more irreconcilable her fate is always at war with maggie tulliver out of her trials and weaknesses however she gathers a majesty of strength in comparison with which toms sober rectitude sinks into insignificance her sense of justice unfolds itself into the very opposite of that which rules her brother seeking its sanctions not in herself but in those for whom she has to renounce herself   e  in the contrast of the characters of this brother and sister consists the main idea of the book that both are admirably conceived and consummated no one will deny tom is the more artistic creation though he is much less interesting than maggie in any other hands but in those of george eliot tom would have be come a cruel selfish monster or a man of highest wisdom no author is so impartial as george eliot he plants the failings and the virtues of his characters with equal freedom from prejudice with equal tenderness he never contrasts the good qualities of a person with the bad for the purpose of antithetical etlect but makes good and bad run into each other and intermix as a watercolour artist blends his colours on the paper there are no rigid outlines in nature no harsh crude oppositions of light and dark or of primaries and their complemnentaries but infinite gradations of shade and harmonies of colour this george eliot sees in its full significance he never forgets that vices are but virtues in excess or defect and that the extremes while they are negations of each other are nevertheless connected by an indivisible bond he never forgets that practically these absolute extremes are to be found nowhere in human nature any more than the absolute mean of which if we were capable we should cease to be men and should become divine    this tom tulliver is e to use a bad word the most objective character in the  mill on the floss thus coming iato comparison with the hetty of adam bede the hard narrowness of torn is as foreign to the temperament of the author ab hettys animalism if we begin to surmise how such characters are conceived we find the process to be one of denudation ihe creator of jetty has to throw aside the inoral and intellectual parts of his nature the creator of tom has to limit his sympathies within a prescribed circle of narrowest radius this denudation is a very different matter to that imaginative process which ordinary novelists use when they raise their personages from wonted middleclass life to the peerage or push back their smiths and joneses of today into the middleages the danger in drawing such i characters as rom and hetty is always lest thel denudation should be carried too far hettys might easily have become wholly ppetitive ad i thus have lost her humanity tom might easily have become a monster having no sympathies t whatever     in magie it seems to i us that we can trace a strong resemblance to i the janet of janets repentance if we a were sure that george eliots characters bad f their germ in reality as we firmly be i lieve all of them to have more or less i we should at once pronounce that the same 8i person sat for the portrait of both heroilues e mqaggie is exhibited under circumences very t different to those which surround janet ma and the tempeftnents of the two are distinct fi enough but the likeness is to our eyes striking if there be some unconscious person whom george eliot has taken as the first idea of janet or maggie probably her environmentsc are very different from those e of eiter still the resemblance between certan screpe of nthe ci mill on the floss and ofe  wanktsrepenthne cin is close as

average young man having i stronger passions perhaps than most young men would care to own to but then he is provincial in him as in the arthur of  adam m bede we may detect now that we flatter ourlselves that we know the secret of the author ship signs of the writers sex the love scenes between him and maggie are written with a pas sionate truth that well exhibits the other phase of george eliots power and contrasts marvellously with the dutch painting of the dodson class great care is taken to keep stephen guest out of the category of villainous tempters and seducers he is lamentably weak but not wicked aforethought the crisis of his running away with maggie arises from accidental farourablenes of circumstances not from design on his part or agreement on here there are no villains in these books of george lfliots we find in them no unpardonable sinners whom poetic justice dooms to an ill ending     the last scene in which tom and maggie after long estrangement meet upon the swollen river and die together fidy gives a sad ending to this sad story  j a  the mill on the floss by george eliot 3 vols blackwood  sons  the mill on thc floss will not we think obtain tne same acceptance as adam bede it is not that there are traces of exhaustion but the present work bears tokens of haste it lacks the fullness of a work written in calm leisure the echo of the old success has not had time to subside and the authoress seems to have been haunted by a spirit of emulation with her own shadowthe everpresent obligation of being equal to herself there is a pervading sense of hurried unrest and of ambitious striving to write not out of the heart but with a desire to reproduce the effect of mrs poysers sententious sayings and lisbeth bedes querulous maunderings the characters of the four sisters who had all been  dobsons and had a  way in their family are cleverly drawn but they verge on caricature and there is a great deal too much about them they are like favourite actors presuming on old favour to make their jokes and byplay too prominent the authoress shows skill in the way in which lier characters are made to reveal themselves by their own words and acts without any formal description beyond a few decisive and masterly touches there is power to unravel the contradictions of human feeling and insight into the tangled complications of human relationships and eloquence to utter what the heart has been subtle to conceive  but with all this and in spite of occasional vigorous scenes and delineations the sense of haste and unrest gives a coldness and crudeness which make the work like fine fruit plucked before it is ripe the heroine maggie is the best drawn character in the book it is subtly conceived and it is original worked out by the authoress with a skilful and loving hand tom trulliver her brother is an excel lent companion picture and thc two natures are well contrasted maggie is however though most elaborately worked out her imaginative passionate nature with its desires to do right and its touching failuresthe resolute heart the imperfect judgment  though treacherous sliding imaginative affectionsthe battle of life begun and carried on in thc vain trust in her own unassisted strengththe weariness with the greatness of the way which overwhelms her and her utter weakness against the illicit affection that creeps into her heart making her guilty of the cruellest wrong and treachery to her dearest friendthe misery brought on all connected with herthe feeble but constant struggle of her better natuic against the magnetic insidious influence of passionthe final blind desperate effort with which she breaks away and returns broken iu heart tarnished in good fame with the certainty of having made though irrevocable misery of all she loved bestwith her own misery greater than she could bear and a desolate life beforenothing saved from the wreck of her young life except the consciousness that she broke loose from her temptation and at the eleventh hour escaped back into the right way this is all worked out with a power and pathos that is very beautiful the love described is not of a nigh nature stephen guest whom she attracts from her cousin is a commonplace handsome young man  he yields to the attraction of a remarkablelooking young woman with scarcely a struggle the reader is bidden to accept it as a case of elective affinity  it is mere personal attraction a passionate inclination which swallows up honour duty humanity ties of kindred and friendship it is the essence of selfishness but the struggle is not the less fierce in maggie because it is ignoble nor is the temptation less because rt is base  and whatever the readers indignation may be or hissympathy with lucy the sweet generous forsaken maiden or with phillip the betrothed husband and devoted friend of maggie the whole episode is so skilfully wrought that all his other feelings will be merged in though milder grief of pity the history of mr trulliver and his sorrows and difficulties have an interest of their own and mrs trulliver his wife is another version of mrs nitkleby we have abstained from giving any outline of the story of the mill on the floss because we did not wish to forestall the readers interest and a mere outline would hardly give a fair notion of it if wc seem severe in our judgment it is because we judge though authoress by the standard of her own capability we do not consider  the mill on the flossequal to adam bede the authoress has not given herself fair play there is the old freedom of hand but though workmanship is neither so delicate nor so elaborate as in theclerical scenes and adam bedeneither is the story as a story at all comparable to adam bede for interest or for artistic treatment,biography

of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated departed spirits alas alas gaston de blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to the writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of

help the demon in his persecution of a royal favourite the old plea of magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt afforded by the spectre here was a dilemma for the authoress and she found no escpefor like the egyptians of old whatever ghost did was supposed imitable by man but the end

B3513,['8534275'],  the return of the native the return of the native by thomas hardy smith elder and co there are many indolent readers who when they open a novel like to plunge into a lively conversation or an exciting scene at once and lav down the book impatiently if their interest is not aroused on thc very first page to these mr hardys book will appear dull because they will not read far enough to be interested but persons of a more patient disposition will be well rewarded for thc task which we are compelled to admit is not quite an easy one of mastering the long descriptions of the groud bonthy furzy briary obsolete country in which the scenes of this story are laid wc j warn intending readers not to be alarmed at the verbose eccentricity which distinguishes its opening chapters nor to be repelled by the uncouth language often closely verging on coarseness in which the conversation of the natives of egdon heath is carried on the obvious imitations of victor hugo are confined to the opening chapters or at any rate reappear only at rare intervals throughout the work while the intimate acquaintance with and real affection for the suitoundings of his tale displayed by the author almost reconcile one to the repeated and prolonged emphasis with which he dwells on them the book is not crowded with characters as is too often the case in modern novels only three women mrs yeobright her niece thomasin and eustacia wye and three men wildeve young yeobright and the reddleman have anything to do with the development of the drama of course there are other characters but although some like christians are fresh well drawn and very amusing they play no part whatever and only serve to fill up the background the result of the skilful handling of these few persons is a concentration of interest steadily increasing tc wards the middle of the third volume after which unfortunately the sudden and unexpected removal of the two most interesting because most inexplicable actors leaves the stage blank and bare it is not usual for authors to kill off half their dramatis personce long before the book ends but from mr hardy we cannot expect anything usual on the contrary the originality and freshness of the work is such that these very qualities at first prevent our perceiving its full strength when after eleven months in london we first reach a remote alpine valley surrounded by weird rocks and cold glaciers the strangeness of our surroundings will for a few hours not allow us to enjoy their full beauty so it is with the  return of the native there is no heroine in it and nobody at all like anybody of whom we have read before nor is there as far as we can make out any hero one wedding takes place in the first volume another in the second and a third at the end of the book but the first two are not at all satisfactory and we suspect that no one will care much about the third the reddleman who acts throughout as the deus ex machind is apart from his redness which is inseparable from his business of selling dye the only character whom we think we have met before under the garb of a supernaturally intelligent amateur detective we do not propose spoiling the pleasure which attaches to the unknown and unexpected by betraying the plot but it may fairly be objected to the slender framework of the tale that if its conclusion had been pleasanter it would have lost none of its interest and would have been a great deal more satisfactory it appears to us that mr hardy had gradually become tired of working out the singular characters of eustacia and wildeve and not seeing how to get them out of the inevitable mess into which no unnatural events but their own innate weakness brought them had killed them off to get rid of the difficulty such an expedient if expedient it be is unworthy of the author and we are convinced that a little more patieuce would have been well bestowed on the third volume again clyni hardly betrays his tendencies with sufficient explicitness to permit us to feel that the course of life he at last adopts is quite natural notwithstanding our sympathy both with him and with his lofty aim we feel that he was made for something greater if not better and the interest the author arouses for thomasin is we believe much milder than he expected for it is evidently his wish that we should be satisfied with the quiet happiness she obtains while in reality we are perfectly indifferent to it eustacia is so obviously mr hardys favourite that she becomes ours also we are therefore disgusted with her misery in the second half of the novel and disappointed with her sad end notwithstanding these imperfections which are perhaps not faults but only idiosyncrasies of the author the book is one which deserves a better fate than merely to be skimmed and then thrown aside not only is it far very far above the ordinary three volume novel but and this is much higher praise many parts of it will bear reading a second time and will then be better appreciated than at the first hasty perusal the return of the native makes us expect very great things from mr hardy if he will only work slowly and patiently,biography
B2163,['8448312'],  the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to us we have seen the silken courtiers to whom these people are as dogs bound by no ties of love among themselves the marquis bas left the reception room of monseigneur devoting him to the devil he has run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always the same with you people he cannot pay something   he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you   alas no monseigneur  but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass well  monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass again well she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition

the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to the story of doctor manette as to the history of france here again is a little picture of saint antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other

B6862,"['6721267', '8736364']",  literature more leaves from the journal of a life in the highlands from 1862 to 1882 smith elder  co it is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be the twenty years with which the journal has to do was indeed an eventful period it was marked by such important incidents as thc francogerman and russoturkish wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves but with these matters the journal is altogether unconcerned it deals solely with the queens life in the highlands and though it is quite natural that her majestys subjects should wish to know what were the queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it it records no thrilling adventures a carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the journal offers to its readers the interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective we look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her as a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray though selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect an art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic and the special value of the queens journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour in these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects it is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the queen is so fond of scotland this book answers the question it is because there and especially in the highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity the queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of though house of stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors heredity asserts itself mr galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone for we arc insensibly reminded of king george iii farmer george when wo read the queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping but although the journal recounts the queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied but we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern the book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author charles j robinson  more leaves from the journal of a life in  0f the highlands from 1862 to 1882 btf literature  tn smith i crq elder  co   j th from a purely literary point of view there  he is not a great deal to say of the queens new j th hook its style is of the simplest and it al has the charm of naturalness which belongs  al to simplicity the story is told without effort  w or affectation of any kind and produces its j tc effect entirely by though force of sincerity her  q majesty is probably a sympathetic rather  s than an acute and dispassionate observer  a1 and everything that she sees is seen through  o sentiment that the sentiment itself is tl always pure and often elevated is a reason i why these records of home life in the royal c circle will find a responsive echo otherwise o the experiences recorded are not altogether 1 such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character t the book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen it affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare but it is e its simple human interest that gives the  hook its strongest appeal the reader rises  from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learned something more of the good  i woman by whom it was writtenthat above all else he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be born by all to whom it comes how will the queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of st pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the queens consort had died at windsor this book contains the answer to that question its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope of the queens personal character the volume contains naturally enough many indications that character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will it was so in those early days of her sovereignty when lord melbourne told the queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could eve happily i for long without a mans arintb rest on and when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero this womanly trait is obviously a key to the queens intimacy with dr norman macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered though tribute of an i abundant gratitude a keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that principal campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of though statue of the prince consort at aberdeen when it rained in torrents in other places the manifest sincerity saves everything the book contains some few indications of the queens taste in literature we gather that she is a warm lover of scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the duchess of saxecoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell scotts stories  to prince albert and his brother the  queen herself appears to be familiar with scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j we are told that brown gave her a copy of the poems of the ettrick shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things it is said in various places that lady churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books this is to be regretted though anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure a similar silence is observed with respect to the queens tastes in the arts wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte that her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence it is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is though sole business of the book to present but while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the queen must have thought and written frequently the following passage on a visit to abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to abbotsford the wellknown residence of sir walter scott it lies low and looks rather gloomy mr hope scott and lady victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present duke of norfolk with their children the young duke of norfolk and some other relations received us mr hope scott married first miss lockhart the last surviving grandchild of sir walter scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of sir walter they showed us the part of the house in which sir walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his ms of ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx sir walter had himself collected then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of sir walter in the study we saw his journal in which mr hope scott asked me to write my name which i felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others we went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are sir walters last clothes we ended by going into the diningrcom in which sir walter scott died where we took tea in this connexion it may be mentioned that when the queens uncle and early guardian leopold king of the belgians travelled in scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the princess charlotte he was for a few days the guest of sir walter scott at abbotsford while there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way an aged scotch divine alluded to the fact that though king was descended from frederick the wise elector of saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the reformation and to become a protector of martin luther thereupon leopold said that he felt more honoured by though mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay the relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the queen herself says in these  leaves of the strong protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of scotland her majesty s love of the highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment that she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough above all things the queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to carlyle goethe was the first to say  come let us make a description it will be remembered that the passages of the queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her majestys visits to poor highland women there was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to though queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman the present volume contains two such peep into highland life and the one we quote fresents us with though last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow grant on sunday august 22 1869 i went to see old mn grant whom i was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and i fear dying of dropsy on august 20 i again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way i took her hand and held it on the 27th she died on the 28th i stopped at her cottage and went in with louise and leopold we found all so clean and tidy but all so silent mrs gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death she had on the socks i gave her the day before yesterday she was in her eightyninth year probably the most enjoyable of these  leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the highlands here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep at a quarter to twelve i drove off with louise and leopold in the waggonette up to near the  bush the residence of william brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep this is a practice pursued all over the highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man james brown my shepherd though elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then william and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry to the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tyre and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough a very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping it was a very curious and picturesque sight more pathetic is the following  tuesday june ll 1872  brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time i was dreadfully shocked it was the child of a man named rattray who lives at cairnnacraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper abercrombies house not far from monaltrie farmhouse in the street at a little before five set off in the waggonette with beatrice and janie ely and drove along the north side of the river we stopped a little way beyond tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest they were searching everywhere while we were there the ol grandmother catenach by name who lives at souttar hole came running along in a great state of distress she is rattrays mother we drove on a little way and then turned round we heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at monaltrie burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below mrs pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the dee this burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen the little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the dee and carried along too dreadful  it seems from what i heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one we drove back and up to mrs grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  wednesday june 12  drove up to the bush to warn mrs william brown never to let dear little albert run about alone or near to the burn of though danger of which she was quite aware she said her husband william had started off early at three this morning some people went down to abergeldie and as far as the girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle no word of the poor child being found all were to start early to search that the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the queens domestic life in truth her majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment so long ago as the year of the queens accession the marquis of londonderry writing to the duke of buckingham said i hear melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection thia fact her premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience that these  leaves contain much moro about mr john brown than about lord beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise the book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers naturally enough brown became essential to the queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy it is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of browns robust independence and simple usefulness we do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship ,biography
B8377,['8771275'],  vassili verestchagin painter soldier tra teller autobiographical sketches 2 vols illustrated bentley  son mr f h peters has translated these sketches  from the german and the french a process which may partly account for the fragmentary character of two extremely readable and spirited volumes the sketches begin with the authors sixth year and conclude with reminiscences of the russoturkish war of 1877 madame yerestchagin occupies a large portion of the book with an accountwhich is most characteristic and cleverly written and by no means overcharged with admiration for the english  of her journey with her husband through india in the gentlemans narrative we have him as he sees himself while the lady supplies a picture which does not differ materially from her husbands portrait the artists love for colour and energetic motives which was manifest in the pictures he exhibited at the grosvenor gallery is displayed on every page travelling through central asia as an attache of general kaufmann m yerestchagin enjoyed peculiar privileges and he bears emphatic testimony to the decrease of slavery under the dominion of his countrymen not only in the territories they have annexed where slavery is forbidden and where the markets no longer exist but in the neighbouring states where the natives believe  not without reason that the russians may come any day and pay them a visit and mercilessly release the slaves as they always do wherever they go domestic castigation much affected by the natives is less rife than of yore the end of the world is coming cried our authors landlord with a gesture of despair  how so    why what else is one to expect when a husband may no longer correct his wife  if you beat her she threatens to go to the russians in fact the unpatriotic ladies appeal to caesar not often in vain they do not seem to be innocent of intrigues and gossipvices which according to the traveller are due to the degraded social state of creatures who are confined to merely animal functions and disfigured physically by the labour of a beast of burden in central asia the townswomen are worse off than in persia and turkey but the nomads are freer one of the most interesting and remarkable sections of this book is devoted to the public displays of dancing boys tamasha which occur at the feast of beiram it is too long for extract but will be found on pp 105110 of vol i the complex and comprehensive system of pauperism obtaining at tashkend in central asia is almost worthy of a subsidised irish parish the account of it is followed by notices of opiumeaters among the sarts not materially different from what we know the kirghiz falconers are a most picturesque set and they carry their birdsgolden eagles the text calls themhooded with leather and upon their hands they cast them off in the mediaeval fashion and use them to kill foxes hawks are employed in a similar manner how russia has crept upon china is shown in many passages of the book in none more clearly than the following the south tarbagotai detachment of 130 cossacks largely armed with flint muskets dating from the beginning of the century and two guns was in 1870 on the frontier near the little river bachty this frontier was very like what farmers in surrey and hampshire whose land abuts on common land felicitously call  a rolling fence the detachment was originally quartered in urdshar  whence it has moved gradually forward till it has reached its present station and has thus extended the russian frotier by about 100 versts between 1850 and 1860 many districts in the neighbourhood of urdshar still belonged to the chinese now they have not a single acre of land within a radius of 100 versts thus russia grows from day to day nay from hour to hour  but if it goes on growing like this adds m yerestchagin drily the consequences will be serious here is what our author saw of the results of the mohammedan rebellion against the chinese government in the region of tchugutchak   presently large clumps of trees were visible in the distance on both sides of the road marking the farms of which there were many round tchugutchak about two versts outside the town we baw several ruined houses and chapels the paintings on the walls were still uninjured some splendid old trees were still standing but quite dead for the irrigation canals are silted up and the soil is quite dry in the town similar sights meet the eye wonderful groves and avenues the work of years are sometimes completely destroyed or going to decay as you approach the town it is hard to believe it is empty  you cannot help hoping to meet some human being if it be only a robber but not a soul is to be seen anywhere the houses are for the most part uninjured and likewise the paintings on the walls and the wooden latticework of the windows potsherds and fragments of articles of every conceivable kind were lying all aboutvessels of iron and clay of all sizes a quantity of copper coins strung on a string dresses caps plaits of hair shoes of all sizes the clumsy bhoes of dunghans and calmucks side by side with the miniature slippers of chinese women 1 put a pair of extraordinarily small slippers in my pocket as a memento but above all skulls are to be seen lying about everywhere the town is like a vast tomb and the whole impression it produces is terrible i wandered about for a whole day in bs company and then for several days alone without being able to accustom myself to this stillness as of the grave and to the sight of all these streets chapels theatres and squares standing for ever empty the gate of the fortress which the besiegers had blown in is still tolerably strong near the gate is to be seen the entrance into the subterranean gallery by which the besiegers after a long and tedious siege made their way into the fortress then came a merciless butchery in which no one was spared skulls and bones lie literally in heaps against the walls here and all around the fortress at many points e g by several of the gates the skulls were piled up to a great height in the fields round the town too lie skulls  as far as the eye can reach skulls and skulls and again skulls the wolves and the jackals have already done their work  the ravens are still engaged in picking the bones clean for the sun and rain to bleach one of the farms in particular which lie nearest the town abounds in bones a body of calmucks fifteen thousand strong came this way to help the besieged  but a force of only a few hundred dunghans fell upon them drove them back and killed them to the very last man what wonderful energy on the part of the insurgent mohammedans what cowardice on the part of the chinamen  i had enough to occupy me from the governors palaoe to the simple little houses of the common people all the dwellings were habitable all were painted all decorated with paintings sculptures basreliefs flowers dragons 6c theatres of an original construction buddhist temples in which some colossal idols were still intact though the mohammedans evidently showed great zeal in overthrowing these and breaking them in pieces seemed almost to be waiting for the people to throng in to their prayers and their amusements for three whole weeks i lived with one cossack and one tartar in a wretched cabin outside the walls of the fortress and every day from morning till evening i roamed about looking at everything drawing and painting occasionally a wild goat would stray into the courtyard where i was painting stand transfixed with astonishment and then rush off at full speed across the steppe making ample allowance for m yerestchagins professional love of effect and his characteristic delight in strong local colours here is a

B2597,"['8592699', '6672445']",  litetature daniel deronda daniel deronda by george eliot london w blackwood and sons we know not which to admire most in  daniel deronda the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as gwendolen and daniel deronda or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at derondas wedding feast  the entire cohen family with the one exception of though baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home in none of george eliots novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present one cannot lay down though last volume of  daniel deronda without some tribute of astonishment at though vast range of the authors powers it is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of english societya great work of course in either view on the whole perhaps ones impression is that in  daniel deronda george eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place and a novelist in the second the purely pictorial purpose in this as in others of her novels is subordinate to the ethical in  daniel deronda strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist the dominant motive as revealed in the last volume of the work is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time in its last pages instead of an invitation to esthetic or humorous reverie we seem to find a trumpetcall to young men and maidensto young men to take example by the noble gravity of daniel deronda and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of gwendolen harleth and its tragic consequences a protest against low sordid personal aims an incentive to a higher worthier more aspiring and humane life such would seem to be the ruling intention of daniel deronda wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are which may satisfy though flaunting gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities the earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of though elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes and the full earnestness of the authors purpose was not certain till the very last and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind this says much for though success with which george eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should as a whole point somewhere teach some lesson have some aspiration towards the infinite all through the skilful dissection of gwendolens heartlessness which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon we feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology by a most skilful professor of the social microscope this creature a product of the generation is dissected before us and put piece by piece under the glass wo look on peep in our turn through the instrument and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure professor eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments but having completed her pathological lecture she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature an undeveloped organ  note this i will return to it another time in though course of though exposition we have become deeply interested in this organ and byandby our curiosity is gratified we aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system it seems as if george eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of casaubon and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of gwendolen and mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and lightheaded conceit and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm there must be hundreds of girls more or less like gwendolen among george eliots readers and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies perhaps if george eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint she ought to have increased gwendolens punishment for after all gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles being left with two thousand ayear and a developed conscience and free to marry if she chooses a hearty handsome young cousin whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days but then gwendolens crime after all was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened and her wicked husband is drowned if grandcourt had turned np again or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning but it would have been too miserable besides that if sho had been left in physical misery we could not have had though same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration if gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period daniel deronda is equally an example to the young man of though period in the gravity and loftiness of his aims our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig and would jeer at his relations with gwendolen as impossible  and their judgement of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race his grave meditative nature his profound composure and selfcontrol his steady persistent passion are eminently hebraic and are meant to be so he is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin it is an influence too to which in our earnest moments we are not incapable of yielding ourselves and with the healthiest of results there is a something in it also which is repellent to the average common sense of englishmen that something is well expressed by sir hugo mullinger an admirably drawn type of the cultivated english squire i have long expected something remarkable from you dan  but for gods sake dont go into any eccentricities i can tolerate any mans difference of opinion hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic at this stago of though world if a man wants to be tikn seriously ho must keep clear of melodrama dont misunderstand mo i am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account i only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic especially if he wanted defending you have a passion for people who arc pelted dan im sorry for them too but so far as company goes its a kid ground of selection still sir hugo does not quarrel with daniel deronda for his innacy ho respects his earnestness and here again he is typical of his countrymen by far the most wonderful part of  daniel deronda its chief claim to admiration as an achievement is its picture of the jews its exemplification and analysis of different forms of jewish life some of them not so estimable as deronda and mordecai we have spoken of the cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work in the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of lapidoth mirahs father who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some musiclessons ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat  thc look of impudent suavity the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the hebrew race the interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond who has something of the character of charles mathewss awful dad and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated is very finely conceived there are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making lapidoths impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his sons stern rebuke  or who having done so would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek the humour of lapidoths subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to mordecai and deronda and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry is exquisite george eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly among the minor characters in  daniel deronda  there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is lapidoth when we think of all that there is in daniel deronda we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist still wthen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art we must admit that it has deficiencies it is a subepidermic subcutaneous kind of art the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology it is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness and that dullness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment the novel is not a work of art pure and simple but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts there is a want of courage in george eliot she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves she must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing what principles of their nature they are illustrating she is too professorial too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him nevertheless she is a great writer a great genius and if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum total  literature daniel deronda by george eliot edin burgh and london w blackwood  sons 187g independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections daniel deronda is eminently interesting because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light though merits as well as the faults of its writer merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated and are not as is too frequently the case blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of english letters on the one hand we are prepared to find and we do find an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character  a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade attitudes transient moods of mind complex feelings and the like which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer  an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims and a wonderful sympathy with humanity so far at least as it is congenial to the writer on the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and onesided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent to this black list must be added some decided faults in style in discussing a book which is in everybodys hands it will be well to show how the above points are brought out and how they affect the general merit of the book rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot in the matter of character then wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture the part of gwendolen harleth is throughout an overwhelming success and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch her selfwilled youth the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character which her selfconfidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her her instant surrender at though touch of material discomfort  the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit the helpless outbursts of selfpity of rage of supplication which follow that collapse  the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience  the torrent of remorse and final prostration of willare all imagined with a firmness and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence which cannot but command admiration the husband is almost equally admirable  indeed ones admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly and that the author would like ns to detest grandcourt yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait as he appears before us acting with strict politeness to his wife in no way violent towards ber if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language and employing for the purposes of his refined tyranny nothing stronger than the methods of  awful rule and right supremacy if he should appear to anyone all the more detestable it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival the more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them and an additional interest is impaitcd by the discovery that gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of dorothea animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy it might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that though soul of casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as grandcourt but these nro fancies the point of present importance is that though interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so of the third according to though authors design the first personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken the blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coatcollar continually who at the age of some twenty years wished  to get rid of a merely english attitude in studies  who in the words of his best friend was disposed  to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium   of whom it was impossible to believe in the still more graphic words of the friends sister  that he had a tailors bill and used boothooks who never does a wicked thing and never says one that is not priggishis a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike but refuse to admit him as possible only once perhaps is he humanwhen he persuades himself on all sorts of ethicophysicohistorical grounds that he should like to be a jew solely becauso as that very sensible woman his mother the princess discovers at once he wishes to marry a fascinating jewess we cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this  faultless monster  as hero though pleas put forward in the book that it is only though  average man  and the  dull man  that will not understand him and that the average man is not very clear about though structure of his own retina and the dull mans  dullness subsists notwithstanding his lack of belief in it in the first place the cases are not parallel for though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough and in the second place though dull man may fairly retort  if you are a great novelist make me believe in your characters in this dearth or rather distortion of central interest the minor characters do not help us much they are far less individual and far less elaborate than is usual with george eliot daniel deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of mdmes holt and cadwalladcr poy ser and glegg sir hugo mullinger with hans meyrick and his sister mab makes a shift to fill up the gap but it is but a shift lapidoth the unwelcome father is chiefly welcome to us the readers because ol the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers mordecai we must not we suppose call a minor character but of him more hereafter there is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which george eliot has accustomed us though account of gwendolens grounds of confidence  the charming etching of though wagon passing pennieote keeto ry the scene of thc first ride with grandcourt gwendolen nfl cr klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover the wonderful sketch of grandcourt sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature deronda in the synagogue the stables at the abbey  thc waiting at genoa for the princess  and lastly gwendolens retrospect of ofleiulonc are all effects ofthe finest in this kind but this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed as it seems t o us in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in themselves and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged might have freer play no one can read daniel de rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that though author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed we cannot away in a novel with emotive memory and dynamic quality with  hymning of cancerous vices  and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss with  coercive types  and  spiritual perpetuation still less with hundreds ol phrases less notable because bulkier xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough and they are all more or less intelligible to decentlyeducated people no doubt though truths of science mental and physical are here as elsewhere in our authors works rendered with astonishing correctness and facility but it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate in philosophy in politics in religion in art a novelist when he speaks in his own person should have no opinion should be of no sect should indulge in no argot if we are dissatisfied with though jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition we do not in the slightest degree feel  imperfect sympathy with jews and we hold that shylock had the best of the argument but the question here is whether the phase of judaism now exhibited the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle we think that it has not and we are not to be converted by references to the average man the average man has never experienced the passion of hamlet of othello or of lear he is not capable of the chivalry of esmond of the devotion of des grieux of the charity of the vicar of wakefield but he has experienced and he is capable of something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms now the  samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine to borrow a phrase from allon locke into which mordecai initiates deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human they aro not only  willworship but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling poetry could legitimately treat them indeed many of mordecais traits may be recognised as we think moro happily placedin though sephardo of the spanish gypsy they are no doubt interesting historically they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph but for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest of prose novels should be wrought it is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with though manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of mordecai probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic if though thing was to be done it could hardly have been done better assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive we should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion which characterise the subjects and situations of the authors earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present it is a timehonoured transition and one which has before now yielded excellent results but in reality the transition is not in this case great because the subjectmatter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment the book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of george eliots work which lurks even in the scenes of clerical life which is hardly in abeyance in adam bede which is though professed motive of the mill on the floss of the spanish gypsy and of romola which gives charm to the slightness of silas mar uer  to wit the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty hither than the op posing instinct all for love and the world well lost perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application but this is matter of opinion the matter of fact remains that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between gwendolens misery and the prosperity of the sleek deronda the same moral as we had in hettys catastrophe in the fate which punished maggie tullivers partial declension from the standard in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from duke silvas passion in the degradation and death of tito melema though same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of felix holt for a hero and of dorothea brook for a heroine the moral and the standard and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity and deal deserved rebuke to though lax pleasureseeking which has been considered a vice at all times and is not openly considered a virtue even yet in though illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits and much exquisitelydrawn surrounding but perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the immutable law that no perfect novel can ever be written in designed illustration of a theory whether moral or immoral and that art like atticus and the turk will bear no rival near the throne george

his part well and much lessens our reirnt at the want of mr seymours spirited hand  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited toy boz london chapman and hall 186 strand wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughterloving mortals these memoirs contain some account of the adventures of mr pickwick the founder and messrs tupman winkle and snodgrass three of the members of the club in search not of the picturesque like dr syntax but of information concerning men and manners for the instruction and edification of the members of the society of course the story is merely a framework in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befell these gentlemen in the course of their travels the comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts and for poetry at least poetry of a serious character we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever to borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the  joy green when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse its a very slight affair and the only excuse i have for having ever perpetrated it is that i was a young man at the time the style of ideas brought into fashion bv monk lewis and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of barry cornwall has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste and consigned to the  tomb of all the capulets  and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of thomas moore are excused only by their exquisite matter or by the kwill which h rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords but such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of longtried ingenuity having thus blamed what we consider blameable it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise the scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause the mind which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein a scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house not a hundred miles from westminsterbridge is well worthy of perusal and in short if we were to particularise all that is good we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest we should reprint half of the contents we give one extract which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the pickwick club and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers shops we have passed for some time since it should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish seymour but since his lamented

married and mr pickwick settled took lodgings at richmond where he has ever since resided he walks constantly on the terrace during the summer months with a youthful and janty air which has rendered

his word and remained unmarried for two years the old housekeeper dying at the end of that time mr pickwick promoted mary to tbt situation oa condition of her marrying mr weller at once which she did without a murmur from the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden we have reason to suppose that sam has some family the elder mr weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire the contents of the pocketbook had been so well invested for him however by mr pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent publichouse near shooters hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with mr pickwick and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows mr pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing sam weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind which never failed to afford mr pickwick great amusement he was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy mr snodgrass mr winkle and mr trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to mr jingle for both that person and job trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations he is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit aad may still be frequently seen contemplating

great respect the children idolise him nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood every year he repairs to a large family merrymaking at mr wardlea on this as on all other occasions he is invariably

author has had to contend with in his undertaking and a dedication are given in the last number the dedication is to mr sergeant talfourd  mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country and of the lasting benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their works  the posthumous papers ofthe pickwick club edited by boz jno viii chapman and hall we continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy original and unaffected powers displayed in them we should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome there is no flagging in this number before us every stroke of the writers humour the most common or the most careless tells to a desired effect and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous is thoroughly mastered here we should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the comic tn the heartrending calamities of common life as in its sidesplitting oddities and humours the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled the number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old lawclerk on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old inns of court mr pickwick stares at him in silence the old gentleman resumes with a leer   look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic  what fine places of slow torture they are think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him the waitingthe hopethe disappointmentthe fearthe miserythe poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his careerthe suicide perhaps or better still the shabby slipshod drunkard am i not righi about them eh  and the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject mr pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence  talk of your german universities said the little old man pooh pooh theres romance enough at home without going half a mile for it  only people never tb ink of it  i never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said mr pickwick laughing  to be sure you didnt  said the little old man a of course not as a friend bit of it said he he

remarkable circumstance sir said sam  that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together u l dont underataad you sam said mr pickwick a what i mean sir said sam  is that the poorer a place is the

before aid mr pickwick  the very first place we stop at ill make a note of by this time they had reached the turnpike at mile end a profound silence prevailed until they had got two or three miles further on when mr weller senior turning suddenly to mr pickwick said  wery queer life is a pikekeepers sir  a what  said mr pickwick  a pikekeeper  what do you mean by a pikekeeper  inquired mr peter magnus  the old un means a turnpikekeeper genlmn observed mr weller in explanation  oh said mr pickwick  i see yes very curious life very uncomfortable  theyre all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said mr weller senior  ay ay   said mr pickwick  yes consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls n deat me said mr pickwick  i never knew that before  fact sir said mr weller  if they was genlmn youd cali era misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pikekeepin all this is excellent but the wit of boz excellent as it is has not exhausted this subject of turnpikes he may return to it with some effect we look upon it as only another strong proof of their misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind that they are specially called trusts because they all declare  no trust it is malice and false pretence the elder mr weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son we will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to sam when he is obliged to resume the reins for london   pm a goin to leave you samivel my boy and theres no telling ven i shall see you again your motherinlaw may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened

yourself and youll be glad on it afterwards with these affecting words mr weller looked steadfastly on his son nnd turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight we see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the papers of the pickwick  the posthumous papers of the pickwickian club indited by bo and the library of fiction  or lui utily story teller boz marches on triumphantly and has completely taken possession of the ear and of the hearts too of his countrymen his fifth number is joyous in the scenes of a contested election and the honest wonder and indignation ol the great mr pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming the contents of the  story teller  this month are all good and two of the pieces are original the one jesse chile by miss mitford and  the alchymist by mr harvey this is really a great advance upon the last hoing thus this periodical cannot fail to do well  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club  containing a faithful record of thc perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions of the correspotiding members edited by boz with illustrations the public have now had a full dozen of these papers and they are cager for a dozen more they seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed instead of flagging they grow more uproarious in their fun and more rich in their drollery we like this number the best of any that have yet appeared still it has a striking fault and we shall take this opportunity of reading master boz a friendly lecture in public that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private when he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of everyday life he should always be not only strictly possible but even probable thus if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera we give him a little latitude as to his proportions and the free use of his colours  but should he choose to paint a pig it must be a pig and nothing else but a pig that he paints or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure the trial scene that makes the interest of this volume is as familiar to his readers as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty  and everybody who reads it knows badly as much of our judicature is conducted that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced this is a pity inasmuch as it has no thing to do with the humour of the proceedings if it were necessary for the following out of the story that the venerable and muchtobeidolized pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages the evidence against him should have been made strongerthe misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away however ull this may not have struck the million but we will still maintain that however wild may be the fiction or rampant the humour of a literary production all the groundwork upon which it is erected such as the face of the country the manners of the time and the operations of public institutions should be strictly in accordance with truth  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club containing a faithful record of the perambulations ptriis travels adventures and sporting transactions of the corresponding members edited bv box with illustrations boz iroes on triumphing and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct the seventh number of this pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six the sporting excursion on the 1st of september which was undertaken with all the strength of the club still more strong in its adjutant sam weller is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read the impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow among the pigs and the asses in the tillage receptacle for the wandering is a happy hit and though a most powerful still a most probable one for quiet humour and keen satirical acumen the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed the next number promises us a rich treat wo are just admitted into the vestibule with the foldingdoors partially opened that are to disclose some rich scenesupon which we are impatient to enter  posthumous leapers of the pickwick club containing a faithful pecord of the lramhnhttions perils travels adventures anil sport ing transactions of thc corresponding me min rs tlil iii edited by boz v itu illustrations very good this number the eleventh indeed sam weller improves upon acquaintance the world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular the renowned mr pickwick is himself the legitimate successor to don quixote  indeed he is the cockney quixote of the nineteenth century and instead of armour of iron he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat and instead of spear and sword has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler the wrongdoer and the oppressor of the innocent wc wish that the humorous boz would call to mind that the knight of la mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame we should like to see mr pickwick confess to the soft impeachment this gentlemans attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heartwe trust that it will not ascend to his head but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else wc know of no

that dt tte worthy magistrate having once rushed into a prize ring attended by only sixty special constables and  at the hazard of foiling st sacrifice to the angry passions of an infuriated multitude prubi bited a pugilistic contest between the middlesex dumpling and though suffolk bantam crummer proceeds with bis warrants to though hotel of the pickwickians and insinuates himself into their presence mr grummers mode of proceeding was professional bot peculiar hie first act was to bolt the door on the inside his second to polish ms head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief his third to jaoco his hat with the cotton handkerchief in it on the nearest chair and rn fourth to produce from the breastpocket of his coat a short truncheon sui ujowuted by a brazen crown with which he beckoned to mr pickwick with a grave aad ghostlike air mr snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence he looked steadily at mr grummer for a brief space and then said emphaticallya this is a private room sira private room mr grummer shook his head and replied no rooms private to his majesty when the street doors once passed thats law some people maintains that an englishmans house is hit castle thats gammon a scene of great spirit and humour follows which ends in mr pickwicks obeying thc laws of his country and entering a sedanchair with mr tupman for the

magistrate going as dont commit himself twice as often as he commits other people at this sally another special laughed and then tried to look so tuperoatu rally solemn that the magistrate detected him immediately an inimitably humorous passage ensues in which it appears eer tain that the inst named unlucky special must have been committed  only that mr jinks who is the magistrates adviser having bad k legal education of three years in a country attorneys office whispers the magistrate that bc thinks it wouldnt do and so mr nop kins makes a speech and says that in consideration of the specials family he shall merely reprimand and discharge him poor mr jinks afterwards saves the  tremendous mr nupkins from anally committing mr pickwick without a hearing that illustrious maa is

true to nature than these extracts we have given we have great pleasure in quoting this just tribute to geuius from blackwoods magazinebut blackwood bas always had a generous sympathy with talent aod genius for its great writer is himself of the brotherhood44 but there are higher works of which twill be our hint to speakworks of poweray of geniussnd we must begin with bulwer his tame is fixed and on a wide foundation in his provinceand it is a noble oneis be since the death of the unapproachable u the foremost man of all the world   thc easiest and shortest way to prove that he is not would be to show who is privileged to take precedence ofthe author of paul cu ff tr j and eugene aram washington irving no cooper no his name does not occur to us at this moment but perhaps we may find it in the london beview  that posthumous payers of the pkhtrick cm edited by box no 7 chapman and hall this is beyond a doubt the most original and amusing series of comic sketches that have been published in our time and we are inclined to think the present number so far as they have gone the best of them the jest is kent up with excellent breadth of humour and a most studied insight into the niceties and peculiarities of character scene after scene is worked out as if on the spur of the occasion without much appearance of any previous bias or ultimate purpose but always broadly and powerfully and from a rich rein of comic invention the style continues racy and unaffected the writer reminds us frequently in his ingenuity in the vivacity of his talents in the wonderful local truth of his pictures and in the general accuracy of his observation and humour as well as in the ease and animation of his manner of the elder english comedies and farces he has a share of the ludicrous invention of vanbrugh and touch of the higher powers of wycherley the number before us opens with a serious imputation on the character of mr winkie whose friendly attentions to mrs pott the wife of the redoubted editor of the eatanstrill gazette were remarked upon in a previous number as mr winkle is sitting in mr potts breakfast room in all the unconscious simplicity of perfect innocence mr p enters and calls him a  serpent mr w very naturally supposes this to be a piece of pleasantry we recommend what follows to the reader in the hope that none of our contemporaries will suppose its allusions levelled at them   pleasantry sir  exclaimed pott with a motion of the hand indicative of a strong desire to hurl the britannia metal teapot at the head of his visitor u pleasantry sir but no i will be calm swill be calm sir and in proof of his calmness mr pott flung himself into a chair and foamed at the mouth  my dear sir interposed mr winkle  dear sir  replied pott  how dare vou address me as dear sir sir  how dare you look me in the face and do it   well sir if you come to that responded mr winkle  how dare yon look me in the face and call me a serpent sir   because you are one replied mr pott  prove it sir said mr winkle warmly  prove it a malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the independent of that morning and laying his finger on a particular paragraph threw the journal across the table to mr winkle that gentleman took it np and read as follows   our obscure and filthy contemporary in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood to the personal affairs of our late candidateaye and notwithstanding his base defeat we will add our future member mr fizkin what does our dastardly contemporary mean  what would the ruffian say if we setting at naught like him the decencies of social intercourse were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule not to say from general execration  what if we were even to point ont and comment on facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious and beheld by every one but our moleeyed contemporarywhat if we were to print the following effusion which we received while we were writing the commencement of this artiele from a talented fellowtownsman and correspondent    lines to a brass pot   oh pott if youd known how false shed hare grown when you heard the marriage hells tinkle youd have done then i vow what you cannot help now and handed her over to w     v   what said mr pott solemnly what rhymes to  tinkle villain   what rhymes to tinkle  said mrs pott whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply  what rhymes to tinkle  why winkle i should conceive and saying this mrs pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed pickwickian and extended her hand towards him the agitated young maa would have accepted it in his confusion had not pott indignantly interposed  back maamback said the editor  take his hand before my very face ln  mr p said his astonished lady  wretched

mrs pott stooping to pick up the pantr  upon my word sir mr pot winced beneath the contemptuous gate of his wife he had made a desperate straggle to screw op his courage but it was fast coming uasorewed again there appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence  upon my word sir when it comes to be read but the tone of voice io which h was delivered and the look that accompanied it

ingenious young man that sam said mr pickwick with a slight shudder  just was sir replied mr weller continuing his occupation of emptying the basket  and the pies was beautiful we began by describing an imputation on the character of mr winkle and we regret to say that before the number closes mr pickwick himself plays some opening passages in the part of defendant in an action for  breach of promise his visit to the office of messrs dodson and fogg is inimitably toldthe sketch of the clerks is finished adunguem but we must pass these and also the sharp lineaments of captain boldwig and likewise the choice spirits assembled at the magpie and stump for the purpose of introducing the father of mr weller and the scene of his affectionate recognition sam and mr pickwick have turned in for a few minutes to a house of refreshment by way of relief from thc toils of a very anxious afternoon m the room was one of a very homely description and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen for several gentlemen who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession were drinking and smoking in the different boxes among the number was one stout redmeed elderly man in particular seated in an opposite box who attracted mr pickwicks attention the stout man was smoking with great vehemence but between every halfdozen puffs he took his pipe from nis mouth and looked first at mr weller and then at mr pickwick then he would bury in a juart pot as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving and take another look at sam and mr pickwick then he would take another halfdozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again and at last the stout man putting up his legs on the eat and leaning his back against the wall began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all and to stare through the smoke at the new comers as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them at first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped mr wellers observation but by decrees as he saw mr pickwicks eyes every now and then turning towards lum he began to gaze in the same direction at the same time shading his eyes with nis hand as if he partially recognised the object before him and wished to make quite sure of its identity his doubts were speedily dispelled however for the stout man having blown a thick cloud hom his pipe a hoarse voice like some strange effort of ventriloquism emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest and slowly uttered these sounds vy sammy  whos that sam  inquired mr pickwick  why i wouldnt ha believed it sir replied mr weller with astonished eyes  its the old un  old one said mr pickwick  what old one    my father sir replied mr weller  how are you my ancient and with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection mr weller made room on the seat beside him fbr the stout roan who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand to greet him  vy sammy said the father  i hant seen you for two years and better  nor more you have old codger replied the son  hows mother in law    vy ill tell you what sammy said mr weller senior with much solemnity in his manner  there never was a nicer woman as a widder than that ere second wentur o minea sweet cretur she was sammy and all i can say on her now is that aa she was such an uncommon pleasant widder its a great pity ahe ever changed her condition she dont act as a vife sammy  dont she though   inquired mr weller junior the elder mr weller shook his head as he replied with a sigh ive done t once too often sammy ive done it once too often the illustrations are excellent they are quite equal to the best attempts of mr seymour in the early numbers  the posthumous pt

w boz and thc library of fiction consisting of critical fssaijs talcs tad sketches of character wv notice these two works together because together they first appeared and together we are in the habit of receiving them at the beginning of each month but the race is all in favour of the pickwick club elderly though its members be and very obese its renowned chairman and sundry of its members  bo is making for himself a standard fame and this number is perhaps the best that luis yet appeared the witjif these papers is subtle and beneath the surface  their humour is not that of extravagance but of nature the laugh that the author has raised against the strenuous trilling oj antiquarianism is a fair laugh and it is exquisitely excited the whole thing is well clone and we shall say no more in the library of fiction the k diary of a surgeon does not improve  sandie saudeman the piper will be pleasing to a certain class of readers and of the nonoriginal papers we shall say nothing thc redeeming point of this number is tk the sybils stone by the author of the  gentleman in black though the idea has often been worked up before yet it is so pleasantly done that we do not regret its want of novelty we wish well to this periodical and we trust that in its next number it will put forth greater strength even the engravings are infinitely inferior to those of its pickwickian brother  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club by boz nos 1 to 6 chapman and hall as a lively caricaturist the author of these papers may take rank with some of the best comic writers in the language in hitting off the eccentricities of life few have excelled him his style is fresh and racy and has all the stamp of an original spirit the reader will thank us for the extracts we are about to make if he bas not already had the good fortune to meet with thc papers themselves the idea worked out is that of a  faithful record of the perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions ofthe corresponding members of a cockney club founded by mr pickwick  for the promotion of science thc advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning the corresponding members consist of thc illustrious founder himself whose character is sustained throughout with a very romantic gravity and of messrs tupman snodgrass and winkle who are respectively distinguished by admiration ofthe fair sex a taste for poetry and a sporting turn the different parties play upon one anothers failings and into one anothers handsthc plot of their adventures is kept up with infinite liveliness bustle point and interestand many neb sources of the truly ludicrous are opened tne nature of mr pickwicvs observations on the various towns that are visited may be gathered from an abridgment of what he

delicious to those who are extremely fend of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying our next extract is an admirable picture of a family party the travellers have been invited to the house of a goodhumoured country gentleman mr wardle some strokes of character in the following description of the scene of their reception are truly excellent for humour force and reality a very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gownno less a personage than mr wardle s motheroccupied the post of honour on the righthand comer of the chimneypiece and various certificates of her having been brought up ia the way ihe should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk teakettle holders of a more modern period the au ut the two young ladies and mr wardle each vying with the other in paving zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lad crowded round her easy chair one holding her eartrumpet another an orange and a third a smellingbottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support on the opposite side sat a baldheaded old gentleman with a goodhumoured benevolent facethe clergy noan of dingley dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery ot manufacturing homemade cordials greatly to other peoples satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own a little hardheaded ripstone pippinfaced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman n one corner ana two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat biltupright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mr pickwick and bis fellowvoyagers mr pickwick mother said mr wardle at the very top of his voice  ah maid the old lady shaking her head  i cant hear you  mr pickwick grandma  screamed both the young ladies together  ah  exclaimed the old lady well it dont much matter he dont grasping the old ladys hand care for an old ooman like me i dare say u i assure you maam said m r pickwick and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance  i assure vou ma am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well 44 ah  said the old lady after a short pause  its all very fine i dare ssy bot i cant bear him u grandmas rather put out now said miss isabella wardle in a low tone  but shell talk to vou presently mr pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle  delightful situation this said mr pickwick u delightful echoed messrs snodgrass tupman and winkle  welt i think it is said mr wardle  there aint a better ipot o ground in all kent sir said the hardheaded man with the pippinface there aint indeed sirfm sure there aint sir  and the hardheaded man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very muck contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last 44 there aint a better spot o ground in all kent said the hardheaded man again after a pause u cent mullins meadows observed the fat man solemnly u mullios meadows  ejaculated the other with profound contempt  ah mullins meadows repeated the fat man  heglar good land that interposed another fat man  and so it is surely said a third fat man  everybody knows that said the corpulent host the hardheaded man looked dubiously round but finding himself in a minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more  what are they talking about  inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice tor like roany deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself  about the land grandma  what about the land nothing the matter is there  u no no mr miller was saying our land was better than mullins meadows  how should he know anything about it  inquired the old lady indignantly u millers a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him i said so saving which the old lady ouite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper drew herself up and looked carvingknives at the hardheaded delinquent  come come said the bustling host with a natural anxiety to change the conversationu w hat say you to a

B368,['2449598'],  fiction the exquisite perdita by e barrington harrap 7s 6d if anyone thinks that the historical novel is dead a perusal of the works of the lady who writes under the name of  e barrington should undeceive him the author of these romances has a rare power of visualising the past combined with a decided talent for dialogue and command of literary expression though she may perhaps be charged with looking at life very largely from the standpoint of her own sex she does not make the mistake of so many clever women in treating the man as a mere foil for the portrayal of female activities and excellences in her latest book a masterly study of sentimentality the readers interest will be almost equally divided between the actress who became the first mistress of george iv as prince of wales and sheridan who are represented as half in love with one another some of the best work is in the earlier chapters where the brilliant dramatist and drury lane proprietor is shown cajoling garrick to prepare perdita for a stage career and shielding her from the advances of wouldbe admirers whilst combating his own inclinations skilful use is made of the personality of his adorable wife reynoldss st cecilia in warding off undesirable complications and the latters own pathetic situation affords an effective underplot the sordid worthlessness which was hidden under the showy splendours of the prince who wooed the young actress as  florizel is relentlessly brought out and the exposure though couched under the form of fiction is more sound historically than recent attempts to whitewash him by pseudobiography some of the later episodes of the book though remarkable as tours de force notably the scene between perdita and the duke and duchess of cumberland the real villains of the piece are scarcely so convincing and the relations here depicted of the discarded mistress with charles james fox cannot be pronounced more than plausibly credible though some colour may be lent to them by the popular belief the curious in biographic fiction may contrast with the treatment of the perdita episode the equally remarkable study on the same theme by the late stanley makower if they can obtain it g le g n,biography

praise upon the publication before us this novel we have always held to be one of the best if not the very best of its class chaste yet witty it can boast of excessive purity without tininess turns morality into loveliness anti proves religion to be the very highest state of mortal enjoyment this work is the voice of innocencelow vet beautifully distinct from its excessive sweetness anti so persuasive that we feel assured it can come only from the seclusion where vice has never dared to enter and where it fails to make a proselyte it must fall upon a heart unwin thy to enjoy what is beautiful anti unable to appreciate what is virtuous  the literary examiner sense and snsibility by miss austen standard novels vol xniii bentley there we few works of fiction so acceptable in republication as the novels of miss austen they never weary their interest is sever lost for as in the prints of hogarth we find fresh matter for admiration upon every renewal of our acquaintance her fables ore of the simplest construction her incidents in the common course of things and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation the story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases there are no exaggerations and no deficiencies and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fullness of the effect is produced the persons described are such as we meet every day in society but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of actionthe one illustrating the otherand moreover most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates self is a great disturber of the observing faculties in miss austens novels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world and free from the engrossment of acting a part in it we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked the commonplace characters of the town and the village are the characters which miss austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood in the story before us what an example of the worthless is mr johii dashwoodnot the wormhless in the common acceptation of the word implying positive vice but the worthless negative of worth of which common character miss austen has evinced a perfect comprehension and presented various illustrations mr john dashwood is incapable of a generous sentiment or a benevolent action but he is a rigid olserver of all the laws of the world and we know full well that so really despicable a man would pass as a very pattern of proprietya model man he has a wife all selfishness and worldliness who draws the pale of humanity round her own house to whom he looks up as he must to some one being of a parasitical genus with veneration consecrating all her foibles and almirilngly magnifying her littleness for one traitthe brother of this paragon marries beneath him as the world calls it though in this as in many other cases so described the match was an equal one for two narrow souls were attracted by the sympathy of meanness and literally contracted to each other the feelings of mrs john dashwood upon this trying occasion are described as follows by the adoring husbandwe think we hear the man speakas we read the letter and the very breaks are full of nature and denote the emphasis of his selfish concern your sister has suffered dreadfullyin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome poor fanny mrs john dashwood she was in hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much donovan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution elual to any thing she has born it all with the fortitude of an angel she says she never shall think well of any body again anl one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived csense and sensibility p 228 how exquisitely true to the sort of nature described is that unconscious satire  she has born it all unit the fortitude of an angel  she says she never shall think well of any body again angelic being mrs ferrars is another excellently drawn character one of those creatures cankered with wealth the tyrants of the moneybox the capricious despots of the last will and testament who make slaves of expectation and torment with fears of disappointment and cause the interested hopes of their death to be fraught with miseries and abasements during their lives her merit considered her perfection in one style miss austen is the worst appreciated novelist of her time she laboured under the disadvantage of ihaving the inferior stamp of circulatinglibrary popularity put upon her works before the superior judges had become acquainted with them and recognised their high degree of excellence the quarterly review to its honour be it remembered was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius it is remarkable that scott who noticed with praise many inferior authors never mentioned miss austen perhaps because she was not an inferior author perhaps for the same reason that caused sir walter to consider fieldings incomparable satire jonathan wild only as a story the present judicious blication is we see to be followed by  emma  northanier abbey  mansfield park and persuasion but suely it cannot be intended to omit  pride and prejudice which s at once the best and the most popular of the austen novels,biography

preferred to meet him at the famous breakfasttable these will now gladly welcome him again  over the teacups where lie discourses genially and wisely of men ard manners it is unnecessary to draw comparisons between his present conversations and those which some thirty years ago made him famous that he  feels he has something he would like to say  is his sufficient justification for the present work and there are plenty of people on both sides of the atlantic who will listen to him gladly we may however note in passing that the always genial doctor is now if possible more genial than ever even his old friend the new england deacon is not held up to ridicule among the characters that assemble around the teatable are two of our old familiar friends the autocrat himselfnow known as the  dictator though he dictates very little and indeed takes ostensibly only a small part of the conversationand the professor all the rest of the old company have departed and given place to new and not uninteresting guests among these is of course a doctor who is one of the parties in the slight loveromance that runs through the book that much of the talk relates to old age is natural enough seeing that the author has now completed his eightyone years and is not anxious to conceal the fact he seems to regard himself at this stage of life with something of the curious scientific or semiscientific interest which hitherto he has always manifested with reference to external things he studies his sensations and notes the gain and the lossbeing quite alive to the privileges as well as to the imonveniences connected with his time of life ie is of opinion that 4 old age is infinitely more cheerful for intelli gent people at least than it was two or three thousand years ago it is our duty so far as we can to keep it so there will always be enough about it that is solemn and more than enough alas that is saddening but how much there is in our times to lighten its burdens  if they that look out at the windows be darkened the optician is happy to supply them with eyeglasses for use before the public and spectacles for their hours of privacy if the grinders cease because they are few they can be made many again by a third dentition which brings no toothache in the train by temperance and good habits of life proper clothing wellwarmed welldrained and wellventilated dwellings and sufficient but not too much exercise the old man of our time may keep his muscular strength in very good condition dr holmes is by no means an enthusiastic admirer of 1the good old times le believes in the things and the men of today if the match were possible he says he would be prepared to back mr gladstone for a hundred shekels against caleb that overconfident old israelite to cut down and chop up a cedar of lebanon about many other topics which interest him dr holmes takes the present opportunity of discoursing he is somewhat severe on the persons he styles braintappers those literary operatives who address persons whose names are well known to the public asking their opinions or their experiences on subjects which are at the time of general interest the object with which the braintapper puts his questions may lie admits be a purely benevolent and entirely disinterested one but this is not always the case in many instances the braintapper  is acting much as those persons do who stop a physician in the street to talk with him about their livers or stomachs or other internal arrangements instead of going to his office and consulting him expecting to pay for his advice others are more like those busy women who having the generous intention of making a handsome present to their pastor at as little expense as may be send to all their neighbours and acquaintances for scraps of various materials out of which the imposing bedspread or counterpane is to be elaborated akin to the braintapper  is the writer of unnecessary communications who desires to express admiration or to seek information or to procure an autograph dr holmes confesses he has encouraged this vice he was willing to answer all correspondents as long as he was able but at length it became necessary to give notice that the letters books and pamphlets which reached him were too numerous to be attended to if he undertook to read and answer them all he would have little time for anything else it is gratifying to receive them no doubt when large numbers of strangers insist on claiming one as a friend on the strength of what he has written it tends to make him think of himself somewhat indulgently dr holmes hints at the difference that exists between the written and the unwritten answers to correspondents and remarks that 1the hypocrisy of kindhearted people is one of the most painful exhibitions of human weakness he gives a few specimens of the unwritten answers of which one may be quoted by way of example think the lines you mention are by far the best i ever wrote hey well i didnt write those lines what is more i think they are as detestable a string of rhymes as i could wish my worst enemy had written dr holmes concludes his present series of papers with the hope that he may yet meet his readers  in the now and then of the future we hope so too for many years to come lie has given us his views about old age and the world in general from the standpoint of eighty years we shall hope in due time to learn how he regards them at ninety wvalter lewin,biography

great wrong all bis novels and romances have been produced not to exemplify a single moral but to elucidate a theory work out a principle or establish a science to a superficial observer the last

to his reflections whilst his mind is open to every generous sentiment and his admiration and applause the free homage of every virtuous individual he begins to despise and despair of mankind in the mass he begins to understand what we have long knownthat as yet public virtue is like the clove sent forth from the ark on the face of the troubled waters she cannot from the overflowing seas of iniquity that cover the earth find anywhere a restingplace in the progress of knowledge she has certainly found an olivebrancha token of the subsiding of the waters but to the present era we see that the past affords no lesson and the future gives scarcely any hope even in mr bulwers sanguine mind the utopian dreams of patriotism and his faith in the public good brought about by public virtue are fast fading away and are rapidly giving place to a conviction that sharp realities only will urge man on over bis worldly course regardless of public honour wildlyextended views or the general wed

broils of faction and placing him in the temple of the muses he will there find his legitimate station his just triumph and his deserved immortality as a literary conqiosition 4fc llienzi the last of the tribunes may be classed as a familiar prose epic  whether we regard the unity of its action the eloquence of its diction or the high and the melancholy truth which it so beautifully enforces the story ocns with a loving and quiet scene between the elder llienzi the hero and a gentle being his brother in this interview the character of ola the predestined tribune is made to display itself very naturally and forcibly his is a mind of great imaginings imbued deeply with classic learning and panting after the regeneration of home isle is also proud of his illegitimate lineage derived from an emperor of germany at that time the representative of all that was left of the once universal empire at this period the city is distracted and devoured by the two contending factions of the colonna

imitating in a graceful manner thc conduct of the elder brutus though not to the extent to which that patriot is recorded to have went ile cola descended only to a witty buffoonery what he really thought of the men whose festive honours he enlivened by his facetiousness may be gathered from the following indignant burst   the colonna  said ola with a bitter smile   the colonnathe pedantsthey affect dull souls the knowledge of the past play the patron and misquote latin over their cups  they are pleased to welcome me at their hoard because the roman doctors call me learned and because

bitterness and the depth of the remark on that most plebeian of all ambitions the wish to rise by making oneself the tool or the parasite of a patron is here properly characterised  and shows the first dark dawning in the authors mind of the miserable light of one dismal truth of our fallen nature after this sweet interview with his brother over which is spread that wellsustained classicality

thoughts thoughts in which were the germ of a mighty revolution were at his heart he woke from them with a start as the soldiers were now arramring their bucklers so as to make a kind of bier for the corpse and then burst into tears as he fiercely motioned them away and clasped the clay to his breast till he was lite rally soaked with the oozing blood from that moment colas patriotism became nerved by revenge his whole soul rose at once in eternal hate against the nobles and rigidly and amply did he pay them back the devastation they had committed on his own race lt is not our purpose to follow the hero through the slow development of his plans his sagacious blinding of the aristocracy to his designs and his veiled and astute cultivation of the good opinion of the working classes here we may remark a singularity in this romance significantly indicative of a change in mr bulwers political opinions the only truly noble great and good character that he brings upon this exciting stage of action is a patrician adrian a branch of the colonna family of the women as they take the colouring of their minds from the men we need say nothing but of all the male characters with the exception of adrian llienzi among the rest are such as to make us loathe our common nature llienzis character is heroic but it cannot be called good great but incomplete  such an one as might create a faithful adherent but not one whom a pure mind would rejoice to hail as a familiar friend his author attempts to justify him from the imputation of that weakest of all weaknessesan affectation of the puerility of holiday pomp the very entertaining of such gilded hollowness argues pretension  and wherever there is pretension there is innate feebleness in some point of character we do not think that llienzi was justified in this foolish expense of wealth on the score of keeping up his popularity  for though it flattered the citizens upon whose good will his power was solely found in the end it undermined his strength with them as well as brought about the necessity of taxation  and attempted taxation did at last shed his blood in the very midst of his former idolaters one almost uninterrupted colour of black villany and of weakness worse even in its consequences than villainy itself is spread over the dramatis pcrsoncc of this intellectual work from the pope to the meanest official in religionfrom the statesman to the lowest jack in office from the general of armies to the degraded follower of the camp all all are miserable rascals there is no repose for the mind of the reader except in the one character that we have mentioned and in that of his betrothed irene the gentle and beautiful sister of the tribune finely has the author castigated and held up to immortal scorn the roman working classes and the democrats isle describes them and describes them truly as being as ambitious as revengeful as cruel as selfish and as weak as the nobles with all their vices made hideous by meanness the most disgusting and sordidness the most revolting for these frequent and not too highly coloured pictures conservatism will be eternally grateful to the author let us now suppose llienzi to have expelled the nobles from rome or made them reside there as simple quiet citizens demolished the fortifications of their strongholds hung up some of their number for what were looked upon formerly as mere casual occurrences a few murders or so cleared the roads of banditti brought profitable trade and overflowing plenty within the walls and administering justice with mercy seemed to have chained peace within the city by the rosy bonds of brotherly love between man and in manllienzi has done all this and now let us look at mr bulwers picture of democratic gratitude the greasy plebeians have grown fat under the beneficence of his sway their storehouses are full of merchandize and their purses full of florins all looks well and prosperous within their city but at the far off papal court of avignon the nobles are again making a demonstration and the popeo these popes  have excommunicated the tribune because he bathed in the same stone bath as the heathen emperor constantine wellone hundred and fifty freebooters in the pay of the patricians steal into the city and for tify themselves in one of the dismantled strongholds of the colonna only one hundred and

merchants and the shops with waresdefeated the boldest lords and fiercest soldiery of italy 44 4 and now wants to tax the peoplethats all the thanks we get for helping him said the grumbling cecco 4 what would he have been without uswe that made can unmake 44 4 lint continued the advocate seeing that he had his supporters 4 hut then he taxes us tor our own liberties  4 4 who strikes at them now asked the butcher 44  why the barons are daily mustering new strength at marino  44 4 marino is not home said luigi the butcher 4 lets wait till they come to our gates againwe know how to receive them though for the matter of that i think we have had enough fightingmy two poor brothers had each a stab too much for them why wont the tribune if th the he be a great man let us have peace all we want now is quiet 44 4 ah said a seller of horseharness 4 let him make it up wi barons they were good customers after all  4 for my part said a merrylooking fellow who had been a gravedigger in bad times and had now opened a stall of wares for the living  i could foi give him all but bathing in the holy vase of porphyry 44 4 ah that was a bail job said several shaking their heads 44 4 and the knighthood was but a silly show an it were not for the wine from the horses nostrilsthat had some sense in it my masters said cecco the folly was in not beheading the barons when he had them ail in the net and so messere baroncelii savs ah baroncelli is an honest man and follows no half measures it was a sort of treason to the people not to do so why but for that we should never hive inst so many tall fellows by the gate of san lorenzo true true it was a shanie  some say the barons bought him and then said another 4 those poorlords colonnaboy and man thev were the best of the family save the castello i vow i pitied them 44 4 but to the point said one of the crowd the richest of the set 4 the tar is the thinj the ingratitude to tax us let him dare do it   mi he will not dare for i hear that the popes bristles are up at last so he will only have us to depend upon  here is satire over which the most bigoted tory might gloat with rapture it is of no use saying that these men are merely degraded italians here they are not acting as italians but as sons of human nature it is from thc unchanging soul of man that the picture is drawn  the colouring is dismal but it is correct would the large and fashionable furnishing ironmonger of our metropolis act more heroically than the huge roman smith cecco del vcecilio mr bulwer knows he would not would the west end purveyor of meat the word butcher is obsolete be more ready than luigi to whet his knife in defence of a newlyacquired liberty  or is there a rich radical vestryman of marylebone who would behave more nobly than the richest of thc set of the roman crowd noa few hundred or it few thousand of years make but small change in the common impulses of humanity again we thank mr bulwer for this picture but the finishing stroke is still to be put to it the hundred and fifty mercenaries are in the heart of the city the tribune has just been excommunicated by the popes emissary llienzi harangues the roman populace in order to inflame them to arms to drive out this handful of robbers in his harangue he tells them that he will go and stand with his few attendants before thc holding of the barbarians that his trumpet shall sound three times and that if at the third blast they do not rise and hasten to his banner and to the attack he will abandon them to the fruits of their ingratitude and cowardice and to the tender mercies of the barons isle departs and then one of the demagogues in the crowd thus begins    look you my masters said he leaping up to the place of the lion  the tribune talks bravely he always did hut the monkey used the cat for his chesmits  he wants to thrust your paws into the fire  you will not be so silly as to let him the saints bless us  but the tribune good man gets a palace and his banquets and bathes in a porphyry vase the more shame on himin which san sylvester christened the emperor constantine all this is worth fighting for but you my masters what do you get except hard blows and a stare at a holiday spectacle  why then if you beat these fellows you will have another tax on the wine that will be your reward    hark cried cecco  there sounds the trumpeta pity he wanted to tax us 44  true cried baroncelli there sounds the trumpet a silver trumpet by the lord  next week if you help him out of this serape hell have a golden one but gowhy dont you move my friends  tis but one hundred and fifty mercenaries true they are devils to fight clad in armourfrom top to toe hut what thenif they do cut some four or five hundred throats youll heat them at last and the tribune will sup tin1 merrier 44  there goes the second blast said the butcher  if my old mother had not lost two of us already tis odds but id strike a blow for the bold tribune   you had better put more quicksilver in you continued baroncelli 4 or youll be too late and what a pity that will be if you believe the tribune he is the only man that can save rome what you the finest people in the worldyou not able to save yourselves you bound up with one manyou not able to dictate to the colonna and orsini why who heat the barons at san lorenzo was it not you ah  you got the buffets and the tribune the moneta  tush my friends let the man go  i warrant there are plenty as good as he to he bought a cheaper bargain andhark  there is the third blast it is too late now  44 as the trumpet from the distance sounded its long and melancholy note it was as the last warning of the parting genius of the place and when silence swallowed up the sound a gloom fell over the whole assembly they began to regret to repent when regret and repentance availed no more  the buffoonery of baroncelli became suddenly displeasing  and the orator had the mortification of seeing his audience disperse in all directions just as he was about to inform them what great things he himself could do in their behalf 44 meanwhile the tribune passing unscathed through the dangerous quarter of the enemy who dismayed at his approach shrunk within their fortress proceeded to the castle of st angelo whither nina had already preceded him  and which he entered to find that proud lady with a smile tor his safetywithout a tear for his reverse and this ends the first reign of the tribune many arc thc adventures that llienzi in his selfimposed exile undergoes and many and highlywrought and beautiful are the incidents that befall the other characters of this exciting story which even to glance at we have no space the eternal city after its tribunes departure becomes saturated with the blood of lier children  faction expels factionmassacre avenges massacretill heaven either in vengeance or in mercy in order to put a stop to the intercommunion of murder pours down the vials of her wrath and enacts the destroyer the plague in its inconceivable destructiveness hushes the voiles of all the contending factions in the nottobebroken silence of death in this part of the work the eloquence of mr bulwer often arises into sublimity but we wish not to be mere panegyrists let us hurry over a mass of events and a long period also when time is chronicled by actions the pope and his advisers find out that if rome is to be preserved to the church it can only be brought about by thc instrumentality of the banished and now imprisoned tribune his fetters are knocked offhe is relieved of the bann of his excommunication and clothed in the senatorial robe he goes again to govern rome adversity now seems to have perfected his character the same prosperity follows in his stepsthe barons are again humbled and rome if not again quiet is again happy ami now wc come to the bitterest commentary on democracy that was ever formed to open the eyes of a deluded world a tax is again necessary a revolt of the free and good citizens of home is the consequence we shall not adv crt to the byeplay introduced by mr bulwer in order to make his finale more dramatic the tribune advances to address the infuriated mob thus closes the eventful scene of the man who would te the friend of the mere people mark it is a liberalalmost a radical that describes it 44 then from earth to heaven rose the roar4 down with

leaders of the multitude trembled lest he should bc heard  4 and doubtless says the contemporaneous biographer 4 had he but spoken he would have hanged them all and the work been marred 44 the soldiers of the barons had already mixed themselves with the throngmore deadly weapons than stones aided the wrath of the multitudedarts and arrows darkened the air and now a voice was heard shrieking4 way for the torches heil in the sunlight they tossed and waved and danced to and fro above the heads of the crowd as if the fiends were let loose amongst the mob and what place in hell hath fiends like those a mad mob can furnish  straw and wood and litter were piled hastily round the great doors of the capitol and the smoke curled suddenly up beating back the rush of the assailants 44 hienzi was no longer visible au arrow had pierced his handthe right hand that supported the flag of homethe right hand that had given a constitution to the republic isle retired from the storm into the desolate hall isle sat down  and tears springing from no weak and woman source but tears from the loftiest fountain of emotiontears that befit a warrior when his own troops desert hima patriot

bursting flames the grey image reflected a lurid light and glowedthat grim and solemn monument as if itself of fire  44 there arrived the crowd gave way terrified by the greatness of their victim silent he stood and turned his face around  nor could the squalor of his garb nor the terror of the hour nor the proud grief of detection abate the majesty of his mien or reassure the courage of the

his first word was as the signal of his own death 44 4 pie tyrant cried ceeeo del vecchio and he plunged his dagger in the senators breast we said this was written by a liberal almost a radical wte unsay our words for the epithet now must be impossible the very assassin that struck this cowardly this ungrateful blow was the most upright of all the demoeraticafparty the moral is plain enoughany who run may read lu the hand that struck the blow mr bulwer is elucidating a principle not detailing a tact this stroke at democracy is gratuitous the smith is a fiction of story but an everlasting truth of principle mr bulwer despairs of the human raceand so do we for generations to come they were not formed for selfgovernment the majority should because as yet they are only fit for it influence not control nor cv cn elect their governors democratic liberty is the illusion of generous minds how then could mr bulwer have escaped it ourselves were cai ried away by it we have been miserably undeceived when reform was at first agitated and the bill promulgated we hoped great things tor the nationwc thought we saw a new light dawning upon mankind what now has the country gained by it what the world  the reins of government have passed into other hands but i hey are held the more tightly and the lash is applied the more incessantly in mere formin the babble of theory the commonwealth appears to be more free but actual oppression in every present tyranny gives proof to the contrary these are not words of mere declamation one half of the population at least cannot hold themselves secure of not being at some one time within the scope of the poor laws over the whole of these whig oppression grins horribly into how many circles have not the hateful commissioners of this government extended they have already destroyed all local corporations they are not a far distant and almost an abstract grievance that flourishes only near the person of a despot or in the hotbed of a court but it casts its withering shades over our very hearths but wc dare not trust ourselves to descant upon this very galling subject wc can only congratulate mr bulwer upon this highly elaborated and conservative production one that we trust will do as much good to mankind as it does honour to his refined subtle and powerful intellect as a literary composition it would justify any and even contradictory praises it is at times sweet and solemn severe and gay eloquent always poetical often it leads away the heart a willing captive while it appeals to the judgement with the force of logic and leaves upon us the conviction that we have been inspecting the leaves   brok the title of which should be 44 an eternal truth  rienzi the last of thc tribunes ey tin author of  eugene

now when we hilve abundant leisure and are only required to state the results of a deliberate judgment we do not find the difficulties much less perplexing to string together highsounding words and gay epithets is iir more easy than to praise xvith discrimination and understanding if xve have been chary of commendation and extreme in raising objections to some of mr bulwers former works we were mainly influenced by the high estimation in which we held his natural powers and endowments and ourproportionntc impatience of any blemish xvhieh should prevent their coming to full and perfect maturity now however the days of reservation arc over mr llulwer has cast off the egotism and the petulance which distinguished and marred his carly writings lt would seem as if the very air which breathes over lands of classic song and story bad allayed the fever of a spirit made sensitive and scornful perhaps by too close a communion with the narrow world around bini and leaving all its energy and poetry in their first freshness bad subdued its irritabilitywe hope for ever thus while we only regarded his earlier novels as indication1however superior to the mature productions of most menwe look upon his two lastupon the present one especiallyas complete and excellent we have indeed read llienzi with equal prideuud pleasurefor what further may we not expect from him who has already done so much to justify the diviner nature within him and in place of exhausting the stores of his mind with shortsighted thriftlessiiess appears to be increasing and enriching them every day by nev and precious acquisitions lt will not surprise ns however if the romance before us do not rise at once to the popularity of its predecessors it is too hightoned too exquisitely finished in its texture

B3891,"['8648846', '8699414']",  the professor at the breakfasttable  with the story of iris by oliver wendell holmes ticknor  fields london low  co prenticeana or wit and humour in paro graphs by the editor of the louisville journal new york derby  jackson london low  co miss martineau characterised american con versation as prosy rich and droll we i int have been reminded of her epithets by the i to professors welcome book dr holmes i holds a high place in the light literature of  america he is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists there is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what mrs j da pringle in gaits  ayrshire legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent with all this the story of iris approves dr holmes to be an american writerthe number of mysterious girls who figure in transatlantic fiction is appalling such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke  iris is j ei the una of the boardinghouse iu which the scene i  of this volume is laiddr holmes in an jl imaginary character describing himself as also j  a dweller in one of those household societies j  which so far as we can read the riddle imply  companionship without affinityintimacywith i 8 no real confidence besides the mystery of 18  iris  who keeps a book tight locked j b which contains some very pleasant verse as  g we shall show his boardinghouse contains t a more dismal curiositya deformed man  b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 eanions in the house yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the i  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  john the young man john asked me to come up one day and try some old burbon which lc he said was al on asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that i shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way i followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking i might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity mighty close quarters they were where the young man john bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  barnum presenting ossian e dodge to jenny lind and a picture of a famous trot in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions and especially the italicised word dan mace names b h major

the end of the statement do i look as if id lost much flesh  bid heanswering my question by another no aid ifor that matter i think you do credit to the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board the sentence in quotationmarks was from one of those dis interested editorials in small type which i suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landladys and paid for as an advertisement   it ant the feedsaid the young man johnits the old womans looks when a fellah lays it in too strong the feeds well enough after geese have got tough  turkeys have got strong v lambs got old n veals pretty nigh beef n sparragrasss growin tall n shm n scattery about the head n green peas are gettin so big n hard theyd be dangerous if you fired em out of a revolver we get hold of all them delicacies of the season but its too much like feedin on live folks and devourin widdahs substance to lay yourself out in the eatin way when a fellahs as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one n not enough for two i cant help lookin at the old woman cornedbeefdays shes tolerable calm roastindays she worries some n keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves but when theres anything in the poultry line it reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin into the breast and joints comin to pieces that theres no comfort in eatin when i cut up an old fowl and help the boarders i always feel as if i ought to say wont you have a slice of widdahinstead of chicken the young man john fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being a 1 under j the influence of the crackers and sausage he grew  cordial and communicative it was time i thought j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had i excited my curiosity what do you think of our young irisi

particular to her that i remember but1 dont know whether it was the cracker and sausage or that the young fellows feet were treading on the hot ashes 1 i of some longing that had not had time to cool b j but his eye glistened aa he stopped i suppose she s i wouldnt have looked at a fellah like mehe said t i but i come pretty near tryin if she had said  yes though i shouldnt have known what to do

for themexcept once a yearon fastday and marryin ant for them sometimes a fellah feels lonely and would like to have a nice young woman to tell her how lonely he feels and sometimes a fellah here the young man john looked very confidential and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies practice walking the more graceful they become in their movements those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one a graceful correctionthe proper study of mankind is womanpunch woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive a kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  a miss way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a kentucky lawyer in that city after which

him in her balloon brigham young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of utah are her women it is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources the last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers  the poet of the breakfast table saturday november 2 1872 literature by oliver wendell holmes routledge  sons we have had the autocrat and the professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour we cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded it would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the poet like the autocrat and professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly the breakfasttable series is now complete its fault is its extreme length the poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse if he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as pas trop de zele the poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue there are fourteen persons at the breakfast table the opposite ends are occupied by the landlady and the capitalist on one side are the poet the scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a man of letters a master of arts a young girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called scheherazade and the lady on the other side are dr b franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the astronomer the member of the haouse as the legislator calls himself the registrarof deeds the salesman and that boy the lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community he turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary in this company the poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures they are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries the poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match the following are among very numerous examples  it aint just the thing to grease your ex with the isle of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do again   it is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle cotton mather was miserable all his days i am afraid after that entry in his diary  this day dr sewele was chosen president for his piety1 we may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal americans believe that there are no hs in england and frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  however we could match the goodlooking landlady of the poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope the daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the order of things and who remarks  i hope to do some sound thinking in heavenif i ever get there  fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects the first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted they have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from heaven the groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem we approve of the old masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed i dont like your chopped music any way that woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesflorence nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowiez out isnt not that exactly but something like it i have been to hear some music pounding after describing the concert with much humour he adds i like to hear a woman sing and i like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me i know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and pop went a small piece of artillery    that boy was in his seat looking demure enough the master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which i saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our great organthat himalayan home of harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often there is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  i thank god that a great many people believe a great deal more than i do i think when it comes to serious matters i like those who believe more than i do better than those who believe less there is no doubt that this is a general feeling we endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   it is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it if he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone in quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the breakfast table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids the character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the young girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the weekly bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it the poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul she ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail i spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night the poet thinks the toiling scheherazade of the weekly bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers the sunworshippers daughter which she wrote for the bucket here is a sample  kiss mine eyelids beauteous morn blushing into life newborn  lend me violets for my hair and thy russet robe to wear and thy ring of rosiest hue set in drops of diamond dew  kiss my lips thou lord of light kips my lips a soft good night westward sinks thy golden car  leave me but the evening star and my solace that shall be borrowing all its light from thee  we may now rise from the breakfast table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at

which as she conceives women have an especial cause of  complaintthese are the legal tyranny of husbands and the difficulty for a woman to obtain  cheap and easy divorce this being the text i it is not difficult to imagine that the authoress  makes out a strong case of special pleading j mary lyndon the heroine is a strongminded womanmany many degrees above proof  she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment  a susceptible female but out of them all  she comes forth triumphantly an  emanci pated woman offering herself as an example  and a leader to her sex for our own part we  must confess that upon closing the book we had j come round to the verdict of the sagacious old1 ham jury on the trial of a man for killing his  j wife that he had served her right most   readers will we fancy feel unfeigned compas sion for mr albert hervey who for some sin  in a previous state of existence is sentenced to become the husband of mary lyndon the authoress is not without talent but she chokes i  all sympathy in her readers by the hard arro  gant dogmatical selfcomplacency with which   she puts herself forward the book is written   in the worst style of american bad tastefull   of pedantry and fine writing the story is one j that simply told and written in a better spirit p might have been made not only interesting but profitable for it touches upon many deeply  j interesting points in the secret and social life of women but as it stands it is only redeemed from being absurd by being detestable the heroine begins with her early childhood and goes through all the miseries that can beset a child for the purpose of shoving how ignorant foolish and bigoted were all the people placed in authority over her they treat her wrong they feed her wrongthey clothe her wrong they teach her wrongand she has to find herself in every thing in fact from her own account of herself she seems to have been sent into the world like a bottle of patent medicine labelled and attested to cure every imaginable female complaint social or physical dissatisfied with the religious teaching she receives from her parents she becomes a quaker and going to visit some quaker friends she receives an offer from a man to whom she conceives a violent antipathy at first sight and accepts him her account of the matter is that  his friends pleaded and besought her to marry him and m  a whirl of persuasions that literally made me dizzy i consentedmy time was well nigh come when fate met me in the path of life and i fell on my face and worshipped a young man such as i had seen in my daydreams was introduced to me by hervey i lovedand i awoke to the consciousness of living death the hours i spent with my friend whose sphere was a constant beneficence to me were whitewinged moments such as make our ideal of heaven my heart sprang to him as the flower lifts its petals to the warm sunlight in spite of this she keeps her engagement and marries herveyand  does her duty by him in a style that would make any husbands blood curdle in his veins at the prospect of what might have been his lot had the gods given him such a wife she of course as a pendant to her own portrait as a model wife and victim paints her husband in conjugal colours that rival the superfluous blackness of an illustrious personage who must not be named to ears

hard  and as they can produce no flowers they turn themselves into rods they cannot leave virtue and beauty at peace and they quarrel with beauty and weakness let us hope that by the light of a moro

love and a protecting home closed around them liken midsummer bower theil joys and their sorrows are alike innocent and all their intercourse with their fellow creatures is peaceful no one hates thom

extensively read little is known however of her personal history and it is to be regretted that her english translator has not taken the trouble to collect a few particulars concerning the life of an author who occupies so remarkable a position we believe miss bremer was born to affluence but troubles have fol leu heavily on her family and reduced her in the spring of life to a state of dependence upon her friends who move in the best circles of the capital her genius has thus been prompted to exertion by adversity and many touching allusions to her own circumstances may be found scattered through her productions she resides chiefly at stockholm the secret ot her success lies in that truthfulness f delineation which whatever form it takes or in v hat ever manner it makes itself manifest is always siru to strike home to the heart of a people she mes nothing to art and everything to the depth aud seriousness of a resolute purpose she is the least skilful ol all living novelists she has no notion of consiructiiii a narrative on anv inlelligie principle of arrangement she never dreams of  mhveiing a series tlincidents in natural sequence willi her the end arul aim of thc design is to work out thoronuhly and sincerely the whole passion of the subject h fore her without embarrassing her progress willi any reference to what has gone before or what is likely to follow how she succeeds in raising though edifice and finally roofing it must be a grave puzzle to the aesthetic critics of germany  for she may be fairly compared to an architect uho builds a house without scaffolding vet her looks arc nevertheless solid and symmetrical in relation to their ultimate object and like all truths lound in strong feelings and fixed conviction have an innate energy in them that overrules criticism her novels are not novels of plot or costume hut of character and observation lier knowledge of human nature is profoundol human nature as it is dewhmed in the world and acted upon by worldly influences she paints society with a wisdom rarely brought to bear upon domestic scenes and she unveils with such clearness and courage the mixed emotions that throb beneath the surface that the reader derives from the reality of hr pictures a sort of artificial experience of life the volumes before us contain two talcs or more properly a family chronicle divided into two parts the faults which were so prominent in miss brewers former publications are even more conspicuous in this the interest is broken up and distributed amongst a greit variety of persons the narrative is a progress through a succession of events rather than a compact story the individuals who move in it are strongly contrasted and some of them are drawn in sheer wilful excess  in the matter of plot there is a tendency to extravagance and romance which is strangely irreconcilable with the good sense and cultivated taste of the author  and if we add that there is too much german mysticism and too much of that socalled artenthusiasm which deals so largely in loose abstractions as to bc nearly unintelligible we shall have discharged our conscience of every grain of objection that has settled upon it during a careful perusal of these volumes but how large a balance of praise remains to oe counted up the minute fidelity of the details the vivid distinctness with which every mental struggle and secret emotion is traced the moral beauty and womanly purity which steadily illuminate thc narrative and thc calm christian philosophy out of which all its earnest lessons of truth anil justice and resignation and serene wisdom arc drawn must receive implicit admiration on all hands the style occasionally perhaps a little too florid is generally eloquent and appropriate and much as she crowds thc scene with figures miss bremer possesses beyond any other living writer of her cuss the power of realising to the imagination every individual she introduces there is scarcely a single person in her tumultuous groups that does not stand out palpably in his lning lineaments the presidents daughters occupies only the first volume nina the youngest of the family engrosses the remaining two the president is a widower with four daughters and we are introduced on the very threshold of the narrative to this fair household on whose fortunes the whole story revolves the narrator is the governess to whose charge the orphan are consigned  the first wat a tall thin figure with a remarkably plain countenance and stiff and unpleasing demeanour she curtseyed coldly and reservedly and was presented

in the meantime i paid attention to the president who was conversing with his two elder daughters adelaide related to her father the events of the daythe dinner company and the dishes edla added a remark or two and even sometimes upon her sisters words the president marvelled much at the mixture of  chicken and cauliflower for my part i could not take my eyes from adelaide she struck me as indescribably beautiful and pleasing her countenance was more round than oval the forehead high and finely arched the nose small and exquisitely formed whilst a pair of large dark blue eyes beamed with joy and goodheartedness and the roses of health tinged both her lips and her cheeks her smile nay her whole manner was such as we ascribe to a cherub she was ot middle height her figure finely moulded and her carnage noble  her neck her arms and hands dazzlingly white and of the most perfect form her head whichwas adorned with rich chesnutbrown hair she carried a little thrown back which gave her an appearance of haughtiness nay almost of arrogance  nor was this contradicted by her manner however softened that might be by an expression of sincere sweetness and goodwill beside this brilliant figure her sister showed like a shadow and i suspected that it was her own sense of this which made her so gloomy the foundations of the subsequent interest are visibly laid in these portraits kdla plain reserved and melancholy has no share in her fathers affections the worthy president is a man of conventions and without being conscious of an injustice is devotedly fond of the beautiful adelaide a morose spirit is gradually engendered in the heart of the neglected edla and from ont step to another the distance between her and lier father widens into distrust and aversion passing over a long interval let us come to the sequel it is evening the company juc assembled in the drawingroom and adelaide has just sung a song about  home the subject is a dangerous one 44  a home  said count w softly as he crossed his arms on his breast and bowed his head 4 a home with a beloved wifeit is in truth a heaven 444 yes said the president  and with an amiable daughter who in everything seeks to please her father and provides so tenderly for his comfort and enjoyment 44 the tone in which this was said and the sharp glance he cast upon edla caused ali eyes to turn upon her she coloured violently i am certain that the president immediately repented his hasty and unfriendly words  but what was said was said and edlas embittered feelings roe hastily to a decree which i should have thought with her to be impossible she turned to count alarik and said  44 4 you have compared home to a heaven do you know what else it may resemble  44 lie looked questioningly upon her and she continued 4 a house of correction 44 i shuddered at these bitter words the president started so that the tea was shaken out of his cup count alarik regarded kdla seriously and reproachfully 44 kdla continued with violent excitement  there is an overseer and there are prisoners the fonner assigns work to the latter and when they neglect it he punishes them he exacts the fulfilment of duties but gives neither the tenderness nor the joy which makes duty light but why complain of it v she added casting up a glance full of anger and despair  the lesser life is but a counterpart of the higher and home is an image of the worlds order 44 i miss kdla said count alarik warningly 44 the president was violently affected but restrained himself and turning to count alarik said with a specious calmness4 is it not wonderful my dear count that man so often embitters his own days and then complains impatiently at the suffering he has himself causer  my late  wife the president became moved as he almost always did when he named her  poor frederica made me  s the happiest of husbands  if she had lived she would like i  wise have made me a happy father for she would have  taught her daughters that mildness and concession which j alone can gain love she would have taught them to deserve   a fathers tenderness who desired nothing better than to see all his children happy around him and to clasp them a to his bosom i  the president was moved and evidently ready for reconciliation not so edla the long pentup poison of bitterness was boiling up in her 444 love alone she said  wins return of love that father who gave his child life and did not give it tenderness and does not give it joy has no right to make any claims no right said the president with warmth and too excited to be able to weigh his words  no right but vou you can never be wron you must always he right but it i have no right to claim from you some compliance and obedience i have at least a right to free myself and my house from discomfort and disquiet for the last three years you have not given me one single joyful day  you have yourself evidently shown that you despise your fathers counsel and dislike his house if in future this does not become other than it has been heretofore then it is best thatthat we part  it will then be my affair said edla coldly and growing pale to give place i shall soon no longer

and descriptive power there may not be the little touches of humour or the sly insights into nature of charles dickens there is not the childlike simplicity of andersen but there is surpassing energy and vitality it is a painful book to read but it is also impossible to do so without being benefited by the perusal mary barton a tab oat m chester life in 2 vols chapman and hall every scene is indeed a touch of nature almost sanctified by its wholesome truthfulness the meeting of the friends in  green heys fields the earnest selfwilled john barton the future chartist an intellect struggling against poverty and want of proper information george wilson a working man yet in his own way a philosopher and a philanthropist the two wives weeping and condoling for one poor sheep that has gone astray a pretty pert young maiden the heroine mary and her lover hardworking steady and  gallant jem wilson gallant 1 the reader will exclaim can a workman be gallant  yes read that most stirring scene of a fire in a factory in which jeni wilson saves so many lives at the peril of his own and gllantry will not be denied to rude coarse men akin to that of any knights most glorious deeds a teaparty of the poor pleasantly sketched is followed by a scene full of pathos the sudden death of mrs barton one of the ties which bound john barton to the gentle humanities of earth being thus loosened he became more obstinate in his aversion to the rich and his gloom and his sternness became habitual the authoress professes to have nothing to do with political economy or the theories of trade she says that she merely wishes to impress what the workman feels and thinks but she allows the discontented to murmur in prolonged strains without an attempt to chasten the heart or to correct the understanding barton rails at all capitalists as being so only through the toil of the poor this would be staunch communism there surely must be capitalists or the condition of the poor would be worse than ever we are told in scripture that the poor shall never cease out of the land but we are also told that their expectation shall not perish and that those who trust shall be fed and be delivered out of affliction further than this we are told that the person of the poor should no more be respected than that of the rich should be honoured and while it is sinful to oppress and a duty to assist so also to the poor that will not hear rebuke their poverty is their destruction while the father gets more and more involved in chartist plots mary engages herself as an apprentice to a milliner in a little street leading off ardwick green and where she is seen and admired by harry carson son of the opulent millowner the interest of the rivalry of the workingengineer and the young gentleman is however for a time absorbed by passing scenes descriptive of the sore afflictions of the poor the cellar to which barton and wilson repair to carry comfort to a starving familythree or four little children rolling on the damp nay wet brick floor through which the stagnant filthy moisture of the street oozed up the fireplace empty and black the husband dying of typhus the wife crying in the dark loneliness of the dying man s lair is appalling in its horrors these poor people have strange superstitions too in the midst of their trying afflictions wilson carried home the typhus to his own home and two children fell victinms to the infection one is already gone 1 is there any chance for the other one think you  inquired mary who had come upon a samaritan errand of rather rare occurrence since she had now the affections of a young gentleman alice shook her head and told with a look that she believed there was none she next endeavoured to lift the little body and carry it to its oldaccuistomed bed in its parents room but earnest as the father was in watching the yetliving he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up mid took his deadamumbl

dyling soul go free so it has a hard struggle for the quiet of death we mun get him away fra his mother or hell have a hard death poor lile fellowr so without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking child but the mother would not let him go and looking in alices face with brimming and imploring eyes declared in earnest whispers that she was not wishing him that she would fain have him released from his suffering alice and mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child whose struggles seemed to increase till at last his mother said with a choking voice  may happen yod better take him alice i believe my hearts wishing hiim a this while for i cannot no i cannot bring mysel to let my two childer go in one day i cannot help longing to keep him and yet he shanot suffer longer for me she bent down and fondly oh with what passionate fondness kissed her child and then gave him up to alice who took him with tender care natures stnrggles were soon exhausted and he breathed his little life away in peace mary in the pride of her new conquest discards the young engineer and refuse his offer of marriage only to repent a moment after and that so bitterly that she follows up one refusal by another and loses both lovers at the same time she is the more confirmed in her resolve in respect to henry carson as he intimated that his intentions had not at first been of an honourable character the pith of the story hangs upon the events which follow upon the dismissal of the two lovers the fallen esther warns jem wilson that a fate similar to hers awaits mary and in an attempt to prevent this the workman assaults his young master not long after this john barton worked up to madness by his false notions of the relation of master and workman shoots henry carson with jem wilsons gun the young engineer is tried and only saved by an alibi the manner in which mary barton declares her preference for the prisoner then at the bar is a most effective scene the old man acknowledges his guilt to the father of young carson who at first full of revenge is at the conclusion made to feel that those who are strong in gods gifts are meant to help the weak and that a perfect understanding and complete confidence aud love may exist between masters and men the interests of the one being the interests of all,biography
B2562,"['9027810', '6653685']",  the legend of jubal and other poems saturday may 16 7874 literature george eliot s poems by george eliot blackwood  sons there are certain developments of the genius of george eliot for which verse is the only satisfactory medium artistic longings and fancies such as abound in romola and  middlemarch can scarcely find adequate expression in prose in the march of verse and in the effect of recurrent sounds there is something which aids as much the writer in the development of his thought as the reader in its appreciation or retention not seldom the continued labour of the author imparts to his work a grace and a significance beyond his expectation that come upon him almost as a surprise and a revelation where no such result is obtained there is a pleasure in the task of polishing to the utmost poetic utterances which combines the glad service of the worshipper with the mothers delight in attendance upon her offspring since the success of the spanish gypsy bas shown that verse in the hands of george eliot is a serviceable and manageable instrument there is little cause to wonder it is again adopted the poems in the volume now published deal with that aspiration which takes in different natures the form of music devotion love for such themes poetry is the fittest medium in welcoming george eliot once more as a poet however and in expressing sympathy and admiration for her present production we are far from implying that we should like to see a large portion of her effort directed to verse her case is analogous to that of scott no one will now contest the value of scotts ballad romances while however in his own days scott had in poetry rivals and superiors in prose fiction his supremacy was unchallenged in like manner the appearance of a poem from george eliot is a matter of interest while that of a novel is an affair of highest literary importance the four principal poems in the volume have already appeared in print in various magazines english and american all have a measure of resemblance in the lesson they enforce in the legend of jubal and in armgart aspiration developes itself through music in agatha it finds its utterance in a life of devotion and in  how lisa loved the king it blossoms into love after his departure from the presence of his offended god cain built a city in which his offspring dwelt unaware of the curse of death that was upon them idly they laboured as a maid who weaves her hair ia mimic mats and pauses oft aud strokes across her hand her tresses soft then peeps to watch the poised butterfly or little burdened ants that homeward hie time was but leisure to their lingering thought there was no need for haste to finish aught accident first revealed the presence in their midst of the grim spectre of death and a change came over the scene each man feeling the insecurity of his tenure now that death was lord of life strove to snatch te passing hour and work grew eager and device was born chief workers among those stung into activity were the sons of lamech in whose family death had made first inroad jabal the eldest son learned to tame the lowing kine to nurse the starbrowed calves and soothe the silly sheep tubal yoked the fire and made it roar in prisoned servitude within the furnace till with force subdued it changed all forms he willed to work upon meanwhile listening to the clanging symphonies of the beaten and resonant metal jubal heard some melody wherein dumb longings inward speech bad found long he brooded over the sweet and mingled sounds the fluctuant changes of the spoken word  the mothers call the childrens answering cry the laughs light cataract tumbling from on high the suasive repetitions jabal taught that timid browsing cattle homeward brought the clearwinged fugue of echoes vanishing and through them all the hammers rhythmic ring the result of his meditations was the birth of the lyre alone among the hills he practised until his hand obtained a mastery over the chords at length one holidaytide he ventured to prove before his companions his new gift absorbed at first in this unexpected response to the  strange thirst within them  the fateful growth the unnamed discontent the listeners sat in silence until the twin sister of music sprang into being the youths and maidens both alike longtressed by graceinspiring melody possessed rose in slow dance with beauteous floating swerve of limbs and hair and many a melting curve of ringed feet swayed by each closelinked palm  then jubal poured more rapture in his psalm the dance fired music music fired the dance the glow diffusive lit each countenance till all the circling tribe arose and stood with glad yet awful bhock of that mysterious good subsequently jubal having taught to others his newfound art travelled to where eastward the hills touch heaven and remained away until most of those who had known him were dead he returned to find cities where he had left pastoral valleys memory of the benefits he had bestowed survived however and the people on the day even of his return were holding a feast in his honour when the weary greyhaired wanderer claimed to be the jubal whom they worshipped the minstrels rose and beat him with their flutes for irreverence and he who had given mankind its most priceless boon sought the  screen of thorny thickets where alone and untended he died cheered only by visions of song the close of this striking amplification of the suggestion thrown out in genesis resembles closely the notion german in origin we believe upon which mr wills founded his  man of airlie agatha depicts the grave placid and beneficent existence of a woman halfgrandame and half saint repaying by prayers the assistance she obtains from the villagers among whom she dwells prayer to her is a  way of singing just as the nightingales pour forth sad songs not too sure is agatha that her intercessions are of much avail nay i cannot sing  my voice is hoarse and oft i think my prayers are foolish feeble things  for christ is good whether i pray or notthe virgins heart is kinder far than mine  and then i stop and feel i can do nought towards helping men her simple life sanctified wholly to the service of her faith and her warm and gentle creed that  would have young things merry are touchingly depicted armgart is a dramatic sketch showing the dominion of the artistic passion over the breast of the singer who can hold thousands spellbound by her song aud the defeat and collapse which follow when after a brief period of triumph the voice gives way and the priceless instrument is worthless just as devotion in agatha and the sound of the lyre in  jubal suffice for all expression of emotion the voice of armgart is adequate to all utterance  poor wretch she says of any murderess  the world was cruel and she could not sing i carry my revenges in my throat i love in singing and am loved again the fretfulnesses vanities and anxieties of the artistic temperament have seldom been depicted more forcibly than in this poem they are subjugated however by the absolute  possession which armgarts art exercises over her nature her reasons for rejecting the suit of graf dornberg are well given and the study of artistic fervour and feminine wilfulness is fine as it can be armgarts address to the doctor whose drugs while curing her illness of throat have ruined her voice is thoroughly impassioned yes thick thick thick  and you have murdered it t murdered my voicepoisond the soul in me and kept me living you never told me that your cruel cures were clogging filmsa mouldy deadening blight a lavamud to crust and bury rae yet hold me living in a deep deep tomb crying unheard for ever o your cures are devils triumphs  you can rob maim slay and keep a hell on the other side your cure where you can see your victim quivering between the teeth of torture c the lesson of patience armgart learns at length from the resignation of her musicmaster an old composer whose philosophical calm stands in effective contrast with the tumultuous effervescence of youth  how lisa loved the king catches happily the spirit and something of the note of provencal song it transports the reader to a court like that of king rene and to a world to which the golden age is restored where arcadian dreams are realized and where all pleasures are permissible since all desire is virtuous what song is to armgart music to jubal and devotion to agatha love is to lisa and the manner in which utterance is given to her aspiration is very fanciful and delicate of the new poems in the book  a minor prophet is our favourite here george eliot is on her own territory of humour nothing can be cleverer than the opening description nothing deeper more subtle more sympathetic and more significant than the application the poem commences i have a friend a vegetarian beer by name elias baptist butterworth a harmless bland disinterested man whose ancestors in cromwells day believed the second advent certain in five years but when king charles the second came instead revised their date and sought another world i meannot heaven butamerica a fervid stock whose generous hope embraced the fortunes of mankind not stopping short at rise of leather or the fall of gold nor listening to the voices of the time as housewives listen to a cackling hen with wonder whether she has laid her egg on their own nestegg still they did insist somewhat too wearisomely on though joys of their millennium when coats and hats would all be of one pattern books and songs ah flt for sundays and the casual talk as good as sermons preached extempore equally admirable is the description of elias in whom ancestral zeal is modified by  transatlantic air and modern thought with hair brushed back to show his great capacity a full grains length at the anglo of the brow proving him witty while the shallower men only seem witty in their repartees not that hes vain but that his doctrine needs the testimony of his frontal lobe the millennium of elias will be reached when men are all vegetarian and practical science and civilization will bring about the day when  dogs will all be moral and all  the uglier breeds will fade from memory when wartpigs with tender and parental grunts wombats much flattened as to their contour perhaps from too much crushing in the ark but taking meekly that fatality  the serious cranes unstung by ridicule  longheaded shortlegged solemnlooking curs wise silent critics of a flippant age the silly straddling foals the weakbrained geese hissing fallaciously at sound of wheels all these rude products will have disappeared along with every faulty human type by dint of diet vegetarian all will be harmony of hue and line bodies and minds all perfect limbs wellturned and talk quite free from aught erroneous sadly our author thinks of the consequences of such a state of affairs endowed with that sympathy and pity for error and that respect for failure which are the rarest most unmistakable and least regarded attributes of the highest genius she falls into a strain of regret for those who living in those perfect times will not know half the dear imperfect things that move my smiles and tearswill never know the fine old incongruities that raise my friendly laugh the innocent conceits that like a needless eyeglass or black patch give those who wear them harmless happiness the twists and cracks in our poor earthenware that touch me to more couscious fellowship i am not myself the finest parian with my coevals a noble moral indicated iu the line our finest hope is finest memory comes as the close of a poem which by its gentle teaching its fine sympathy and its sad irony moves

a little like the laureates poem of circumstance ariongives finely the legend told by herodotus the volume in all poetic respects is an advance upon the  spanish gypsy in those qualities which without being indispensable to poetry supplement and elevate it in largeheartednessjtenderness and humour it is worthy of the author of  the mill on the floss it cannot fail to advance its authors reputation bringing her nearer our sympathies as well as placing her higher in our admiration  literature the legend of jbal and other poemis by i georgeeliot london blackwood sons it is always instructive when a great painter turns sculptor or a great musician turns dramatist or a great poet turns novelist or as in the present case a great novelist turns poet there is always something fresh to be learned about the powers and the im pulses of the artist which have to find a fresh channel for themselves there is always something to be learned also about the limits of the old channels which no longer seem enough this is so especially in the case of such a personal spontaneous genius as george eliot all whose writings are necessary to the complete expression of herself with whom we are entirely safe from mere echoes of other writers which express nothing except an overambitious sympathy even shortcomings have their meaning and their interest when they are visibly due not to any defect of training or elaboration but to the habitual predominance of other faculties than those which are most helpful to the work in hand a great thinker cannot wait while fancy and emotion grow up into thought the thought must always be there and sometimes the fancy and emotion grow over the thought luxuriantly and sometimes though the overgrowth is always healthy the thought shows through in the spanish gypsy there was a constant incongruity the whole conception was poetical and verse was obviously the only appropriate vehicle for the most dramatic movements of the story but there were long intervals where the action flagged or was positively pushed aside by commentaries and dikcassions or was overlaid by ornament and it was hardly a compensation that the commentaries were an overflow of intellec tual sympathy with the situation and that the ornaments showed how much diligent and refined observation had fed the writers imagination of the scenery the present volume is on a smaller scale than the spanish gypsy or most of the authors works in prose and it contains at least one poem the eleven sonnets entitled  brother and sister which is all but perfectmore delightful if possible more classical than the parallel passages in the mill o0 tvw floss in the novel there is no doubt more human more concrete individual reality but in the poem we gain what is even more precious an unbroken ideal medium in which what is harsh and grotesqcue is wholly suppressed in order that what is permanent and beautiful and memorable may appear unalloyed nearly every sonnet contains gems like thesei held him wise and when lie talked to me of snakes and birds and which god loved the best i thought his knowldgo marked the boundary where men grew iixad though angels knew the rest  all at home were told the wondrous feat and how the little sister had fished well in secret though my fortune tasted sweet i wondered why this happiness befell  the little lass had luck the gardener said and so i learned luck was with glory wed his years with others must the sweeter be for those brief days he spent in loving me if the  brother and sister  show the superiority of verse over prose for presenting a subject sub specie aeternitatis  armgart  shows the superiority of the same instrument for expressing the fullness of passion which the growing reticence of modern civilisation tends to repress till it is probable that it will ultimately be extinguished like a fire deprived of air bear witness i am ealm i road my lot as soberly as if it were a tale writ by a creeping feuilletonist and called  the womans lot a tale of everyday a middling womans to impress the world with high superfluousness her thoughts a crop of chickweed errors or of potherb facts smiled at like some childs drawing on a slate  genteel 0 yes gives lessons not so good as any mans would be but cheaper far  pretty  no yet she makes a figure fit for good society poor thing she sews both late and early turns and alters all to suit the changing mode some wilower mlight do well marrying her but in these days  well she can somewhat eke her narrow gains by writing just to furnish her with gloves and droschlkies in the rain they print her things often for charityo a dogs life a harnessed dogs that draws a little cart voted a nuisance  it is impossible to write with more severity and compression of style and yet the effusion of feeling would have been excessive in prose again the verse certainly adds lightness and elevation to the bitter gaiety of leos answer when asked whether he expects his music to live when he is deadpfui the time was i drank that homebrewed wine and found it heady while my blood was young now it scarce warms me tipple it as i may i am sober still and say  my old friend leo much grain is wasted in the world and rots why not thy handful  on the other hand the description of armgarts reception by the house rather convinces us of the insufficiency of prose than of the sufficiency of verse and there are passages like the invention of butter in  jubal where what would have been easy and familiar in prose becomes strange without becoming beautiful inverse and in a minor prophet  there is a puzzling allusion to  astral cocoanuts which exemplifies a rather common fault of subtle and reflective poetry the writer sees that many things must always be left to the reader to comprehend at half a word and it is only in popular poetry that a traditional understanding exists to determine which of course the only reason for speaking of such things is that they intrude themselves on the attention less when they have been noticed and explained it is a pleasanter and more profitable study to compare how lisa loved the kino with its original in boccaccio and see how the modern writer has enlarged and deepened the meaning of the story without impairing its essential simplicity boccaccio keeps throughout to the tone of mere kindly courtesy with which wellbred people tell a graceful interesting story he does not dwell for a moment on the historical position of king pedro though the story is a ghibelline reply to a story of the temperance of king charles whom pedro dispossessed nor on the growth of lisas passion nor upon the spirit in which she accepted her happiness what might have been seen and heard is enough for him and out of this he makes one of the best of his prose idylls and in all that he says with one exception george eliot follows him closely the justification of and the originality of her poem is the wealth of brooding feeling which is poured into the space which boc caccio has left blank tue central point both of the story and of the poem may bo said to lie in the song which tells pedro the talc of lisas hopeless love boccaccio is deliciously sweet and musical and genuine but he does not get beyond the shy broken sob of animal feeling and innocent helpless pain the singer feels the pathos of this side of the situation too much to care to in tellectualise it the approaching death of the lovelorn maiden simply measures the ardour of her hopeless passion whereas in george eliot the worship of death be comes the keynote of four lovely stan zas of which the last is the clirqaxtell him 0 love i am a lowly maid mo nore than any little knot of thyme that lho with careless foot may often tread yet lowliest fragrance oft will mount sublime and cleave to things most high and hallowz1 as doth the fragrance of my lifes springtime my lowly love that soaring seeks to climb within his thought and makei a gentle bliss more

numbers of the e arthly paradise and the impression is all the stronger because the music of though answer is so often like an echo of the music of the challenge in both the dis cussion is carried on as it ought to be rather in accordance with the logic of feeling than the logic of signs mr morriss contention is that it is precisely when life is at its best that the thought of death poison it george eliot maintains with feuerbachs that it is death at a distance which gives life all its value and death at hand which puts the seal upon life when jubal returns in old age and finds his memory worshippedall was forgotten but the burning need to claim his fuller self to clhihn the deed that lived away from him and grew apart while he as from a tomb with lonely heart warmed by no meeting gla nee no hand that presse lay chill amid the life his life had blessed what though his song should spread from mans small race out through the myriad worlds that people space and make the heavens one joydiffusing choir  still mid that vast would throb the keen desire of this poor aged flesh this eventide this twilight soon in darkness to subside this little pulse of self that having glowed through thrice three centuries and divinely strowed the light of music through the vague of sound ached smallness still in good that had no bound after his rejection the solution isyea art thou come again to

were tones that with though vision blent he know not if that gaze the music sent or music that calm gaze to hear to see was but one undivided ecstasy the raptured senses melted into one and parting

dead bride who blessed thy lot above all mens beside  thy bride whom thou wouldst never chang nor take any bride living for that dead oes sakeo of course if any one were foolish enough to attempt to translate this into the logic of signs he would expose himself to the obvious observation that it is no more in our power to possess ourselves of our whole past than o the whole future of our work and that therefore it is idle to teach that we ought to be content to have our past for ourselves and give up our work to the world seriously if we are to expect either for ourselves we have an equal right to expect both from the liberality of a power able to do aiundantly above all that we can ask or think the fact is that there are problems presented by the permanent facts of the world which can only receive an objective solution if at all from paramount facts which show that the best which we can apprehend in the little that we know is supreme in the much which we do not know in this life but whatever objective solution we adopt or whether we despair of any we need a subjective solution for the subjective pro blem presented by the alternations of our own moods such a solution has never been given more worthily than in jubal and in the glorious lines beginning 0 may i join the choir invisible which form the epilogue of the volume and make the posi twist heaven for the first time intelligible and desirable because for the first time the conception has been lifted above the level of controversy from which it suffers even more than the majority of religious conceptions since there are few which are so open to be taunted with unanswerable questions indeed the whole volume is a splendid homage to the great principle of the inherent supremacy of feeling over thought which it is one of comtes chief merits to have formulated though be shrank from its legitimate consequences which is not surprising when we remember whence he took it and this gives an artistic value and completeness to the poetry of george eliot which is missing in some measure in her prose works though the latter are richer and more varied and more masterly the writer seems constantly trying to escape into the atmosphere of high impulse and momentary feeling in which the poems move habitually the love of lisa is an exquisite satisfaction to the perilous and invincible desire with dream fruit dream wishes to fulfil throughout  armgart her singleminded impetuosity is contrasted with the essential unexceptionable baseness of the count so as to show how ruinous it is simply to be consistently reasonable in matters of conduct  and by what is what will be to define aringarts impulsiveness is il fact the key to the whole poem she aggravates her loss by her eagerness to measure it and the particular form of her resignation is very much a matter of accident it would have been easy to find practical and ideal reasons if they were the thing required to show that her talent as an actress was too good to be wasted and that it would be foolish to destroy the chance of her voice recovering itself by teaching it would have been equally easy to prove that her tardy sym pathy for walpurga and leo it is an ad mirable trait that walpurga accuses her while she accuses herself to leo wvas a motive for generalisinc her revolt not for subsiding into submission but the poet resists the temltation to a systematic intel lectual pessimism as she resists the temptation to a systematic intellectual opti mism which would have made the moral change in armgart a compensation for the loss of her voice the only approach to a glorification of right reason is the very interesting poem on stradivarius who defends his simple straightforward perfect work triumphantly against a painter naldo knowing all tricks of style at thirtyone and weary of them  who tells stradivariuss thou nrt little more than a deft potters wheel antonio turning out work by more necessity and lack of varied function higher arts subsist on freedomeccentricityuncounted inspirations influenco that conies with drinking gambling talk turned wild then moody misery and lack of foodwith every dithyrumbic fine excess only when we remember that southey worked and prepared himself for work on the principle of stradivarius and that hoff mann and byron prepared themselves for work on the principles of naldo and compare the value of their work we see how hard it is to draw universal inferences from the best selected facts no one would be less disconcerted by this difficulty than the author who combines the most resolute and exalted hope with a keen perception of the ridiculous nature of all utopias which are a premature attempt to anticipate in detail the realisation of aspirations which it is well to cherish not even the conclave at the rainbow shows a sharper sense of humour than the minor prophet an american vegetarian and spiritualist who holdsthat thought was rapping in the hoary past and might have edified the greeks by raps at the greater dionysia if their ears had not been filled with sophoclean verse and when all earth is vegetarianwhen lacking butchers quadrupeds die out and less

B7819,"['8643129', '6167269']",  the ministers wooing by h beecher stowe a low  co 11 in this novel the leading events of which the p preface informs us are  founded on actual j p facts and the principal characters of which are historic mrs stow endeavours to depict the mannera and austere religious life of new england at the close of the last century she especially commends her work to the kindly  1 thoughts of the british firesidea compliment j c which we predict the british public will repay 11 by asking for the story at the circulating libra  s ries and in due course coming to the conclusion j that notwithstanding numerous blemishes which go a long way towards counterbalancing its i merits it is a tale to be read and for nine days  to be talked about the critical few will find amusement in comparing an american ladys description of the transatlantic puritanism to which whitfield imparted fresh earnestness more than a hundred years ago with the light satiric view taken of the same subject by mr thackeray in  the virginians the ministers wooing is a love tale a religious novel and an historicor rather biographicfiction all in one regarded as the first it deserves almost unqualified praise judged of as the second it merits a certain amount of blame but viewed as an illustration of history it is open to very grave censure the opening chapters as we indicated last december induce the reader to hope he is going to be treated with a series of simple domestic episodes although his feelings are early harrowed with an enumeration of the horrors of the slave trade but unfortunately these expectations are to a certain extent disappointed and the whole question of negro emancipation is dragged up for rediscussion in this the author has acted very unwisely with all its misstatements and onesidedness exaggeration and reticence uncle toms cabin was a powerful story and created a memorable sensation  equal perhaps to that caused amongst educated english people almost two hundred years before by afra behns oroonoko the first  nigger novel of our literature mrs stow would have decided well for her fame if imitating the caution of hamilton with his famous speech she had allowed this bril liant success to remain in solitary splendour and had not lessened its effect by endeavouring to repeat it the reception that  dred met with in this country must have convinced her that her english admirers were weary of listening to the cracking of legrees whip and that their craving for imagined woes must for some time to come be gratified with more refined sorrows than the tortures of slavemarkets and plantations down south very likely mrs stow is well aware of all this for the tone of her arguments against slavery in the present work is milk and honey in comparison with the scalding indignation of the story that first brought her into notoriety there is a wide difference between the inspired angel of abolition who penned  uncle toms cabin and the calm argumentative lady who in  the ministers wooing is content with coldly enunciating the moral obligation of all men to help the oppressed and this change can only be accounted for on the supposition that either she has so far outlived the ardour of her earlier impressions that what a few years since would have been the language of fervid poetry is now nothing more than a mere habit of sermonizing or else that accurately appreciating the state of public feeling she only breathes gently on the embers of a dying enthusiasm well knowing that a stronger current of air would altogether extinguish the feeble sparks that still linger in them the scheme of that part of the story on which the rest of the narrative is hung is simple and pretty enough the drama opens with a teaparty in the parlour of the widow scudder who is a lady blessed with a small farm and  a gambrelroofed cottage on the outskirts of newport a charming daughter the heroine a sweet little maiden just emerging from chudj hoodand a high reputation for the possession j of  faculty the precise meaning of which term  may be found in the athenmtm for december  25 1858 j the principal inmate of the widow scudders house is dr h the minister who does the wooing a divine of extreme calvinistic j opinions of pure life and of a gentle nature  a man dwelling in a world of spiritual abstraci tions guileless and simpleminded as a child  austere in his habits and of inflexible firmness of principle studious and abstracted he is a kind of coleridge divested of poetic faculty and imbued with moral stability the good man is a bachelor something over forty years of age and besides officiating zealously amongst j his congregation ministering to his afflicted j black brethren and writing a profound system i of divinity finds time to act to the fair mary scudder his landladys daughter the part that abelard did to heloise he is her tutor in religious and secular studies and she in return instructs him in the art of loving but unlike heloise of old mary only conceives for him that reverential affection which a young maiden naturally entertains for her pastor who appears to her an the expression of all the goodness that is possible in humanity the widow scudder would gladly see her daughter love the pastor dearly enough to wish to be his wife  but the meek gentle child wilful in one thing only bestows her heart on a wicked scapegrace of a cousin james marvyn who having run 31 away from home and been to sea returns from 3 foreign countries to laugh at the sanctimonious ways of the godly people of newport and to question the doctrine of election and predestination the young man of course is condemned by the surrounding respectability as r utterly reprobate and poor little mary is con tinually being informed that her cousin her playmate from infancy her dearest cousin is doomed to eternal perdition the child has also amongst other tenets of that religion which calvinism grafted on the stern nature of the puritan colonists called into existence has been taught that it is her duty to contemplate the idea of her own eternal punishment with lively pleasure if by such suffering the happiness of mankind at large could be increased naturally she applies this terrible doctrine to the state of her own mind in relation to her cousin until she feels she could willingly surrender herself a sacrifice to neverending torment in order to secure him admission to an eternity of bliss one afternoon james has a stolen interview with her to say farewell as next day he is about to start on a long voyage after much earnest and pathetic conversation on religion which we extracted when noticing the first number of this work james gives her a parting kiss and once more goes off to sea the voyage is one of disaster the ship is wrecked and news comes home that tames marvyn is drowned the intelligence well nigh kills poor little mary and for many a day she seems going the downward way to death her mother who has become possessed of her darlings secret watches her narrowly anxiously and prayerfully but mary does not die her physical strength is gradually restored to her and though her heart is saddened for life she prepares like the noble selfsacrificing girl she is to forget her own woes as much as possible and to devote her life to making others happy time passes on and dr h wno has comforted her in her sorrow and sickness ignorant of the nature of the wound her affections have suffered begs her to be his wife to gratify her mother to make a good man happy and to secure to herself a field of usefulness mary accepts him the wedding clothes are provided and the day for her marriage is fixedav the day is not a week distant on which january and may are to be united togetherand mary is training herself to look cheerfully on her future as the bride of the good and venerable dr h when one fine morning aa she walks in solitary meditation in the fields a voice is heard behind her and a quick step beats the ground and an arm is put round her waist and she falls fainting in her true lovers arms instead of being drowned james marvyn has returned home rich the rest of all this pretty romance can be imagined mary acknowledges to james that he has her heart but she is nevertheless determined to keep her promiseher solemn engagement to good dr h and bids her lover not to hinder her from doing her duty there is a pause of uncertainty and suspense the awful day draws nearer but ere it has arrived a jolly little dressmaker miss prissy who acts the part of an amiable sprite all through the play informs the doctor of the state of the case the finehearted man takes all the sorrow of the position to himself surrenders the timid child he loves so dearly to the man of her choice and sets his face resolutely forward to do his duty in that unwedded life which it seems providence has designed for him  you all know he said turning to mary who sat very near him  the near and dear relation in which i have been expecting to stand towards this friend i should not have been worthy of that relation if i had not felt in my heart the true love of a husband as set forth in the new testament who should love his wife even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it and if in case any peril or danger threatened this dear girl and i could not give myself for her i had never been worthy the honour she has done me for i take it wherever there is a cross or a burden to be born by one or the other that the man who is biade in the image of god as to strength and endurance should take it upon himself and not lay it upon her that is weaker for he is therefore strong not that he may tyrannise over the weak but bear their burdens for them even as christ for his church i have just discovered he added looking kindly upon mary  that there is a great cross and burden which must come either on thia dear child or on myself through no fault of either of us but through gods good providence and therefore let me bear it mary my dear child i will be to thee as a father but i will not force thy heart this is touching and well told but how does it all square with the facts on which the story ia founded who is this good dr h this pattern minister so forgetful of himself where the happiness of others is concerned who subsequent to the declaration of independence is represented as forty years of age childless and unwived  he is no other than the celebrated samuel hopkins dd pastor of the first congregational church in newport and cofounder with jonathan edwards of that awful that indescribably ferocious system of calvinistic theology known as the hopkintonian or hopkinsian but unfortunately for the truthfulness of mrs stowes tale samuel hopkins was born in the year 1721 and did not settle in newport till the year 1770 consequently instead of being forty at the outset of his wooing which commences after the recognition of american independence by england he must be regarded as more than sixty years old but further dr hopkins married in 1748 joanna ingersol who presented him with eight children and livea with him as his wife till her death on the last day of august in 1793 and on the 14th of september 1794 the doctor then in his seventyfourth year married again taking for his second wife miss elizabeth west a lady only sixteen or seventeen years younger than himself it is a matter of certainty that samuel hopkins was in no respect such a man as mrs stow has depicted him it is true that he was an abolitionist and published in 1776 a dialogue concerning the slavery of the africans but instead of being a shiftless dreamer incapable of looking after his worldly interests and wanting a religious landlady to rouse him up and tell nim when he was hungry he was a keen and energetic man and as well able to make a bargain as any other citizen of the united states although he owned a farm and made considerable sums by his literary productions he threatened to quit his congregation at newport if they could not provide comfortably for him and mrs stow can scarcely be ignorant of how active he was in organising prayermeetings amongst his flock such misrepresentations as these altogether overstep the limits which ought to restrain the imagination of a writer of historic fiction in such composition it is allowable to exercise the imagination in amplifying and giving colour to the views of history by the creation of any series of positions and incidents which are in accordance with recorded facts but surely a too daring disregard of veracity is exhibited by though writer who professes to sketch the life of an eminent person and at the same time misrepresents it in the most important particulars what object can mrs stow have in saying that her story is founded on facts when the masterincident of the book is pure fiction are the facts of uncle toms cabin of a similar kind  other historical characters besides dr hopkins are brought on the stage but not with greater felicity col aaron burr figures away with madame de frontignac deluging that lady and all the rest of the fair sex whom he addresses with very awkward adulation but this is a slight fault and one easily accounted for doubtless it has been mrs stowes pro vince throughout life to receive rather than to pay compliments we cannot discuss at length the religious side of this novel in that respect it forms a striking contrast to the tales of miss sewell being marked by a boldness of speculation and language which one would in vain look for in the writings of our own countrywomen it is we are willing to believe written in a devout and reverential spirit but it is to be regretted that one of the saddest exhibitions of the perverseness of the human intellect when directed to the contemplation of sacred mysteries should have been dragged into a pretty love story to disfigure ana even to mar it the eicture of mrs marvyns agony on hearing of er sons death and her despair of his salvation is as revolting a spectacle of spiritual buffering as uncle tom dying under the whips of his persecutors was of bodily torture if the hook should become popular its success will be won not by its polemical qualities but by the winning graces of the heroine and her little friend of the great world verginie in the construction and elaboration of marys character genuine artistic power is manifested in conception it lacks originality for in many respects she is a combination of longfellows evangeline and that form of youngladyism which has for some years been fashionable in american novels and many features of her mind and incidents of her life have been taken with judicious selection from the numerous puritan memoirs which formed an important division of american literature in the last and few preceding generations the memoirs of mrs harriet neweu and hopkinss memoirs of miss susanna anthony who died at newport rhode island in 1791 have manifestly been carefully read by mrs stowe in conclusion we may add that amongst the pleasant peculiarities of the book are innumerable americanisms some of them intentionally and some unconsciously employed by the author to educate young ladies is to  fetch them up and a matron wno superintends her domestic servants is said  to follow them round prominent too amongst its national characteristics the reader will notice the authors passion for  talking philosophy her familiar mention of plato as  an old heathen and her anxiety to display an intimate acquaintance with the art galleries and cathedrals of europe the annoyance of our transatlantic cousins at their own want of the memorials of ancient art is one of their most patent foibles and we are not awafre that it was ever more humorously expressed than by the new york merchant who on being reminded amidst the ruins of pompeii that his country was entirely devoid of any such interesting relics answered  yes

B6186,['5067427'],  sketch ofthe life character and writings of baroness de staelholstein  3 v   by madame necker de saussure translated from the french bvo pp 30j london is 20 madame de stael was a lady possessed o such extraor dinary genius and splendid talents and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character cannot fail of being interesting the first of female writers perhaps of this or of auy age she not only possessed a commanding influence in france during the most eventful period of its history but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness and respected if not admired in every state of europe some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of madame de stael and passing over the knowledge of human nature the fidelity of observation and the acuteness of remark which she displayed in all her writings haye with a most fastidious delicacy carped at some passages which taken even abstractedly were never doubtful the present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman but a critical examination of her writings aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life and when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of madame de stael who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting we will not follow madame de saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works of madame de stael and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged  but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life which is the more interesting as it is the least known in u  general examination ofthe talents of madame de stael the author remarks   before she appeared religion and knowledge had their separate defenders these two grand causes have been pleaded as we may say in opposition each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas there has been in this respect a secret division among mankind one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason the other that of faith out of pure civility  madame de stael alone has embraced with equal zeal the party of knowledge and that of religion she alone has adopted from the bottom of her heart whatever was best in different ages combating on one side ancient prejudices and ignorance and on the other modern selfishness and incredulity   madame de stael loved what was about her and extended to human nature her affection for her friends what her style wants of minute finish is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse by the freshness ofthe inspiration if i may venture to use the term lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain that sparkles as it flows  but something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties there is a marked originality in each yet all bearing a similar stamp which is pe culiar to madame de stael t his peculiar stamp originates from her character from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions from those sudden bursts of indignation of compassion of haughtiness and also from her never ceasing to be a woman  this last is perhaps her secret charm she addresses herself as a woman to the reader and presents herself personally to him to tell him what passes in her mind and also in his own but she is aware that he would soon forget her being a woman if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him accordingly whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle she never overpowers him with her superioritv he never arrogates to herself any preeminence it seems as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs and she recited what was thus offered to her view  sometimes too she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman whose sight is a little indistinct she explains to him all he perceives confusedly and places him in a bright sunshine that he may see a little more clearly himself when she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths she says to him  do not be afraid you will be glad you have passed we shall soon get safe out of it constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him she brings herself forward to divert him by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives persons words faces accents attitudesdresses every thing in fact strikes her every thing is characteristic in her pictures she knows herself as well as she knows others and that blind instinct which so frequently determines us to like or dislike is in hera feeling founded on motives of which she gives a clear account  the precision of her views is such that we forget their extreme clelicacy she has no vain subtilty does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible but even thing l  enlarges under her hands lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point and it becomes so distinct to her that none of its bearings escape her notice but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong the importance of which is acknowledged thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications  the copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect take at a venture any three of her pages and three of the authors most abounding in wit we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in madame de stael not that she affects conciseness every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together and perhaps there are two manyperhaps certain phrases which are superfluous to the train of reasoning have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck the succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in madame de stael to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it she is the goddess of plenty she scatters from full hands corn pearls roses ribands and diadems we would jet nothing escape us because every thing is of value but we may be fatigued in collecting it  on the whole the works of madame de stael appear to belong to a new age they announce as they tend to produce another period in society and in literature the age of strong generous animated thoughts sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart she has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort rather spoken than written of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies unrestrained confidence and conversational sallies inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics of the passions and of society than studied rhetoric has ever done the second part of this work is entitled  social and domestic life of madame de stael and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light   the distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her the sentiment was one and the same in her and assumed the decided cast of her character much more than that of the different relations of life or the disposition of the persons she loved in her maternal and filial affection friendship gratitude all seemed love lhere was passion or at least emotion in all her attachments they appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind and they were naturally expansive ardent impetuous and even stormy not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in madame de stael but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society and often human indolence oppose to the enjoyments of the heart for a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments that did not express themselves like hers and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error when she judged of others from herself but her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting her love was conspicuous through her anger she never gave pain to another but because she felt more herself and you could not avoid pitying her even when she wounded you most severely the affection of madame de stael for her father evinced itself on every occasion by the most watchful attention on him during his life and after his death she conceived she had lost everr earthly comfort with him  1 it would be necessary to relate how every day passed with madame de stael if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart she never ceased to live with him she always felt herself protected consoled succoured by him she invoked him in her prayers and never did any occurrence that was fortunate for her take place without her saying ic my father obtained that for ne his miniature she always carried about her and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition she never parted with it except on one occasion very ill herself and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait she imagined that when her daughter lay in it would produce the same effect on her accordingly she sent it to her desiring her to look on it when she was in pain every old man too recalled her father to her mind and made aparticular impression on her to every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible and once when in the time of her persecutions an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity then common and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age she wras extraordinarily grieved at it  i am very silly said she to me  but what would you have he was kind he was old he sat at my table i altered my hours for him and all these things grieve me to the heart her bounty to the aged who stood in need of her assistance was immense the idea of their sufferings tore her heart and as true christians see jesus christ in all who are poor she saw her father in every man that was old her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent and although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards madame de genlis who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms yet when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of madame necker it was with the utmost difficulty she could be restrained from resenting it  there is great beauty in the thought of that basrelief which after the death of m necker madame de stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents an airy figure as if already beatified is drawing towards the skies another that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled and prostrate on a tomb madame necker her husband and her daughter are represented under this emblem which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal the motto of madame de stael might have been the following verse which she often repeated with emotion    o liberte de rome 6 manes de mon peer   o roman freedom manes of my father  madame de stael could not avoid forming many friendshins she whispered this sentiment almost at first sight and she was touched with the effect which she produced and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections  there are ninety dtgrevs fixed saul she in my affections ami only ten moveable she was always free in her remarks on her friends and spared none of though objects of her attachment   this continual appreciation of her friends not only every one but of each daily this appreciation made incessantly  their presence sometimes hutt them and led them to doubt her affection  with you we must submit to be judged it fresh cost every morning said ito her  what signifies it answered she  if i love thee more every pveningrnbc added  were i going to the scaffold v could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me in her habitual society madame de stael was full of charms in burr company there was no restraint thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person  she asked only for amusement not for trials of skill i she could not endure people to talk with indifference how can he expect me to attend to him she would ay  when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself  she could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller  that man talks only of himself but he does not tyre me hecuase i am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says   she had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing  she wa the naturalist observing a species as well as the orator that would persuade  but what deranged this study completely what took from her all interest in peoples words was affectation this tault which effaces every prominent feature which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom instead of the inunene variety of moral nature was profoundly tiresome to her ami scarcely less vexatious she expressed herself thus on ihe subject  there is never any such thing as a tele dtce with affected people the personage assumed makes a third and it is thlsthat answers when you speak to the otheraffected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned exaggeration too displeased her much  lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten she would say for the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility all natural feeling she remarked  have a degree of modesty  from a sketch of her conversation political opitnons and repartees we shall select a few of the most striking passages  when she was told of the follies of some witty man she would say f give him more wit and all these will van h one of her swedish friends observing to her  whatever von may say witty people commit a great many faults die answered  that is very true  but unfortunately stupid persons do the same though nobody thinks it worth while to ur  tice them another time she said  the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men  her attachment to france never abated not even ui i she had been banished from it ami incurred the enmity of its rulers i have a corroding grief respecting france she wrote  which 1 love more than ever and again  i have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that france but it must be confessed her country was more eset lally paris   show me the rue de bac said she once to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e i ac of geneva and its banks  i would willingly live at fris said she again  with a hundred pounds a j ear itt a lodging up four pair of stairs in 1806 when shepent four dtys ni paris in concealment her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night to view the streets by moonlight  i have a constancy of heart she wrote u and an inconstancy of mind for whick a country is formed where the scenes are incessantly renewing and where 1 have my old friends   it is very remarkable that always cutting to the quick in disputation always touching the most sensible points she always conciliated in her presence those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies you might be grazed be wounded in the contest but you always went away healed or at least she had applied balsam to the sore   you desire then my death or my dishonour said an emigrant to her in switzerland as he was going to the army on the frontiers  no answered she  what i wish is your defeat and yourglcry i would have you except being slain be like hector the hero of a vanquished army  the following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events  while she was in england in 1814 some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of paris which put an end to her banishment to these expressions of politeness she answered  on what do you compliment me pray on my being in the height of distress  it was from the date of the battle of leipzig that she began to be alarmed for france 4 in 1815 when bonaparte had already entered lyons a lady attached to his party came and said to madame de stael  the emperor knows madame how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes i hope answered she  he will know how much i detest him  during the hundred days she said  if all the declamatory phrases uttered this winter against the revolution had been enlisted we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the coth of march  in 1810 mr canning having thought proper to say to madame de stael in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bedchamber in the palace of the tuillcries  lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions madam france has submitted to u and we have conquered youyes answered sile  because you had all europe and the cossacs on your side but meet us tetedtete and we shall see she  said also to mr canning  the english nation is deceived  it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion  if it knew this it would renounce those who thus abuse its name   fiance said she  must remain as dead as long as it is occupied by foreigners first let us have independence and then think of libertv  she said of mr de bonald  he is the philosopher of antiphilosophy  but this will not carry a man very far   the ministerial party observed she  looks at the prosaic side of human nature and opposition at the poetical side this is why i have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter  some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures what would you have me say answered she he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality and he who has not should not accept a post of difficulty  in 1816 she said of the ministry  i do not like it yet 1 prefer it it is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses yet still it is a barrier  on occasion of the great number of persons enobled she said  it would be best to create france a marquis once for all l  she set no great value on puns yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness in a dispute on the slave trade with a french lady of high rank the latter said to her 4t what madam then you are much interested for the count of limonade and the marquis of marmalade why not as much as for the duke of bouillon  answered she  bonaparte having caused her to be told in 1815 that she must return to paris because he wanted her for the sake of constitutional ideas she refused saying  he contrived to do without a constitution and without me for a dozen years and he has now the same regard for the one that he has for the other even at this period however when any frenchmen passed by coppet in their way to join the army ofthe allies she endeavoured to divert them from their design not approving their endangering the independence of the nation even to acquire liberty  she was already dangerously ill when the  manuscript from st helena began to make a great noise in france notwithstanding the state of weakness to which madame de stael was reduced she made her children read the work to her and criticised it with all her strength of mind  the chaldeans worshipped the serpent said she the bonapartists do the same to the manuscript from st helena but i am far from sharing their admiration lt is but in the style of the notes ofthe moniteur and if ever i recover i think i can refute this writing with a high hand  r one of bonapartes ministers having desired her to be told that the emperor would reward her if she would attach herself to him she answered  i was aware that a certificate of being alive is necessary to the receipt of an annuity but i did not know that it required a declaration of love  notwithstanding the liberality and noble facility of madame de staels disposition great order was observed in the management of her house and estate so that her circumstances were constantly prosperous when under her government her mornings she devoted to business that is to the care of her property and to study and her evenings to society and to correspondence   the only luxury on which she set any value was the having accommodation for her friends and being able to invite to dinner persons with whom she wished to become acquainted  i have hired a cook that travels postsaid she  is not this exactly what i wanted to give dinners in dishabille throughout europe   the following anecdote is highly characteristic and displays madame de stael in a very amiable point of view   about twenty years ago when on a visit to me in the country it was proposed to play proverbs a sketch of marmontel entitled le barara the prater was selected in which a great lady ill and nervous consents to use her interest in favour of an old soldier who is soliciting a pension but on the express condition that he states his case to her in the fewest words possible the prater who is duly cautioned beforehand nevertheless indulges himself in such an exuberance of words that he exhausts the patience of his patroness and she will have nothing more to say to him madame de stael represented the great lady at first she acted her part very well she counterfeited languor to perfection next weariness then vexation and impatience but when the moment came for inflicting pain on the old soldier it was impossible for her to bring herself to this he had spoken of his wife and children he was at bottom one of the best men in the world it required too hard a heart to refuse him quitting therefore altogether her assumed character and totally destroying the point ofthe piece she told him with real emotion that in future he had better not talk so much but that for this time she would undertake his suit suclvin fact wat madame de stael she was not only incapable of giving pain to any person voluntarily but subject as she was to ennui she really felt none when she could be useful to others of her religious character we have the following account   among the happy effects of time on madame de stael 4 l  ii11 j  1  1     14t matta which had always looked to the consequences of her actions attached themselves more to their motives prayer that sentimental want of hers placing her incessantly in communication with the source of all excellence caused a pure light to penetrate her heart  whenever i am alone i pray said she to her children she wrote to me from sweden on the subject of mr de montmorency   there is no such thing as absence to the religious because they meet in the sentiment of prayer every moment we find in her letters a request to pray for her and her children  madame de stael thought it was pride in man to endeavour to penetrate the secret of the universe and speaking of the higher metaphysics she said  i prefer the lords prayer to it all during her long sleeplessness she was accustomed to repeat this prayer incessantly in order to calm her mind sighs certain exclamations that she was in the habit of uttering were with her pious invocations thus the following words that escaped her frequently  poor human nature alas what are we ah life life were religious sentiments venting themselves lu her last illness she was seen constantly exerting the virtues for which she was distinguished  and on the days when she suffered most pain she was employed in acts of kindness s she was heard to utter delightful sayings in her peculiar way t i have always been the same lively and sad she observed to mr chateaubriand  i love god my father and liberty  on quoting these words of fontenelle  i am a frenchman i am fourscore years old yet i never ridiculed the slightest virtue she added i can say as much of the slightest suffering  unquestionably she felt great regret at parting with her children and friends stoicism or the particular kind of enthusiasm that is capable of closing the heart to the pains of eternal separation entered not into her character her daughter in particular cost her many tears  with such treasures of affection she dictated for me in speaking of the objects of her regard  it is a sad thing to quit life  i should be very sorry she said likewise  if every thing were at an end between albertine madame de broglie and me in another world but she rather regretted life than really feared death she may have dreaded the last pangs an imagination like hers may have felt some horrors at the idea of physical dissolution terrible as it is to all of us  but death morally considered gave her no alarm she preserved so much tranquility as to wish to dictate to mr schlegel the description of what she felt her thoughts were always turned with hope towards her father and towards immortality  my father waits for me on the other shore she said she beheld her father with god and in god himself could see nothing but a father these two ideas were confounded in her heart and that of a protecting goodness was inseparable from both one day rousing from a state of reverie she said  i think i know what the transition from life to death is and i am sure that the goodness of god softens it to us our ideas become confused and the pain is not very acute  her confidence was not disappointed the profoundest tranquillity presided over her last moments long before she expired the grand struggle had ended and her soul departed gently it can scarcely be necessary to extend this article by any further remarks on madame de stael or on the present work that it is written with the partiality of a friend and an ardent admirer of madame de stael is avowed and yet there is scarcely an assertion or an opinion respecting her that has not already been justified or is so by the present volume this work is published in french so that those who may prefer reading it in the original will have the opportunity we may however observe that the translation is well executed,biography

of the trite information conveyed in the former lines of this curious epitaph or the elegance of those which followit is said by mr langhame cotemporary with mrs behn that her memory will be long cherished among the lovers of the drama the majority of her comedies were successfulshe seems to have been a plagiarist ather from haste than sterility of imagination being at times compelled to write by pressing and urgent necessity she received the incense and compliments of the men of literature of her times among whom may be reckoned mr charles cotton who prefixed to her  lovers watch some complimentary linesmr charles gibson with whom she lived in habits of friendship observes it that she extorted admiration by maintaining the force and gaiety of her genius in the midst of disappointmenthe addsi she had great strength of mind and command of her faculties being able to write in the midst of comupany and at the same time take a share in conversation her works though reprehensible for their licentiousness abound in the language of passion her personal qualities are thus described by the writer of her memoirs  she had an open generous temper somewhat choleric yet friendly and placable incapable of doing a wilful injury she had wit honour goodnature and judgment mistress of the arts of converration yet frank and sincere a woman of sense and a lover of pleasure more gay and free than allowed by the strict yet without transgressing tie rules af modesty the last commendation however applicable to her manners and conversation cannot it is to be regretted be

exhibit another of our fair countrywomen with whose his tory the common reader is perhaps not acquainted anne baynard only daughter of dr edward baynard was born at preston in lancashire in 16712 her father perceiving in her the promise of superior talents assisted their development by a liberal education the rapid progress and improvement made by anne in different branches of science and learning did credit to the judgement of her father and testified the promise of her early years she died prematurely in the 25th year of her age the following particulars of her character and endowments are extracted from the funeral sermon preached by john prude at the parish church of barnes  by this gentleman we are informed that she was well acquainted with philosophy astronomy mathematics and physics that she was snot only conversant with these sciences but a mistress of them and that to such a degree as few of her sex ever attained she was familiar with the writingi of the ancients in their original languages at the age of twentythree she took great pains to perfect herself in the greek language that she might have the pleasure of reading in their native purity the works of st chrysostom her compositions in latin were written in a pure and elegant style i she was accustomed to declare that it was a sin to be content with alittle knowledge about twvo years previous to her death her spirits seem to have been impressed swith an idea of her early dissolution a sentiment which first suggested itself to her mind while walking alone among the tombs in a churchyard and which she indulged with a kind of superstitious complacency on her deathbed she earnestly entreated the minister who attended her to exhort all the young people of his congregation to the stud of wisdom and knowledge as the means of moral improvement and real happiness the fillowing character is given of this lady in mr colliers historical dictionary anne bi vnard for her prudence piety and learning

B7247,"['8940843', '2440875']",  princes8 helene von racowitza8 auto i biography translated from the ger i man by cecil mar constable  co princess helene von racowrtzas autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of george merediths novels and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of the tragic comedians in the memorial edition of his works it is now rather more than thirty years since the princess published that account of her relations with lassalle upon which meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained his explanation brilliant and masterly as it was omitted a very important factor after all the strangest action of the heroine of the story was not her submission to her familywhich had it been the action of one of his own heroines meredith would conceivably have praised nor yet her marriage with the luckless yanko for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion and a somewhat too com placent champion of her own part in the affair clotilde the princess as meredith represents her would have been both too astute and too selfconscious to have committed this astounding blunder but the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked lassalle whether the countess hatzfeld would have to live with them an incident omitted by mere dith who no doubt thought it an in vention of the princesss and the first thing to recognise about clotildes original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing in a spirit of in genuousness verging upon fatuity  this she writes of her present volume ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child the autobiography then convinces us that the story of  the tragio comedians like that of another lady of high distinction for wit and beauty curiously enough merediths next is to be read as fiction  nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them though not a few are discoverable the whole course of the princess helenes life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with clotildes she was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous dashing manner and she went on her way vaguely drifting spasmodically candid playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures it accepting these in whatever form they offered themselves with open arm while still a child she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life and carried them into practice bw she submitted formally to her parents choice where suitors were concerned s0 that on meeting lassalle when she va nineteen she was the typical  jeune file allemande incapable of selfdirection and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility durng the short period of her engagement to lassalle she wanted she says  to tell him all about my past life and my crimes against saintly morality  but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand no no for heavens sake dont let us have any pompeian excavations   and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the autobiography the pages that treaty of lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume but even without them it would be worth reading so great is the variety of the writers experiences her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed she handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence with the support of course of her exuberant vitality that she adopted at need or was ready to adopt the professions of actress physician artist journalist in turnnot without success or some promise of it in all she was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination and took up flower  painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time indeed there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writers practical ability and common sense it is not less remarkable though less engaging that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth the conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to lassalles death a narrative sincere and poignant but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks is puzzlingly absurd the gigantic edifice of the german empire must always she writes have seemed like a prison  to lassalle  i therefore ask whether we pigmies all of us were not mere puppets in the

B3831,"['4362019', '8780227']",  thie otuardiain angel 4 it is not easy to discover the drift of this poemn and we incline to think that the author has stopped short of his original intention and presented his readers only with a fragtment but however this may be  the guardian angel  is a work of merit it is iin the form of a drama  and the purpose seems to be to show the infillence of a good woman over a nature of fierce impulse agnes the heroine while abroad has saved oliver from commmitting murder on his retura t wales he sees her again and appears anxious to marry her so as to have his guardiani angel always at his side but lhe falls over a cliff and dies  and whether adrian who is also in love with agnes marries her we are not told nor does it appear that her influence over oliver has been very effectual for he plainly intends to murder adrian a few minutes before he meets with his fatal accident thus the cliff over which he fell is better entitled to the name of the dramia than agnes herself and it seems rather due to his fall than to her that he dies in a christian state of mind the other poems are passable  thc guardian angel new novels by oliver wendell holmes 2 vols low  co to the more thoughtful and critical of those who are likely to peruse his new novel mr wendell holmes is at pains to set forth in a lengthy preface the purpose of the tale which relates to the character and doings of myrtle hazard in whose blood an element of rebellious wildness derived from an aboriginal indian ancestor is at war with the physical and moral forces which she inherits from her anglosaxon progenitors  i have attempted says the author  to show the successive evolutions of some inherited qualities in ihe character  of myrtle hazard not so obtrusively as to disturb the narrative but plainly enough to bc  kept in sight by the small class of preface  readers the novel that requires to be thus  explained in a preface is manifestly deficient in one of the most important qualities of a i good tale  and the worst that we have to urge  against the guardian angel is said when j we admit that without the authors considerate  preface we should certainly have failed to  apprehend his special design and that even i with the aid of his prefatory intimation we j are unable to see how his book is calculated  to effect his object like its precursor  elsie vernier the tale is termed by the author  a j study of reflex function in its highest sphere j by which term he fears that he may  frighten  away all but the professors and learned ladies j and though without laying claim to rank with j either of these two classes of severely philo j sophie readers we were in no way disposed to  tremble at his hard words we must confess j that when we found the story dull and inco herent they did not tend to influence our  judgement in its favour throughout the earlier chapters we were inclined to think well of the book and to hope that on working into the middle of the first volume we should take a strong interest in the passionate child whose peculiaritiesamply accounted for by the cheerlessness of her life and the severity of her training in a gloomy home and therefore by no means referable to the physical cause to which the author assigns themare sketched with force and delicacy but as the novel progresses to the end of its first half growing more devoid of  story  with every turn of a leaf the heroine loses all power over the readers imagination and by the time she has tunied out a commonplace schoolgirl in a fashionable college for young ladies she has altogether ceased to be in the slightest degree interesting as a psychological curiosity some of the subordinate personages of the drama are presented with cleverness for instance mr byles gridley ma the mild benevolent bookworm is so well managed that for the pleasure of watching his humorous nature and amiable disposition under circumstances more favourable to their display we could wish that mr holmes had put him on a better stage and given him a worthier part as well as worthier companions some skill and originality are also shown in the coarse delineation of the rev mr stoker who is for a time myrtle hazards religious adviser and ghostly enemy and of whom it is recorded  the rev mr stoker was a man of emotions he loved to feel his heart beat he loved all the forms of nonalcoholic drunkenness which are so much better than the vinous because they taste themselves so keenly whereas the other according to the statement of experts who are familia with its curious phenomena has a certain sense of unreality connected with it he delighted in the reflex stimulus of the excitement be produced in others by working on their feelings a powerful preacher is open to thc same sense of

austere aunt miss silence withers and her loyal defender nurse byloeexhibit artistic merits that might almost be extolled for excellence but other characters of the story are just as poor and

of what is i j technically termed  story so singularly de fective is it in this respect that if mr 1 i holmes should ever be required to reissue the j  work in a second edition he would d well to i

preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature

of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the

a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath  your neighbour is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutysir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane  it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles  a more touching scene is that between sir charles pomander and mrs vanesir charles is in love with mrs vane  now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband pomander  what madam all alone here as in shropshiremabel for the moment sir pomander  force of habit a husband with a wife in shropshire is so like a bachelormabel sirpomander and our excellent ernest is such a favouritemabel no wonder sirpomander  few can so pass from the larva state of country

macbeth weeps over her lapdog dead from repletion and belvidere soothes her broken heart with a dozen of oysters in a word it is the place where actors and actresses become men and women and act their own parts with skill instead of a poets clumsilymabel actors actresses does mr vane frequent suchpomander  he has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborn to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy  you would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a frienda friend  he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what

cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed  said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  my last letter written upon th roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly  read me the passage madam on which you argue1 poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish  i had but my husband and my god in the world cried she  my mother is gone my god have pity on me my husband does not love me there is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition the very clever scene in which mrs woffington imitates mrs bracegirdles acting and leads cibber to believe that the real bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as cibber was concernedwhat mrs woffington who had never seen mrs bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous apology  that this country has yet seen  the thing is impossible for cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last mr vane might have been

B6219,['5067427'],  sketch ofthe life character and writings of baroness de staelholstein  3 v   by madame necker de saussure translated from the french bvo pp 30j london is 20 madame de stael was a lady possessed o such extraor dinary genius and splendid talents and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character cannot fail of being interesting the first of female writers perhaps of this or of auy age she not only possessed a commanding influence in france during the most eventful period of its history but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness and respected if not admired in every state of europe some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of madame de stael and passing over the knowledge of human nature the fidelity of observation and the acuteness of remark which she displayed in all her writings haye with a most fastidious delicacy carped at some passages which taken even abstractedly were never doubtful the present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman but a critical examination of her writings aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life and when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of madame de stael who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting we will not follow madame de saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works of madame de stael and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged  but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life which is the more interesting as it is the least known in u  general examination ofthe talents of madame de stael the author remarks   before she appeared religion and knowledge had their separate defenders these two grand causes have been pleaded as we may say in opposition each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas there has been in this respect a secret division among mankind one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason the other that of faith out of pure civility  madame de stael alone has embraced with equal zeal the party of knowledge and that of religion she alone has adopted from the bottom of her heart whatever was best in different ages combating on one side ancient prejudices and ignorance and on the other modern selfishness and incredulity   madame de stael loved what was about her and extended to human nature her affection for her friends what her style wants of minute finish is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse by the freshness ofthe inspiration if i may venture to use the term lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain that sparkles as it flows  but something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties there is a marked originality in each yet all bearing a similar stamp which is pe culiar to madame de stael t his peculiar stamp originates from her character from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions from those sudden bursts of indignation of compassion of haughtiness and also from her never ceasing to be a woman  this last is perhaps her secret charm she addresses herself as a woman to the reader and presents herself personally to him to tell him what passes in her mind and also in his own but she is aware that he would soon forget her being a woman if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him accordingly whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle she never overpowers him with her superioritv he never arrogates to herself any preeminence it seems as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs and she recited what was thus offered to her view  sometimes too she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman whose sight is a little indistinct she explains to him all he perceives confusedly and places him in a bright sunshine that he may see a little more clearly himself when she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths she says to him  do not be afraid you will be glad you have passed we shall soon get safe out of it constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him she brings herself forward to divert him by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives persons words faces accents attitudesdresses every thing in fact strikes her every thing is characteristic in her pictures she knows herself as well as she knows others and that blind instinct which so frequently determines us to like or dislike is in hera feeling founded on motives of which she gives a clear account  the precision of her views is such that we forget their extreme clelicacy she has no vain subtilty does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible but even thing l  enlarges under her hands lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point and it becomes so distinct to her that none of its bearings escape her notice but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong the importance of which is acknowledged thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications  the copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect take at a venture any three of her pages and three of the authors most abounding in wit we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in madame de stael not that she affects conciseness every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together and perhaps there are two manyperhaps certain phrases which are superfluous to the train of reasoning have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck the succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in madame de stael to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it she is the goddess of plenty she scatters from full hands corn pearls roses ribands and diadems we would jet nothing escape us because every thing is of value but we may be fatigued in collecting it  on the whole the works of madame de stael appear to belong to a new age they announce as they tend to produce another period in society and in literature the age of strong generous animated thoughts sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart she has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort rather spoken than written of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies unrestrained confidence and conversational sallies inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics of the passions and of society than studied rhetoric has ever done the second part of this work is entitled  social and domestic life of madame de stael and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light   the distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her the sentiment was one and the same in her and assumed the decided cast of her character much more than that of the different relations of life or the disposition of the persons she loved in her maternal and filial affection friendship gratitude all seemed love lhere was passion or at least emotion in all her attachments they appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind and they were naturally expansive ardent impetuous and even stormy not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in madame de stael but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society and often human indolence oppose to the enjoyments of the heart for a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments that did not express themselves like hers and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error when she judged of others from herself but her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting her love was conspicuous through her anger she never gave pain to another but because she felt more herself and you could not avoid pitying her even when she wounded you most severely the affection of madame de stael for her father evinced itself on every occasion by the most watchful attention on him during his life and after his death she conceived she had lost everr earthly comfort with him  1 it would be necessary to relate how every day passed with madame de stael if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart she never ceased to live with him she always felt herself protected consoled succoured by him she invoked him in her prayers and never did any occurrence that was fortunate for her take place without her saying ic my father obtained that for ne his miniature she always carried about her and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition she never parted with it except on one occasion very ill herself and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait she imagined that when her daughter lay in it would produce the same effect on her accordingly she sent it to her desiring her to look on it when she was in pain every old man too recalled her father to her mind and made aparticular impression on her to every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible and once when in the time of her persecutions an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity then common and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age she wras extraordinarily grieved at it  i am very silly said she to me  but what would you have he was kind he was old he sat at my table i altered my hours for him and all these things grieve me to the heart her bounty to the aged who stood in need of her assistance was immense the idea of their sufferings tore her heart and as true christians see jesus christ in all who are poor she saw her father in every man that was old her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent and although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards madame de genlis who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms yet when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of madame necker it was with the utmost difficulty she could be restrained from resenting it  there is great beauty in the thought of that basrelief which after the death of m necker madame de stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents an airy figure as if already beatified is drawing towards the skies another that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled and prostrate on a tomb madame necker her husband and her daughter are represented under this emblem which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal the motto of madame de stael might have been the following verse which she often repeated with emotion    o liberte de rome 6 manes de mon peer   o roman freedom manes of my father  madame de stael could not avoid forming many friendshins she whispered this sentiment almost at first sight and she was touched with the effect which she produced and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections  there are ninety dtgrevs fixed saul she in my affections ami only ten moveable she was always free in her remarks on her friends and spared none of though objects of her attachment   this continual appreciation of her friends not only every one but of each daily this appreciation made incessantly  their presence sometimes hutt them and led them to doubt her affection  with you we must submit to be judged it fresh cost every morning said ito her  what signifies it answered she  if i love thee more every pveningrnbc added  were i going to the scaffold v could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me in her habitual society madame de stael was full of charms in burr company there was no restraint thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person  she asked only for amusement not for trials of skill i she could not endure people to talk with indifference how can he expect me to attend to him she would ay  when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself  she could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller  that man talks only of himself but he does not tyre me hecuase i am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says   she had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing  she wa the naturalist observing a species as well as the orator that would persuade  but what deranged this study completely what took from her all interest in peoples words was affectation this tault which effaces every prominent feature which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom instead of the inunene variety of moral nature was profoundly tiresome to her ami scarcely less vexatious she expressed herself thus on ihe subject  there is never any such thing as a tele dtce with affected people the personage assumed makes a third and it is thlsthat answers when you speak to the otheraffected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned exaggeration too displeased her much  lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten she would say for the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility all natural feeling she remarked  have a degree of modesty  from a sketch of her conversation political opitnons and repartees we shall select a few of the most striking passages  when she was told of the follies of some witty man she would say f give him more wit and all these will van h one of her swedish friends observing to her  whatever von may say witty people commit a great many faults die answered  that is very true  but unfortunately stupid persons do the same though nobody thinks it worth while to ur  tice them another time she said  the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men  her attachment to france never abated not even ui i she had been banished from it ami incurred the enmity of its rulers i have a corroding grief respecting france she wrote  which 1 love more than ever and again  i have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that france but it must be confessed her country was more eset lally paris   show me the rue de bac said she once to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e i ac of geneva and its banks  i would willingly live at fris said she again  with a hundred pounds a j ear itt a lodging up four pair of stairs in 1806 when shepent four dtys ni paris in concealment her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night to view the streets by moonlight  i have a constancy of heart she wrote u and an inconstancy of mind for whick a country is formed where the scenes are incessantly renewing and where 1 have my old friends   it is very remarkable that always cutting to the quick in disputation always touching the most sensible points she always conciliated in her presence those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies you might be grazed be wounded in the contest but you always went away healed or at least she had applied balsam to the sore   you desire then my death or my dishonour said an emigrant to her in switzerland as he was going to the army on the frontiers  no answered she  what i wish is your defeat and yourglcry i would have you except being slain be like hector the hero of a vanquished army  the following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events  while she was in england in 1814 some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of paris which put an end to her banishment to these expressions of politeness she answered  on what do you compliment me pray on my being in the height of distress  it was from the date of the battle of leipzig that she began to be alarmed for france 4 in 1815 when bonaparte had already entered lyons a lady attached to his party came and said to madame de stael  the emperor knows madame how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes i hope answered she  he will know how much i detest him  during the hundred days she said  if all the declamatory phrases uttered this winter against the revolution had been enlisted we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the coth of march  in 1810 mr canning having thought proper to say to madame de stael in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bedchamber in the palace of the tuillcries  lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions madam france has submitted to u and we have conquered youyes answered sile  because you had all europe and the cossacs on your side but meet us tetedtete and we shall see she  said also to mr canning  the english nation is deceived  it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion  if it knew this it would renounce those who thus abuse its name   fiance said she  must remain as dead as long as it is occupied by foreigners first let us have independence and then think of libertv  she said of mr de bonald  he is the philosopher of antiphilosophy  but this will not carry a man very far   the ministerial party observed she  looks at the prosaic side of human nature and opposition at the poetical side this is why i have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter  some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures what would you have me say answered she he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality and he who has not should not accept a post of difficulty  in 1816 she said of the ministry  i do not like it yet 1 prefer it it is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses yet still it is a barrier  on occasion of the great number of persons enobled she said  it would be best to create france a marquis once for all l  she set no great value on puns yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness in a dispute on the slave trade with a french lady of high rank the latter said to her 4t what madam then you are much interested for the count of limonade and the marquis of marmalade why not as much as for the duke of bouillon  answered she  bonaparte having caused her to be told in 1815 that she must return to paris because he wanted her for the sake of constitutional ideas she refused saying  he contrived to do without a constitution and without me for a dozen years and he has now the same regard for the one that he has for the other even at this period however when any frenchmen passed by coppet in their way to join the army ofthe allies she endeavoured to divert them from their design not approving their endangering the independence of the nation even to acquire liberty  she was already dangerously ill when the  manuscript from st helena began to make a great noise in france notwithstanding the state of weakness to which madame de stael was reduced she made her children read the work to her and

would reward her if she would attach herself to him she answered  i was aware that a certificate of being alive is necessary to the receipt of an annuity but i did not know that it required a declaration of love  notwithstanding the liberality and noble facility of madame de staels disposition great order was observed in the management of her house and estate so that her circumstances were constantly prosperous when under her government her mornings she devoted to business that is to the care of her property and to study and her evenings to society and to correspondence   the only

postsaid she  is not this exactly what i wanted to give dinners in dishabille throughout europe   the following anecdote is highly characteristic and displays madame de stael in a very amiable point of view   about twenty years ago when on a visit to me in the country it was proposed to play proverbs a sketch of marmontel entitled le barara the prater was selected in which a great lady ill and nervous consents to use her interest in favour of an old soldier who is soliciting a pension but on the express condition that he states his case to her in the fewest words possible the prater who is duly cautioned beforehand nevertheless indulges himself in such an exuberance of words that he exhausts the patience of his patroness and she will have nothing more to say to him madame de stael represented the great lady at first she acted her part very well she counterfeited languor to perfection next weariness then vexation and impatience but when the moment came for inflicting pain on the old soldier it was impossible for her to bring herself to this he had spoken of his wife and children he was at bottom one of the best men in the world it required too hard a heart to refuse him quitting therefore altogether her assumed character and totally destroying the point ofthe piece she told him with real emotion that in future he had better not talk so much but that for this time she would undertake his suit suclvin fact wat madame de stael she was not only incapable of giving pain to any person voluntarily but subject as she was to ennui she really felt none when she could be useful to others of her religious character we have the following account   among the happy effects of time on madame de stael 4 l  ii11 j  1  1     14t matta which had always looked to the consequences of her actions attached themselves more to their motives prayer that sentimental want of hers placing her incessantly in communication with the source of all excellence caused a pure light to penetrate her heart  whenever i am alone i pray said she to her children she wrote to me from sweden on the subject of mr de montmorency   there is no such thing as absence to the religious because they meet in the sentiment of prayer every moment we find in her letters a request to pray for her and her children  madame de stael thought it was pride in man to endeavour to penetrate the secret of the universe and speaking of the higher metaphysics she said  i prefer the lords prayer to it all during her long sleeplessness she was accustomed to repeat this prayer incessantly in order to calm her mind sighs certain exclamations that she was in the habit of uttering were with her pious invocations thus the following words that escaped her frequently  poor human nature alas what are we ah life life were religious sentiments venting themselves lu her last illness she was seen constantly exerting the virtues for which she was distinguished  and on the days when she suffered most pain she was employed in acts of kindness s she was heard to utter delightful sayings in her peculiar way t i have always been the same lively and sad she observed to mr chateaubriand  i love god my father and liberty  on quoting these words of fontenelle  i am a frenchman i am fourscore years old yet i never ridiculed the slightest virtue she added i can say as much of the slightest suffering  unquestionably she felt great regret at parting with her children and friends stoicism or the particular kind of enthusiasm that is capable of closing the heart to the pains of eternal separation entered not into her character her daughter in particular cost her many tears  with such treasures of affection she dictated for me in speaking of the objects of her regard  it is a sad thing to quit life  i should be very sorry she said likewise  if every thing were at an end between albertine madame de broglie and me in another world but she rather regretted life than really feared death she may have dreaded the last pangs an imagination like hers may have felt some horrors at the idea of physical dissolution terrible as it is to all of us  but death morally considered gave her no alarm she preserved so much tranquility as to wish to dictate to mr schlegel the description of what she felt her thoughts were always turned with hope towards her father and towards immortality  my father waits for me on the other shore she said she beheld her father with god and in god himself could see nothing but a father these two ideas were confounded in her heart and that of a protecting goodness was inseparable from both one day rousing from a state of reverie she said  i think i know what the transition from life to death is and i am sure that the goodness of god softens it to us our ideas become confused and the pain is not very acute  her confidence was not disappointed the profoundest tranquillity presided over her last moments long before she expired the grand struggle had ended and her soul departed gently it can scarcely be necessary to extend this article by any further remarks on madame de stael or on the present work that it is written with the partiality of a friend and an ardent admirer of madame de stael is avowed and yet there is scarcely an assertion or an opinion respecting her that has not already been justified or is so by the present volume this work is published in french so that those who may prefer reading it in the original will have the opportunity we may however observe that the translation is well executed,biography

B5881,"['8880211', '6788507']",  the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,biography
B2566,['6687957'],  impzressitons of theophsrastu such by george eliot w blackwood  sons the interest which is felt when a distinguished cultivator of one branch of literature takes to the cultivation of another branch is a perfectly natural and legitimate interest there is certainly no reason why an excellent novelist should not be a good poet and still less reason why an excellent novelist should not write excellent essays a reader therefore may be pardoned who takes up the impressicm8 of theophrastus such with a pleasant anticipation of finding something good there it is not to be for gotten that george eliots special excellences in novel writing are such as might with reason be thought likely to enable her to write good essays of the moralist kind she has at any rate in her best novel work displayed in occasional reflections and apophthegms exactly the acuteness of observation and the power of expressing its results which the ethi cal essayist most needs and pearls are usually no worse for being strung in connexion instead of scattered at hazard it so happens too though perhaps this is a consider ation of a rather doubleedged character that we have very little essay work nowadays of the kind which england and france pro duced so abundantly between the middle of the seventeenth and the middle of the eighteenth century there is an immense amount of diluted matter of a not dissimilar kind published in weekly and daily journals and now and then a writer may attempt something more mature and concentrated in magazines and reviews but on the whole no collection of the british essayists is in the near future likely to go much beyond eliaalthough a smart journalist did remark the other day that the only reason for the popularity of lambs essays was that few people could do the thing then whereas if they had appeared today they would have been lost amid the superior work of the same kind now daily appearing that the reader who takes up theop7lastus such in such a mood as that which we have indicated is likely to be a good deal dis appointed may be as well said at once and frankly the author has attempted a form which is not an easy one and has not observed its limitations before we have got very far into the book and still more when we jay it down we feel that there is either too much or too little of mr such the essayist who wishes to utter his opinions through the mouth of a feigned personage must give him at least something of a body for our thoughts to take hold of mr such is little more than a disembodied shadow with a name attached to it and this being the case we feel that we could do without his shadow and his name altogether a more doubtful point is the adoption more majorun of fictitious but halfsignificant names for the minor characters introduced or discussed in passing there is perhaps something a little cumbrous about this to the taste of the present day but it is a matter of no great consequence the reader would probably be prepared to pardon a good many imperfections in the setting if the stones set were abundant of pure water and cut in a workmanlike manner it is however hereto drop the metaphor it is in the quality and wording of the thoughts it containsthat the principal weakness of the book consists the essayist has two different manners in which he may allowably and successfully put what he has to say there is the garrulous fluent and somewhat buttonholing manner and there is the manner in which the writer devotes his utmost energies to compressing and polishing his phrase till it has at least something of the pregnancy and of the brilliancy of joubert or of rochefoucauld there may be third fourth or fifth manners which are allowable but they have not hitherto been tried at any rate successfully in literature now we hardly think that george eliot has succeeded in working up her matter in either of these possible ways no one expects her to be easily garrulous but she might have been expected to be full and at the same time terse and clearcut there is too much in theophrastus stich to which these epithets can by no stretch of compliment be applied sometimes though it must be confessed not so often as might have been expected the fault lies in the use of unfamiliar and technical expressions when we are presented with such a pensie as the following  may there not be at least a partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a mans philo sophy is the formula of his personality  it must be a very dull or a very easy literary sense upon which the use of the word formula does not jar but there is not very much of this error a worse and a more frequent one may be best illustrated by a couple of quota tions  one wonders whether the remarkable originatorm who first had the notion of digging wells or of churning for butter and who certainly were very useful to their own time as well as to ours were left quite free from invidious comparisons with predecessors who let the water and the milk alone or whether some rhetorical nomad as he stretched himself on the grass with a good appetite for contemporary butter became loud on the virtues of ancestors who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow  nay whether in a high flight of imaginative sacrificeafter swallowing the butterhe even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of a generation more naive than his own  it has sometimes occurred to me when i have been taking a slice of excellent ham that from a too tenable point of view i was breakfasting on a small squealing black pig which more than half a century ago was the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise acknowledged by tie grudgingfarmer or dairyman who parted with him one enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward and such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham but since i have nevertheless eaten it the chief effect has been to moderate the severity of my radicalism which was not part of my paternal inheritance and to raise the assuaging reflection that if the pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my historical point of view they would have seen themselves and the rector in a light that would have made tithe voluntary now we are very far from thinking that there is nothing worth saying in these ponderous sentences but it is evident that the author instead of seeking to compress and point her thought has allowed it to bulge in any and every direction she has constantly inserted side reflections as they occurred to her regardless of the total effect and pitiless to the unfortunate reader who has begun a sympathetic grin and has to keep his muscles on the stretch for half a page before he is allowed to relax them she has reversed jouberts process and appears to be tormented by the ambition of putting a word into a paragraph and a para graph into a chapter and a chapter into a book this inability to stop when enough has been said is still more remarkable inl such a sentence as the following not that merman had a wrangling disposition he put all his doubts and queries and paradoxes deferentially contended without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the personality of homer expressed himself civilly though formally on the origin of language and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the socalled elementary substances his own total scepticism concerning manethos chronology or even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the outbreak of revolutionary tendencies surely george eliots demon must have whispered stop suggestivelyat homer imperatively at the origin of language and despairingly at elementary substances the sentence as it stands is not a witticism but a catalogue although however this fatal error per vades the book and deprives it of a claim to rank with essay work of the best kind the reader unless he is a very unreasonable person is not likely to think his time wasted or to complain that he is sent away empty no one of george eliots powers could pro duce reflections on subjects of interestand such are nearly all the matters touched upon in this volume  without those reflections being themselves interesting with the ast essay a vigorous apologia for the jews we have little to do here because it is entirely political in tone and hardly touches at all on the purely literary objections to the handling of the jewish element in daniel derondd the best of the essays beyond all question is looking backward a charming description with hardly any veil of the writers earlier days in the midland counties the description of english scenery on page 50 is equal to the very best thing she has ever done so again is the short episode of the manservant pummelled in  the watchdog of knowledge this delightful person who on being asked the cause of the tides answers well sir nobody rightly knows many gives their opinion but if i was to give mine it ud be different  and who is troubled to think of adams surprise at the assembled animals  for he was not like us sir used from a by to wombwells showswould redeem many times the number of dull pages or illconstructed phrases that are to be found in theophrastus such nor are there wanting abundant flashes of really terse and well oxpressed reflection elsewhere the political molecule who 1 occasionally sat alone in the same room with his books is not a person to be forgotten there could hardly be a betterput rebuke to cheap cynicism than this  if the human race has a bad reputation i perceive that i cannot escape being compromised anotherthe sea lion plunges and

insufficient attention to form and an insufficient recognition of its necessity it is never likely to be among the most popular of its authors books nor perhaps does it deserve this popularity but still it will be found in all probability very quotable not to say plunderable all the more so perhaps because many of its good things are in their present habit not set off to the best advantage and

francisco they make their report the wreck is put up for auction and then they disappear all this is excellent and excellently told but alas how shortly three chapters only and those at the very end of the book i well on landing carthew hears that he has come into his estates and to prevent awkward discoveries gets an agent to run up the price of the wreck to a fabulous sum it is however secured by the hero dodd and his partner jim who stake their all on the venture naturally suspecting a hidden treasure of opium or gold dodd starts for the wreck in a strange state of detective exaltation here we are teased by a good deal of the usual gaboriau business the discovery of new clues the fitting in of missing links the reiterated pronouncements of the actors that they can make nothing out of it true the secret is well kept because as yet we have not had a word about carthew and his ship though of course we smell blood from the first but it is all the more worrying for that in gaboriau one always guesses about the second chapter what he is after and then the dues are quite easy to remember and one takes a sort of sardonic pleasure in the bungling and sapient wonderment of the poor dear detectives to properly grasp the wrecker you must read itover again for a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse the clues turn out all right in the end when the problem is solved and xoone mr carthew and a totally distinct and separate story till then it is just algebra well this replica of  treasure island ends tamely enough the flyixg scd is disembowelled and sunk but nothing of value beyond clues is found and dodd return to his partner and ruin having thus wound up the second part of the story the authors then set about the beginning how do they piece the head on to the tail  very simply dodd comes into money he is haunted by the mystery he feels a strange a very strange yearning for the unknown englishman who is somehow mixed up in it he knows a blackmailer is on the trail he will take a holiday by following the clues to england and warn the victim he tracks him to paris hears his story and they swear eternal friendship but unluckily we now feel less inclined to emba on a second or shall we boldly say a third  cruise to the same treasure island through the same seas and with comrades not wholly differing from our former crew it is a beautiful voyage most exciting most tragical it is the very cream of the book butit is only an appendix the lat chapter which is called an epilogue is singularly illadvised it assumes the form of a letter to mr w h low whose name is to my ignorance a name only mr stevenson not unfrequently takes a cruel delight in destroying our illusions and throwing cold water on the dying embes of the fire round which he has allowed us to sit here he begins by relating how the other day he came across his friend dodd who of course proceeds to wind up the story by giving the last news of the various characters but why this sudden intrusion of the author in the epilogue  in the prologue dodds story was told to a merchant named havens what is the object of this confused and confusing setting mr stevenson then in his airy coaxing way throws the whole fiction aside and professes to reveal the genesis of the storyhow he and his colleague resolved to work up some incident they heard into a popular cartbeforethehorse detective novel how keenly they appreciated the inherent defects of such a planthe defects which i have just been illustratingand how they hoped to disguise or palliate them by sundry devices but mr stevenson does not beguile me so easily he is no acquaintance of yesterday i have learned to catch the light shadows of feeling which flit across his sunny pages better than he thinks this is no epilogueit is an apology but of all acts an apology is about the most graceful and the most righteous though fools do not think so it mr stevenson were not a little wearied nay disgusted with his excursion into the realms of anical detectivism he would be no longer to my mind the author of prince otto once he has relieved our anxiety by hinting his contempt for the whole business he resumes his reign over us after all he has but done well what inferior hands can do much better but he should not have tried i would not for the world pit myself against a morning governess at compound division or mangnalls questions but to end thus churlishly i too should be but a wrecker and of the graceless literary breed for though mr stevensons last ship steers an unsteady course she carries a goodly freight there are dramatic scenes in this book which he has never yet surpassed and characters which stand out among his best these and other fine things let the delighted reader find out for himself two points only may be noticed from an advertisement i gather that mr lang is most impressed with the character of the captain which captain  there are several if he means nares i cannot agree with him i do not believe in the virtues of wicked men least of all in those of the farwestern cardsharping cutthroat nay why shrink from the degrading confession i believe there is more virtue in one bethesda of sleek anabaptist chandlers and their snoring spouses than in all the gambling hells of the golden gates we meet too many ruffians in the wrecker but one highly elaborated though somewhat neutral character it does present that of dodd the artist nature dragged into the vortex of coarse reality the other point is the grave and subtle satire on american institutions which underlies the fun of the earlier chapters the commercial academy may be an exaggeration but it is an instructive parable possibly here mr stevenson is indebted to others for the incidents and local colour but the style is clearly his own and reveals vet a new phase of his genius y y  literature the wrecker by robert louis stevenson and lloyd osbourne cassells in one of his early essays mr stevenson played with the charming fancy that the conduct of life depends upon skill in literature not indeed wholly but in a great measure it is no light task he insisted to communicate your precise sense of things in set phrase to another man the choice of words the nicety and exactitude of them may fail to impress your companion as you would have him impressed all speech all intercourse by word of mouth or by  hand of write is so much practice of the literary art and human converse is thus encompassed with peril the world was made before the english language and seemingly upon a different design suppose we held our converse not in words but in music those who have a bad ear would find themselves cut off from all near commerce and no better than foreigners in this big world but we do not consider how many have 4a bad ear for words nor how often the most eloquent find nothing to reply from the first this whimsical commonplace has powerfully influenced mr stevenson it has made of him an aesthetic casuist anxious about the veracity of his least word its minutest tone and accent be it a story a piece of criticism an essay in ethics a personal reminiscence or a private adventure each of his words is positively tremulous with its desire to tell the truth since the whole of life is a continuous and coherent affair he refuses to isolate literature in a secluded palace of art or bookworms study he wants to know life upon all sides and he wants to express it upon all sides by the use of words thus it is that his choice of an adjective his composition of a phrase or his disposition of incidents is for him an exercise in good conduct a trial of truthfulness we live in a very rich full world our behaviour in it and out attitude towards it expressed in words comprehend all matters of belief and conduct of modern writers only mr pater shares with mr stevenson this fine anxiety not to play life false by using inaccurate expressions he also whether he write essays or imaginative studies or more formal narratives shows this care for the truth as he apprehends it to mr pater an italian church or a french landscape an ancient liturgy or a classical rite is a thing with definite values of its own a thing with claims and rights towards which he has duties a shipwreck or a walking tour an american man of business or a french artist is the same to mr stevenson the one is more meditative more learned more gentle than the other but both are men who feel the pathos the heroism the living significance of thingsvirgils  sense of tears in mortal things  and brownings  how good is mans life the mere living  how flt to employ all the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy it is curious to reflect that many critics have found in mr pater and mr stevenson two intensely practical humane and sympathetic writerslittle more than unreal eclectic profundities intricacies and extravagances the wrecker contains as it were in solution all the perfections of mr stevenson upon the face of it it has all the stirring romance of adventure which we enjoyed in treasure island it displays two characters with all the impressive fidelity which made alan breck and the master of ballantrae so wonderful it includes episodes and sketches varieties of life such as those in the two books of travel in the silverado squatters and many single essays it has much of that fantastic humour which adorns the new arabian nights it provides us with more of those brilliancies of moral sentiment already so characteristic of mr stevenson the result is a delightful and imperfect book a saturn  farrago in which every reader can come upon something to his taste and no reader feels satisfied throughout the writers explain how it all came about in an ingenious epilogue or apology they determined one moonlit night in the pacific to write a story about the tale of a wreck often the occasion of a rascally romance in commerce  before we turned in the scaffolding of the tale had been put together but thc question of treatment was as usual more obscure we had long been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of though police novel or mystery story which consists in beginning your yarn anywhere but at the beginning and finishing it anywhere but at the end attracted by its peculiar interest when done and the peculiar difficulties that attend its execution repelled by that appearance of insincerity and shallowness of tone which seems its inevitable drawback they determined by a more artistic method by a gradual approach to the story making though chief character familiar from the first among many various scenes to give an air of reality to the central mystery to this end the story flies from muskegon to edinburgh from edinburgh to paris from paris to san francisco before the puzzle of the wreck in the pacific is introduced and to solve that puzzle the story flies from san francisco to dorsetshire and to barbizon where the answer is given the answer takes us to australia the pacific and san francisco once more i do not know that courtesy compels me to accept for literal truth the authors explanation but it is more convincing at least than poes account of his evolution of the raven in his essay upon the philosophy of composition to mr stevensons method are due at once the charm and the defect of the wrecker the charm lies in single episodes the bohemian life of art in paris the bohemian life of commerce in san francisco the splendid voyage to the pacific islands the search for treasure upon the abandoned ship and in certain characters pinkerton the tactless and romantic speculator  nares the brutal philosophical and cordial seaman but the central facts of the story are obscured by the very means employed to make them plausible and natural the story begins and ends with some lack of symmetry and rounded form the last details are told by mr stevenson propria persona in a letter of dedication to a friend it reminds us of scotts intricate prefaces introductions and involved machinery for getting his main story under weigh pleasant in themselves these contrivances do but embarrass the story which they are meant to serve in the present case the difficulties of the narrative are pardonable enough for they help us to realise that variety and richness of life which mr stevenson never wearies of praising it may be objected to this story that it contains episodes of brutal violence murder and bloodshedding which its author presents with a certain callousness if not with a certain gusto but mr stevenson himself supplies an answer by his constant trust in human nature to him every man has some nobility and we are all incomprehensible together captain nares was full of barbarity vanity illconditioned humours but  he won me to a kind of unconsenting fondness lastly the faults were all embraced in a more generous view i saw them in thoir place like discords in a musical progression tu ul accepted them and found them picturesque as we accept and admire in though habitable lace of nature the smoky head of though volcano or the pernicious thicket of the swamp though world is a pageant of vicos and of virtues to be endured by all means to bo enjoyed if may be our vices have something good in them and our virtuos are not all pure dodd though narrator of though story is grossly ungrateful to his strange lovable comrade pinkorton he writes him pages of penitence  wonderful are the consolations of literature as soon as that letter was written and posted the consciousness of virtue glowed in my veins like some rare vintage in though thick of a dangerous storm nares was happy well theres always something sublime about a big deal like that and it lund of raises a man in his own liking were a queer kind of beasts mr dodd bellaire a  shyster or disbarred lawyer with qualms of conscience goes to blackmail an unfortunate man dodd comments i used to wonder whether i most admired or most despised this quivering heroism for evil mr stevenson feels to the full what mr watson has expressed in four lines  momentous to himself as i to me hath each man been that ever woman bore  once in a lightning hash of sympathy i fdl this truth an instant and no more but with mr stevenson this truth is always present and it has preserved him from that easy contempt for whole classes of men which so many brilliant living writers lovo to express it is instructive to compare mr stevensons praise of a free natural life of work under sun and wind and rain with mr kiplings praise of a strenuous rapid active lifethe ona so simply honest and exhilarating the other so merely hitter and exasperating the two writers have something in common  mr stevenson make us interested in such things as a  deepwater tramp limejuicing around between big ports calcutta and rangoon and frisco and the canton river  mr kipling in such experience us loafing from lima to auckland in a big old condemned passengership turned into a cargoboat and owned by a secondhand italian firm yet the interest roused in us by mr stevenson is very different from that roused by mr kipling it is the difference between thn truth of pootry and though truth of bcienco behind mr stevensons writing there is a soul and a heart behind mr kiplings a good memory and a keen eye a detail recorded by mr stevenson has always some human interest it betokens moro than quick observation and mechanical experience it means that mr stevenson has been true to his pleasaut boase that he has never found life wholly dull nud vapid  that his sympathy with ail forms of life and all ways of men has made hint alort to notice the little details which go to compose them this is a brave book as confused as the iliad as adventurous as though odyssey and with no little of though

his part well and much lessens our reirnt at the want of mr seymours spirited hand  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited toy boz london chapman and hall 186 strand wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughterloving mortals these memoirs contain some account of the adventures of mr pickwick the founder and messrs tupman winkle and snodgrass three of the members of the club in search not of the picturesque like dr syntax but of information concerning men and manners for the instruction and edification of the members of the society of course the story is merely a framework in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befell these gentlemen in the course of their travels the comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts and for poetry at least poetry of a serious character we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever to borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the  joy green when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse its a very slight affair and the only excuse i have for having ever perpetrated it is that i was a young man at the time the style of ideas brought into fashion bv monk lewis and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of barry cornwall has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste and consigned to the  tomb of all the capulets  and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of thomas moore are excused only by their exquisite matter or by the kwill which h rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords but such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of longtried ingenuity having thus blamed what we consider blameable it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise the scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause the mind which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein a scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house not a hundred miles from westminsterbridge is well worthy of perusal and in short if we were to particularise all that is good we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest we should reprint half of the contents we give one extract which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the pickwick club and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers shops we have passed for some time since it should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish seymour but since his lamented and premature death they have been of course transferred to another operator the portion we have chosen is a description of the chain of untoward circumstances by which mister weller boots of the

admiration of the easy original and unaffected powers displayed in them we should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome there is no flagging in this number before us every stroke of the writers humour the most common or the most careless tells to a desired effect and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous is thoroughly mastered here we should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the comic tn the heartrending calamities of common life as in its sidesplitting oddities and humours the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled the number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old lawclerk on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old inns of court mr pickwick stares at him in silence the old gentleman resumes with a leer   look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic  what fine places of slow torture

rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject mr pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence  talk of your german universities said the little old man pooh pooh theres romance enough at home without going half a mile for it  only people never tb ink of

magnus  the old un means a turnpikekeeper genlmn observed mr weller in explanation  oh said mr pickwick  i see yes very curious life very uncomfortable  theyre all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said mr weller senior  ay ay   said mr pickwick  yes consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls n deat me said mr pickwick  i never knew that before  fact sir said mr weller  if they was genlmn youd cali era misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pikekeepin all this is excellent but the wit of boz excellent as it is has not exhausted this subject of turnpikes he may return to it with some effect we look upon it as only another strong proof of their misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind that they are specially called trusts because they all declare  no trust it is malice and false pretence the elder mr weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son we will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to sam when he is obliged to resume the reins for london   pm a goin to leave you samivel my boy and theres no telling ven i shall see you again your motherinlaw may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o the celebrated mr yeller o the bell savage the family name dependa wery much upon you samivel and i hope youll do wots right by it upon all little piata o breedin i know i may trust you as veil as if it was my own self so ive only this here one little bit of adwice to give you if ever you no matter and pison to say to that pison yourself samivel my boy pison yourself and youll be glad on it afterwards with these affecting words mr weller looked steadfastly on his son nnd turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight we see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the papers of the pickwick  the posthumous papers of the pickwickian club indited by bo and the library of fiction  or lui utily story teller boz marches on triumphantly and has completely taken possession of the ear and of the hearts too of his countrymen his fifth number is joyous in the scenes of a contested election and the honest wonder and indignation ol the great mr pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming the contents of the  story teller  this month are all good and two of the pieces are original the one jesse chile by miss mitford and  the alchymist by mr harvey this is really a great advance upon the last hoing thus this periodical cannot fail to do well  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club  containing a faithful record of thc perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions of the correspotiding members edited by boz with illustrations the public have now had a full dozen of these papers and they are cager for a dozen more they seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed instead of flagging they grow more uproarious in their fun and more rich in their drollery we like this number the best of any that have yet appeared still it has a striking fault and we shall take this opportunity of reading master boz a friendly lecture in public that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private when he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of everyday life he should always be not only strictly possible but even probable thus if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera we give him a little latitude as to his proportions and the free use of his colours  but should he choose to paint a pig it must be a pig and nothing else but a pig that he paints or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure the trial scene that makes the interest of this volume is as familiar to his readers as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty  and everybody who reads it knows badly as much of our judicature is conducted that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced this is a pity inasmuch as it has no thing to do with the humour of the proceedings if it were necessary for the following out of the story that the venerable and muchtobeidolized pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages the evidence against him should have been made strongerthe misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away however ull this may not have struck the million but we will still maintain that however wild may be the fiction or rampant the humour of a literary production all the groundwork upon which it is erected such as the face of the country the manners of the time and the operations of public institutions should be strictly in accordance with truth  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club containing a faithful record of the perambulations ptriis travels adventures and sporting transactions of the corresponding members edited bv box with illustrations boz iroes on triumphing and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct the seventh number of this pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six the sporting excursion on the 1st of september which was undertaken with all the strength of the club still more strong in its adjutant sam weller is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read the impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow among the pigs and the asses in the tillage receptacle for the wandering is a happy hit and though a most powerful still a most probable one for quiet humour and keen satirical acumen the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed the next number promises us a rich treat wo are just admitted into the vestibule with the foldingdoors partially opened that are to disclose some rich scenesupon which we are impatient to enter  posthumous leapers of the pickwick club containing a faithful pecord of the lramhnhttions perils travels adventures anil sport ing transactions of thc corresponding me min rs tlil iii edited by boz v itu illustrations very good this number the eleventh indeed sam weller improves upon acquaintance the world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular the renowned mr pickwick is himself the legitimate successor to don quixote  indeed he is the cockney quixote of the nineteenth century and instead of armour of iron he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat and instead of spear and sword has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler the wrongdoer and the oppressor of the innocent wc wish that the humorous boz would call to mind that the knight of la mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame we should like to see mr pickwick confess to the soft impeachment this gentlemans attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heartwe trust that it will not ascend to his head but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these pickwickian papers  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited by boz no ix chapman and hall this is the best pickwick we have had the humour is broad rich and effective as usual and there are sharper and nicci touches of character the sketch of  george nupkins esquire the magistrate ol ipswich with all its accessories

prubi bited a pugilistic contest between the middlesex dumpling and though suffolk bantam crummer proceeds with bis warrants to though hotel of the pickwickians and insinuates himself into their

emphaticallya this is a private room sira private room mr grummer shook his head and replied no rooms private to his majesty when the street doors once passed thats law some people maintains that an

magistrate going as dont commit himself twice as often as he commits other people at this sally another special laughed and then tried to look so tuperoatu rally solemn that the magistrate detected him immediately an inimitably humorous passage ensues in which it appears eer tain that the inst named unlucky special must have been committed  only that mr jinks who is the magistrates adviser having bad k legal education of three years in a country attorneys office whispers the magistrate that bc thinks it wouldnt do and so mr nop kins makes a speech and says that in consideration of the specials family he shall merely reprimand and discharge him poor mr jinks afterwards saves the  tremendous mr nupkins from anally committing mr pickwick without a hearing that illustrious maa is

true to nature than these extracts we have given we have great pleasure in quoting this just tribute to geuius from blackwoods magazinebut blackwood bas always had a generous sympathy with talent aod

to show who is privileged to take precedence ofthe author of paul cu ff tr j and eugene aram washington irving no cooper no his name does not occur to us at this moment but perhaps we may find it in the london beview  that posthumous payers of the pkhtrick cm edited by box no 7 chapman and hall this is beyond a doubt the most original and amusing series of comic sketches that have been published in our time and we are inclined to think the present number so far as they have gone the best of them the jest is kent up with excellent breadth of humour and a most studied insight into the niceties and peculiarities of character scene after scene is worked out as if on the spur of the occasion without much appearance of any previous bias or ultimate purpose but always broadly and powerfully and from a rich rein of comic invention the style continues racy and unaffected the writer reminds us frequently in his ingenuity in the vivacity of his talents in the wonderful local truth of his pictures and in the general accuracy of his observation and humour as well as in the ease and animation of his manner of the elder english comedies and farces he has a share of the ludicrous invention of vanbrugh and touch of the higher powers of wycherley the number before us opens with a serious imputation on the character of mr winkie whose friendly attentions to mrs pott the wife of the redoubted editor of the eatanstrill gazette were remarked upon in a previous number as mr winkle is sitting in mr potts breakfast room in all the unconscious simplicity of perfect innocence mr p enters and calls him a  serpent mr w very naturally supposes this to be a piece of pleasantry we recommend what follows to the reader in the hope that none of our contemporaries will suppose its allusions levelled at them   pleasantry sir  exclaimed pott with a motion of the hand indicative of a strong desire to hurl the britannia metal teapot at the head of his visitor u pleasantry sir but no i will be calm swill be calm sir and in proof of his calmness mr pott flung himself into a chair and foamed at the mouth  my dear sir interposed mr winkle  dear sir  replied pott  how dare vou address me as dear sir sir  how dare you look me in the face and do it   well sir if you come to that responded mr winkle  how dare yon look me in the face and call me a serpent sir   because you are one replied mr pott  prove it sir said mr winkle warmly  prove it a malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the independent of that morning and laying his finger on a particular paragraph threw the journal across the table to mr winkle that gentleman took it np and read as follows   our obscure and filthy contemporary in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood to the personal affairs of our late candidateaye and notwithstanding his base defeat we will add our future member mr fizkin what does our dastardly contemporary mean  what would the ruffian say if we setting at naught like him the decencies of social intercourse were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule not to say from general execration  what if we were even to point ont and comment on facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious and beheld by every one but our moleeyed contemporarywhat if we were to print the following effusion which we received while we were writing the commencement of this artiele from a talented fellowtownsman and correspondent    lines to a brass pot   oh pott if youd known how false shed hare grown when you heard the marriage hells tinkle youd have done then i vow what you cannot help now and handed her over to w     v   what said mr pott solemnly what rhymes to  tinkle villain   what rhymes to tinkle  said mrs pott whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply  what rhymes to tinkle  why winkle i should conceive and saying this mrs pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed pickwickian and extended her hand towards him the agitated young maa would have accepted it in his confusion had not pott indignantly interposed  back maamback said the editor  take his hand before my very face ln  mr p said his astonished lady  wretched

mrs pott stooping to pick up the pantr  upon my word sir mr pot winced beneath the contemptuous gate of his wife he had made a desperate straggle to screw op his courage but it was fast coming uasorewed again there appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence  upon my word sir when it comes to be read but the tone of voice io which h was delivered and the look that accompanied it

ingenious young man that sam said mr pickwick with a slight shudder  just was sir replied mr weller continuing his occupation of emptying the basket  and the pies was beautiful we began by describing an imputation on the character of mr winkle and we regret to say that before the number closes mr pickwick himself plays some opening passages in the part of defendant in an action for  breach of promise his visit to the office of messrs dodson and fogg is inimitably toldthe sketch of the clerks is finished adunguem but we must pass these and also the sharp lineaments of captain boldwig and likewise the choice spirits assembled at the magpie and stump for the purpose of introducing the father of mr weller and the scene of his affectionate recognition sam and mr pickwick have turned in for a few minutes to a house of refreshment by way of relief from thc toils of a very anxious afternoon m the room was one of a very homely description and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen for several gentlemen who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession were drinking and smoking in the different boxes among the number was one stout redmeed elderly man in particular seated in an opposite box who attracted mr pickwicks attention the stout man was smoking with great vehemence but between every halfdozen puffs he took his pipe from nis mouth and looked first at mr weller and then at mr pickwick then he would bury in a juart pot as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving and take another look at sam and mr pickwick then he would take another halfdozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again and at last the stout man putting up his legs on the eat and leaning his back against the wall began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all and to stare through the smoke at the new comers as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them at first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped mr wellers observation but by decrees as he saw mr pickwicks eyes every now and then turning towards lum he began to gaze in the same direction at the same time shading his eyes with nis hand as if he partially recognised the object before him and wished to make quite sure of its identity his doubts were speedily dispelled however for the stout man having blown a thick cloud hom his pipe a hoarse voice like some strange effort of ventriloquism emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest and slowly uttered these sounds vy sammy  whos that sam  inquired mr pickwick  why i wouldnt ha believed it sir replied mr weller with astonished eyes  its the old un  old one said mr pickwick  what old one    my father sir replied mr weller  how are you my ancient and with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection mr weller made room on the seat beside him fbr the stout roan who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand to greet him  vy sammy said the father  i hant seen you for two years and better  nor more you have old codger replied the son  hows mother in law    vy ill tell you what sammy said mr weller senior with much solemnity in his manner  there never was a nicer woman as a widder than that ere second wentur o minea sweet cretur she was sammy and all i can say on her now is that aa she was such an uncommon pleasant widder its a great pity ahe ever changed her condition she dont act as a vife sammy  dont she though   inquired mr weller junior the elder mr weller shook his head as he replied with a sigh ive done t once too often sammy ive done it once too often the illustrations are excellent they are quite equal to the best attempts of mr seymour in the early numbers  the posthumous pt

w boz and thc library of fiction consisting of critical fssaijs talcs tad sketches of character wv notice these two works together because together they first appeared and together we are in the habit of receiving them at the beginning of each month but the race is all in favour of the pickwick club elderly though its members be and very obese its renowned chairman and sundry of its members  bo is making for himself a standard fame and this number is perhaps the best that luis yet appeared the witjif these papers is subtle and beneath the surface  their humour is not that of extravagance but of nature the laugh that the author has raised against the strenuous trilling oj antiquarianism is a fair laugh and it is exquisitely excited the whole thing is well clone and we shall say no more in the library of fiction the k diary of a surgeon does not improve  sandie saudeman the piper will be pleasing to a certain class of readers and of the nonoriginal papers we shall say nothing thc redeeming point of this number is tk the sybils stone by the author of the  gentleman in black though the idea has often been worked up before yet it is so pleasantly done that we do not regret its want of novelty we wish well to this periodical and we trust that in its next number it will put forth greater strength even the engravings are infinitely inferior to those of its pickwickian brother  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club by boz nos 1 to 6 chapman and hall as a lively caricaturist the author of these papers may take rank with some of the best comic writers in the language in hitting off the eccentricities of life few have excelled him his style is fresh and racy and has all the stamp of an original spirit the reader will thank us for the extracts we are about to make if he bas not already had the good fortune to meet with thc papers themselves the idea worked out is that of a  faithful record of the perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions ofthe corresponding members of a cockney club founded by mr pickwick  for the promotion of science thc advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning the corresponding members consist of thc illustrious founder himself whose character is sustained throughout with a very romantic gravity and of messrs tupman snodgrass and winkle who are respectively distinguished by admiration ofthe fair sex a taste for poetry and a sporting turn the different parties play upon one anothers failings and into one anothers handsthc plot of their adventures is kept up with infinite liveliness bustle point and interestand many neb sources of the truly ludicrous are opened tne nature of mr pickwicvs observations on the various towns that are visited may be gathered from an abridgment of what he

delicious to those who are extremely fend of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying our next extract is an admirable picture of a family party the travellers have been invited to the house of a goodhumoured country gentleman mr wardle some strokes of character in the following description of the scene of their reception are truly excellent for humour force and reality a very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gownno less a personage than mr wardle s motheroccupied the post of honour on the righthand comer of the chimneypiece and various certificates of her having been brought up ia the way ihe should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk teakettle holders of a more modern period the au ut the two young ladies and mr wardle each vying with the other in paving zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lad crowded round her easy chair one holding her eartrumpet another an orange and a third a smellingbottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support on the opposite side sat a baldheaded old gentleman with a goodhumoured benevolent facethe clergy noan of dingley dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery ot manufacturing homemade cordials greatly to other peoples satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own a little hardheaded ripstone pippinfaced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman n one corner ana two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat biltupright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mr pickwick and bis fellowvoyagers mr pickwick mother said mr wardle at the very top of his voice  ah maid the old lady shaking her head  i cant hear you  mr pickwick grandma  screamed both the young ladies together  ah  exclaimed the old lady well it dont much matter he dont grasping the old ladys hand care for an old ooman like me i dare say u i assure you maam said m r pickwick and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance  i assure vou ma am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well 44 ah  said the old lady after a short pause  its all very fine i dare ssy bot i cant bear him u grandmas rather put out now said miss isabella wardle in a low tone  but shell talk to vou presently mr pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle  delightful situation this said mr pickwick u delightful echoed messrs snodgrass tupman and winkle  welt i think it is said mr wardle  there aint a better ipot o ground in all kent sir said the hardheaded man with the pippinface there aint indeed sirfm sure there aint sir  and the hardheaded man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very muck contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last 44 there aint a better spot o ground in all kent said the hardheaded man again after a pause u cent mullins meadows observed the fat man solemnly u mullios meadows  ejaculated the other with profound contempt  ah mullins meadows repeated the fat man  heglar good land that interposed another fat man  and so it is surely said a third fat man  everybody knows that said the corpulent host the hardheaded man looked dubiously round but finding himself in a minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more  what are they talking about  inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice tor like roany deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself  about the land grandma  what about the land nothing the matter is there  u no no mr miller was saying our land was better than mullins meadows  how should he know anything about it  inquired the old lady indignantly u millers a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him i said so saving which the old lady ouite unconscious that she had

B5928,['6691507'],  the land of pearl and gold by alexander macdonald frgs blackie and son ltd ios 6d net this is a very attractive collection of breezy tales of prospecting mining and travel in and on the coasts of australia in new guinea and other islands pearl is given precedence of gold in the title but in the text there is only one tale of pearl fishing and that is nearly at the end but a pearl is the lady of all gems and so the title is in the best of taste place aux dames mr macdonald tells these sixteen tales in the first person and there is not one that is dull he delineates his characters with force and sympathy and we quickly make friends with many of them  mac the huge scotchman is his constant henchman as loyal as he is selfassertive as tenderhearted as he is fierce morris the gentlemanminer and  new chum whose nerves are so unstrung when his mate  the shadow lights a detonatingfuse in a shaft that he jumps for the rope by which he and shadow are to be hauled into safety and so pulls down the windlassbarrel but having seemingly doomed himself and comrade to destruction his nerve is good enough again and he digs below the burning fuse and cuts off its connexion with the charge see the golden promise mine   the warden  is a resident magistrate who holds the wildest valley of new guinea in the hollow of his hand being feared by cannibal natives and worshipped by pioneer miners to the extent that their first preoccupation was to avoid any action which might involve him with his seniorshappily a no uncommon type among those in whose hands lies the honour of the empire at its outposts see  men of the yodda valley and there are many others whom the reader will not forget though many fortunes are made in the gold and other mining fields too seldom alas  does the pioneer or bona fide miner slam the cream he has many dangers and difficulties to overcomephysical dangers of fatigue fever and thirst the enmity of the aboriginals the wile of the mining chinee these produce a stirring tale in  white black and yellow when threatening black men preparing a great corroboree are attracted to the camp of no less hostile chinamen and one enemy disperses the other but the canteenkeeper and the sharper are almost the worst enemies of all and the tactics by which a good find must sometimes be secured to the pioneer is humorously told in  how we held mackays find on a colonial coaster which tells of of a voyage round australia sounds a little improbably rough and haphazard  but  a sugar expert deserves notice a mining engineer is pressed into visiting the sugarplantations of the bardekin delta and spends a bewildering two days amid hospitality and culture resource and cultivation he finds sugar and sago pineapple and vineyards all thriving and a planter who invents anything from a showerbath to a flyingmachine and whose steam sugarcutter is to solve the great difficulty of labour for the kanaka is no longer to be admitted and white labour unions are fast making planting a losing game a blank cheque is offered the miner for a report as a  sugar expert which is never filled in mr macdonald describes scenery with an artists pen and he is nowhere happier than in  the pearling grounds when he donned the divers dress and went down to a coral reef i stood in the midst of a magnificent marine forest where graceful coral branches intertwined with less material tendril growth the fronds of the coral palms trembled as if in a gentle breeze and the more robust growths swayed slowly to and fro and so we will leave mr macdonald but well above water  the land of pearl and gold  will be always a welcome companion to those who like to read of men doing mans work in the wilds,biography

about seventeen who had been sitting by her a youth who appeared a year or two olderstepped forward and saluted ralph as bis uncle   ohgrowled ralph with an illfavoured frown you are nicholas i suppose  that is my name sir replied the youth   put my hat down siid ralph imperiously will maam bow do you do you must bear up against sorrow maam  i always do   mine was no common loss said mrs

said nicholas with a glance of indignation  yes sir and puppies mid pugdog likewise replied his uncle taking a chair  von didnt mention in your letter what my brothers complaint was maam  the doctors could attribute it to no particular diseasesaid mrs nickleby shedding tears  wo have too much reason to fear that bc died of a broken heart  pooh  said ralph theres no such thing i can understand a mans dying of a broken neck or mi henna from a broken arm or a broken head or a broken leg or a broken nno but a broken heart nonsense its the cant of the day if a man cant pay his debts lie dies of a broken heart and his widows a martyr j  some people i believe have no hearts to break j observed nicholas quietly j  how old is this iwiy for gods ake  inquired ralph wheeling hack hi chair and surveying his nephew from head to foot with intense scorn nicholas is iry nearly nineteen replied the widow   nineteen eli  said ralph  and what do you mean to do for jour bread sir  not to lise upon my mother replied nicholas bis heart swelling a he spoke   youd have little tuouidi to live upon if you did retorted the uncle eying him contemptuously whatever it be said nicholas hushed with anger  i shall not look to you to make it more   nicholas my dear recollect yourself remonstrated mrs nickleby  dear nicholas pray urged the young lady  hold your tongue sir said ralph  ipoa my word kine beginnings mrs nicklebytine beginning     well maam said ralph impatiently the creditors have administered you tell me iind theres nothing left for you    nothing replied mrs nickleby   and you spent what little money you bad in coming all the way to london to see what i could do for you pursued ruph  i hoped faltered mrs nickleby that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brothers children it was his dying wish that i should appeal to you in their inhalf   i dont know how it is muttered ralph walking up and down thc room  but whenever a man dies without any property of his own he always seems to think he luis a right to dispose of other peoples what is your daughter fit for maam   kate has been well educated sobbed 31rs nickleby tell your uncle my dear how far you went in french and extras  the poor girl was about to murmur forth something when her uncle stopped her very unceremoniously   we inut try and get you apprenticed at some boardingschool said ralph  you have not been brought up too delicately fur that i hope   no indeed uncle replied the weeping girl  i will try to do anything that will gain me a home and bread   well well said ralph a little softened either by bis nieces beauty or her distress stretch a point and say the latter  you must try it and if the life is too hard perhaps drcs3making or tambourwork will come lighter have you ever done anything sir turning to his nephew   no replied nicholas bluntly   yn i thought not 1 said ralph this is the way my brother brought up his children maam  nicholas bas not long completed such educacation as his poor father could give him rejoined mrs nickleby and he was thinking of  of making something of him some day said ralph the old story always thinking and never doing if my brother had been a niau of activity and prudence he might have left you a rich woman maam  and if he had turned bis son into the world us my father turned mc when i wasnt as old as that boy by a year and a half he would have been in a situation to help you instead of being a burden upon you and increasing your distress my brother was a thoughtless inconsiderate man mrs nickleby and nobody i am sure eau have better reason to feel that than you   are you willing to work sir he inquired frowning on his nephew   otcourse i am replied nicholas haughtily then see here sir said his uncle this caught my eye this morning and you may thank your stars for it  with this exordium mr ralph nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket and after unfolding it and looking for a short time among the advertisements read as follows   ian ivrionat mr wackford squcerss academy dotheboys ibill itt the delightful village of dotheboys near ireta bridge in yorkshire youth are boarded clothed booked furnished with

daily from one till four at the saracens head snow hill nh an allie assistant wanted annual salary ot  a master of arts would be preferred there said ralph folding the finner again let him get that situation and his fortune is made  but he is not a master of arts said mrs  nickleby   that replied ralph that i think can be got over   but the salary is so small and it is such a long way oil uncle  faltered kate the scene nt thc saracens head on snow hill is in the best pickwick manner here is the schoolmaster from the picturesque neighbourhood of greta uridge   mr squcerss appearance was not prepossessing he hid but one eye and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two the eye he bad was unquestionably useful but decidedly not ornamental being of a greenish grey and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door the blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up which gave him a very sinister appearance especially when he smiled at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations his hair was very flat and shiny save at the ends where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner he was about two or three iind titty and a trifle below the middle size he wore a white neckerchief with long eadsandasiiit of scholastic black but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long and his trousers a great deal too short he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable  mr squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffeeroom fireplaces titted with one such table as is usually seen in iotfeerooms and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition in a corner of the seat was a very small deal trunk tied round with a scanty piece of cord and on the trunk was perchedbis laceup halfboots and corduroy trousers dangling in the airi diminutive boy with his shoulders drawn up to his ears and his hands planted on his knees who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster from time to time with evident dread and apprehension  halt past threemuttered mr siiieersturnb from the

nothing sir exclaimed mr saucers   please sir i sneezed rejoined the boy tren hiing till the little trunk shook under him oh sneezed did you  retorted mr squeers then what did you say nothing for sir  in default of a better answer to this juevaon the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry wherefore mr spicers knocked bini off the trunk with a blow on oin sule of his face and knocked him on again with u mow on the other wait till i get you down into yorkshire my young gentleman said mr saucers and then iii give you the rest will you hold that noise sir

thousands that of l pickwick papers without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent it establishes though claim of thc work to

slice of herein the next than the cibbers of our own after regaling themselves with a squeers or a smike or a newman noggs or a vincent crummies in number six have been for other slices of them in number seven this shows us at the outset a great secret of the popularity of the author he seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality isle thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand our sympathies are never left to wander off into quarters vague or undefined from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them and this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or i w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so in everything of that kind that he presents to us there is in his manner of doing it the manliness and simplicity of nature or the truth of life as it is we are never repelled by the abominations of egotism conceit or dogmatism we are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule if there is good going on there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty  and if there is evil it runs no chance of being mistaken for good the quantity of invention observation and knowledge of character observable in tl writings of mr dickens is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion now by all the various readers of this tale of nicholas nichlebyand they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each otherthese various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt in this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces  them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them this is a test which only a man of genius could bear it is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low in regard to the customs and usages of life are so revealed for it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity than by the alliances of common habits that we are all linked together the highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other peoples opinions these are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in incidentally they embrace many others his style is for the most part admirable bating some faults of occasional exaggeration which we may presently advert to it is fresh and racy and has the surpassing charms of simplicity earnestness animal spirit and good humour a rare virtue in it is that it is always whether grave or gay thoroughly intelligible and for the most part thoroughly natural its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos it is a quick as warm as comprehensive as the sympathies it is taxed to express we know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet or iltostfate mot happily

streets in some cold and ogy morning while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour yet were it oay for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears distantly and indistinctly as though the o had muflicd them we could not doubt that it was london we enter with him by night through long double rows of brightly burning lamps a noisy bust lim crowded scene in which he shows us the rags of the squalid balladsinger fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmiths glittering treasures and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men add this is the same london as before at all times and under every aspect bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms we come to know better the very places we have known best wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in golden square thc saracens head on snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality the alphonse of cadogan place reveal themselves plain bills to our practised eye  and the sight of even a real butterfly fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless city square startles us no more and with all these masterly requisites for his art is mr dickens a perfect novelist by no means he has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story without which that rank can never be attained he has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration to which though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the pickwick papers he is still too prone in saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him it is a due compliment to such a writer to assume that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together the great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot we need hardly observe is fielding for exquisitest contrivance for happiest extrication of story he stands quite unrivalled in this respect tom jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last which docs not more or less tell upon the story while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc gents by which its results ure to be worked out thus black george is scarcely a less essential personage than tom jones himself and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine each in his own peculiar sphere to one grand effect its only episode the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on is that of thc old man of thc hill introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of cervantes and le sage passing this there is not an eddy a current scarcely a single ripple on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art nicholas nie kleby could not stand such a test for an instant a want of plan is apparent in it from the first an absence of design the plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers instead of having been mapped out beforehand the attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recall us to the main interest and action admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect art the consequence of it is in this case that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on though writer and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters needful indeed to a gathering up of the loone or broken threads of an imperfect story but sounding more like the minute recitals of a lawyers deed than the natural development of a book of so much originality

this kind we are not certain even that the more amiable characters of the book are always so amiable as we are desired to suppose them and we must confess an insuperable aversion to the heroics of nicholas nickleby himself when as it happens sometimes they obscure even his strong and gentle mind we take him to cut a poor figure for example in that quarrel with our dear mr lenville how ultraexquisite saving only that are all the scenes with the strollers 1 and when he stalks out nf the green room  bowing slightly to the assembled company we long to have been there notwithstanding our seldomvarying strong affection for him to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit we can scarcely reproach ourselves for this we are not sure that even mr dickens himself is indisposed to quiz now and then these little foibles of his favourite hero it is we remember after a certain sort of hasty demonstration of them that one of the helpers at thc saracens head is heard to exclaim  hallo this is somebody in disguise this is and another follows up the joke with  room for the eldest son of the emperor of roosher iienlimn but when we follow the son of the imperial potentate into bis little dark and deserted room when we see him in his tender devotion to poor smike an always touching and most beautiful feature in the story w rought too with consummate art when we are with him in his lonely thoughts of sister and home all other vagaries are forgotten and nothing is visuie to the moistening eye save the simplicity and sweetness of his nature we have only to make one exception more we referred to it when we spoke of some exaggerations in mere style mr dickens occasionally overlays his thoughts with needless epithets and is over profuse in his use of adjectives it is only in his reflections we find thisand that rarelyin his descriptions never and now having hastily glanced at objectionable points in the conduct or treatment of this famous story what a host of beauties crowd on our grateful recollection for which we have not opportunity or space to give even a passing glance to with what pleasant thoughts it has stocked our memory with what true and tender sentiments enriched our hearts with what a healthy and manly moral instructed our minds with bow much vivid distinctness each character takes its place before us how plainly we pee the individualities of each the form of their faces the accident of their habits the nicer peculiarity of their minds these are triumphs which on i j belortg to a firstrate writer the creative powers of the novelist when properly directed and well sustained take rank with history itself the mchylus of parson adams is not less real than the spectacles of burke the trumpet of sir joshua or the snuffbox of gibbon in

their full and satisfactory achievement we hope that he will not fail in this great is the glory though the strife be bard and heartily do we wish him strength to surmount the one and long life to

B4134,['6643455'],  little journeys to the homes of good men and great by elbert hubbard g p f utnams sons it must be confessed that mr elbert hubbard has selected a most unfortunate title for his book it has about it a distinct flavour of the young mens christian society and conveys to the literary reader an entirely false impression of the nature of its contents as a matter of fact these twelve essays are particularly free from faults of the kind their illchosen title suggests jejune they are not neither are they amateurish indeed it is not to praise them too highly to say that they are free from conspicuous faults of any kind we receive another check in attacking the book almost immediately we open it it was a mistake to couple george eliots name with shaksperes treating the two as equals it was a mistake too to assume that george eliot occupies the place among women conceded by all the world to shakspere as a man it is true that when we challenge ourselves to instance her superiors we feel somewhat confused but this only emphasises the fact that at present at all events it is ridiculous to assume that in the aggregate there is anything like equality between men and women writers however we may let that pass it is a small fault and it is almost ungenerous to mention it as we dip deeper into mr hubbards pages the simplicity and grace of his narrative compel confidence he has the true instinct of compression and the skill to seize essentials he paints pictures for us with the directness of a degas but he infuses into them the idealism of a millet he tells the story of mary ann evanss association with george lews with sympathetic insight and completeness nothing extenuating and setting nought down in malice his description of hie stay at warwick of though inn there and of his walk over to nuneaton is written with cameolike distinction the present writer has made the same pilgrimage and in doing so he has communed in spirit with the essayist the writer next takes us into the company of thomas carlyle and his wife herein he shows that ho possesses the gift of sympathy and iosight into the complexity of human character i have never read a more understanding story of the relations between these two  jeannie welsh carlyle writes mr hubbard  bad oapacity for pain as r seems all great souls have she bufferedbut then suffering is not all suffering and pain is not all pain and again  his carlyles was a masculine mind the discrimination and subtle intuitions which are k found to be scattered through his pages like t violets growing among the rank swale of the prairies all these sweet odorous things came from his wife she gave him her best thoughts and he greedily absorbed and unconsciously wrote it down as his own the excellent taste of mr hubbards brief biography makes it of more value than many ponderous tomes written about carlyle the picture of john ruskin too if as vivid as it is characteristic incidentally it must be remarked that in this essay mr hubbard is betrayed into indulging in some cheap and inconclusive remarks on the nature of genius and on the position of the woman married to a man of genius his premises are wrong and bis deductions are false and the several examples upon which he bases his contentions are absolutely without point mr gladstones picture has been so often drawn that mr hubbard could not be expected to make his version of that manysided man stand out he gives us however an excellent sketch of chester and of a wellknown hostelry there but mr hubbard is at fault in speaking of lord brougham as a scotchman he prefaces his eulogium of turner wiih that sentence of ruskins which is more remarkable for the generous wholeheartedness of its praise than for its critical accuracy to speak of any work of turners as incapable of any improvement conceivable by the human mind is simply to descend into rhapsody however the responsibility for this extravagance may be born by mr ruskin the tale of turners early struggles is told with sympathy and knowledge for a long time his pictures were not popular  first the public says mr hubbard scorned turner next turner scorned the public in the beginning it would not buy his pictures and later it could not    for merit there is a recompense in sneers and a benefit in sarcasms and a compensation in hate this essay on turner is among the most illumined of the series  if swift says mr hubbard had possessed only his mothers merits without his fathers faults he would never have shaken the world with laughter and we should never have heard of him in other words no man is supremely great unless he has a dash of the devil in him and swift is certainly a striking example of this truth  his misanthropy as the writer remarks  defeated his purpose thwarted his ambition ruined his aims andmade his name illustrious for think what a small meed of fame would have been his had he achieved the summit of his desires and been enthroned as primate of england the profession of letters was hateful to him he despised it social precedence was his aim even more than political power the last was in his eyes a passport to the first but swift had not the patience to wait his stomach was too high to permit him to crawl into the office he coveted 4 to succeed in winning a bishopric requires a sagacity as keen as that needed to become a governor of new york the man bides his time makes himself popular secures advocates lubricates the way pulls the wires and slides noiselessly into place as a churchman swift was an erastian of the purest type he was as mr hubbard says  as incapable of spirituality as he was of the grand passion not an amiable man assuredly a man to respect perhaps but not to love frond severe cruel calculatingthere were no bounds to his ambition the philosophy which comes with years did not serve to allay the smart of his bruised and wounded spirit he was of the earth earthy a materialist and so far as essentials go a sceptic his undying literary creations wera evolved to give vent to his spleen that swift wai congenitally mad his recent biographers see fit to deny but to the present writer the denial seems to be based on grounds which only pedantry can accept his overweening vanity was the outcome of incipient madnees of which indeed it was a symptom mr hubbard tells a characteristic story of victor hugo what he had once written  down beelzebub and all his hosts could not make him change at a rehearsal of  hernani mlle man expressed a dislike to rn certain word and asked the author to change it  i wrote it and it must stand was his answer but mlle mars persisted in using another expression instead of the authors whereupon hugo asked her to resign her part the lady wept promised to adhere to the text and was reinstated fiftythree times thereafter she played the part and she did not once speak what the author had written  the moral of this is that even a strong man cannot cope with a small woman who weeps at the right time the next two essays those on wordsworth and thackeray are less effective thousands of pens have written about dickens but bis works and his haunts have rarely been treated more luminously than by the writer under consideration it would be difficult to commend too highly his lightness of touch or the philosophic tolerance with which he deals with his subject and in estimating dickenss place among the novelists of all time mr hubbard is as critical as he is just  the novelist says he  must have lived and the novelist must have imagination but this is not enough he must have power to analyse and separate and then he should have the good taste to select and group forming his parts into a harmonious whole it must be admitted that mr hubbards defence of dickens against his severest critics is scarcely convincing he tacitly admits that many of his characters arenot really alive but only seem to be  by rummaging he says  over the commercial world you can collect the harshness greed avarice selfishness and vanity from a thousand men with these sins you can if you are very skilful construot a ralph nicklcby a scrooge a jonas chuzzlewit an alderman cute a mr murdstone a bounderby or gradgrind at will a little more pride a trifle less hypocrisy a molecule extra of untruth and flavour with this fault or that and your man is ready to place up against the fence to dry mr hubbard discourses on dickens admirably and entertainingly and he says some acute things on his own account he thus sums up his qualities and limitations 44 he has a watch that starts in a way of its own never mind the sun he lets you see the wheels go round but he never tells you why the wheels go round he knows little of psychologythat curious unseen thing that stands behind every act he knows not the highest love therefore he never depiots the highest joy nowhere does he show the gradual awakening in man of godlike passion nowhere does he show the evolution of a soul very very seldom does he touch the sublime but he has given the athenians a day of pleasure and for this let us all devoutly give thanks after dickens goldsmith about that wayward son of genius mr hubbard writes entrancingly he takes us through the land of his birth in a coach and fourthe good steeds of fancy sympathy charity and ehilosophy and when he leaves goldsmith e takes up his parable again with shakspere then he makes his bow and we are sincerely sorry jas stanley little,biography

schooldiscipline would it is reasonably supposed have opened the youngsters eves but no not even his acquaintance with the watchdog the bull and the beehive while robbing an orchard to the fruit of which in arguing the point he claims an equal right with the owner nor his ducking in the fishpond when caught poaching on a neighbours property are sufficient to convince master jack of the untenableness of his position the theory of equality not being satisfactorily proved on land as far as his experience goes he determines to try its truth at sea and he accordingly asserts to his father his right on the principle of equality of determining his own profession the  point is argued and jack prevails by influence with a captain fortunately for jack under pecuniary obligations to

length of saying with one of our great men that he who would make a pun would pick a pocket but we detest puns except after dinner when a few glasses of wine have made us very amiable and easy to please written puns are absolutely intolerable need it be said that such wretched traps for horselaughers are quite unworthy of the acknowledged talents of captain marryat i but a much graver charge is that of representing the roman religion and its priesthood in an odious light such bigotry is now quite pase and can only serve to disgust the intelligent reader and injure the captains credit the most rabid orangemen could not paint more revolting scenes than are here given of the foul conduct of the romish priesthood the author may have his own opinions on these matters and we will not argue the point but we question the good taste of dragging them before the public in a work of fiction those of our readers who enjoy hearty merriment must read these volumes  mr midshipman easy literature notices of new works by the author of  peter simple  ja cob faithful c 3 vols this is a beautiful personification of a principle a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown as in a multiplicity of mirrors hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity had mr midshipman easy existed he must per force have acted precisely as captain marryat has made him act and that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service all who know that noble service will testify though the midshipmen kanya who have appeared on his majestys books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this mr midshipman easy par excellence occupies in captain marryats we have given in a long extract in our preceding number a specimen of what this exciting novel is it was the opening of the tale and with the sliest humour and in the blandest style covereel the most hiting satire of this almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit of which not one two but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force the paternal mr kasy having allowed his goodnature to run to seed which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania carried out even to the agrarian law anel a community of goods becomes as such a person infallibly must a madman abroad and a tyrant at home though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow the expression is pretty though a little used and something sharper than thorns elsewhere and everywhere else he still follows it out as all other democrats do until it interferes with his own convenience and at length notwithstanding the junior easys assertions to the contrary the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school this part of the story which is not at all maritime but strictly natural and highly amusing will be found philosophical also now the embryo mr midshipman easy inherits from his worthy father a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent this leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations out of which he always extricates himself with glory owing to the sound principle upon which he always acts of taking things easily should he be on the horns of a bull or of a dilemma no fear for master easy he will contrive to lip himself off softly from the one without a broken bone and to extricate himself honourably from the other by making an easy cushion between them from which to combat his adversary but as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united like the roman conquerors of old they resolve to divide the world between them old easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth vonni kasy all those who reside on the waters with a shamefully ample allowance the latter goes to sea as a midshipman then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence thc reader may suppose that at first in endeavouring to take all things easy he of that name finds it goes hard with him no such tliintr he is imperturbable command him he argues the case and produces his minorreprove him he argues the case still and produces his majorwell he is still unconquered  then to wind up the debate his superior officer proceeds to punish himbut he is not beaten  he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises and ultimately proves himself to be in the right by taking his punishment easily but the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall with all his whimsies do himself great honour and his country some service by mr easys maimer of thinking and acting he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel but his many droll and highly interesting adventures gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles by teaching him that in this ever shifting world everything will ultimately find its own level worth and activity rising vice profligacy and stupidity sinking to the depths of their natural degradation lu fact mr easy though always liberal becomes very gentlemanly and a good tory leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed  for mr easy senior not having been to sea to gain wisdom goes on from bad to worse from the whimsical to the extravagant and from the extravagant to thc insane all this part of the tale is a melancholy but a true picture of our fallible natures the love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of madame de staels aphorism that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man but captain marryat has contrived to make his midshipmans episode a very exquisite one the naval scenes as usual with this author are glorious the storm the fight the imminent danger are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master the delineation of the various characters that act with mr easy are also first rate what a troop of creations has this writer called forth we will not use the cant of criticism and say as that cant too frequently does this is the last and best of his works it is not better than  peter simple nor better written than  jacob faithful or a more true picture of life as life really is than  japhet in search of a father each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself which excellence could not by any possibility belong to the other midshipman easy is inferior to none of captain marryats preceding works  we think that the world will prefer it to any of them  but this preference ought not and will not throw his other productions into shade we shall conclude our remarks by saying that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country not merely originated one to be improved by othersand the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas over which we hope that england may be for ever triumphant,biography

since a modest volume of poems entitled  the souls destroyer appeared the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken the book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of william h davies we learned just enough to whet our curiosity we learned for instance that the new poet was a onelegged man who lived in a common lodginghouse somewhere in southwark that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s a week and that most wonderful of all he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense this sounded promising  but like oliver twist we wanted more at length mr davies has taken pity on our ignorance he has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life and a marvellous record it is  in these days incident having deserted the region of fiction is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary certainly  the autobiography of a supertramp we like not the title by the way it is too slavishly shavian contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by say mr rolf

of considerable practice has acquired the difficult art of begging his companions have been thieves vagrants and mendicants not since borrow it seems safe to say have we had a presentment so vivid forceful and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people and the strange thing about it all is that mr davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts a lover of the

davies refused to disgorge a cent the remainder must be told in his own words  judge stevens looked at us steadily for a time and then asked this astounding question boys how much are you prepared to pay brum who had very little sense of justice and being such a good beggar set very little value on money asked the judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us if i had been alone at this time i would have paid nothing but to save brush from going to prison who i knew would support me through all i satisfied myself that if the judge approved of this amount i would pay it without further comment the judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously and then cried with a magnanimity that was irresistible  pass over the dollars boys  you shall have a chance this time as a record of a

B6865,"['6721267', '8736364']",  literature more leaves from the journal of a life in the highlands from 1862 to 1882 smith elder  co it is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be the twenty years with which the journal has to do was indeed an eventful period it was marked by such important incidents as thc francogerman and russoturkish wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves but with these matters the journal is altogether unconcerned it deals solely with the queens life in the highlands and though it is quite natural that her majestys subjects should wish to know what were the queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it it records no thrilling adventures a carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the journal offers to its readers the interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective we look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her as a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray though selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect an art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic and the special value of the queens journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour in these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects it is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the queen is so fond of scotland this book answers the question it is because there and especially in the highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity the queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of though house of stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors heredity asserts itself mr galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone for we arc insensibly reminded of king george iii farmer george when wo read the queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping but although the journal recounts the queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied but we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern the book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author charles j robinson  more leaves from the journal of a life in  0f the highlands from 1862 to 1882 btf literature  tn smith i crq elder  co   j th from a purely

will find a responsive echo otherwise o the experiences recorded are not altogether 1 such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character t the book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen it affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare but it is e its simple human interest that gives the  hook its strongest appeal the reader rises  from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learned something more of the good  i woman by whom it was writtenthat above all else he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be born by all to whom it comes how will the queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of st pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the queens consort had died at windsor this book contains the answer to that question its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope of the queens personal character the volume contains naturally enough many indications that character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will it was so in those early days of her sovereignty when lord melbourne told the queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could eve happily i for long without a mans arintb rest on and when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero this womanly trait is obviously a key to the queens intimacy with dr norman macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered though tribute of an i abundant gratitude a keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that principal campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of though statue of the prince consort at aberdeen when it rained in torrents in other places the manifest sincerity saves everything the book contains some few indications of the queens taste in literature we gather that she is a warm lover of scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the duchess of saxecoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell scotts stories  to prince albert and his brother the  queen herself appears to be familiar with scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j we are told that brown gave her a copy of the poems of the ettrick shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things it is said in various places that lady churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books this is to be regretted though anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure a similar silence is observed with respect to the queens tastes in the arts wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte that her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence it is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is though sole business of the book to present but while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the queen must have thought and written frequently the following passage on a visit to abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to abbotsford the wellknown residence of sir walter scott it lies low and looks rather gloomy mr hope scott and lady victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present duke of norfolk with their children the young duke of norfolk and some other relations received us mr hope scott married first miss lockhart the last surviving grandchild of sir walter scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of sir walter they showed us the part of the house in which sir walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his ms of ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx sir walter had himself collected then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of sir walter in the study we saw his journal in which mr hope scott asked me to write my name which i felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others we went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are sir walters last clothes we ended by going into the diningrcom in which sir walter scott died where we took tea in this connexion it may be mentioned that when the queens uncle and early guardian leopold king of the belgians travelled in scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the princess charlotte he was for a few days the guest of sir walter scott at abbotsford while there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way an aged scotch divine alluded to the fact that though king was descended from frederick the wise elector of saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the reformation and to become a protector of martin luther thereupon leopold said that he felt more honoured by though mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay the relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the queen herself says in these  leaves of the strong protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of scotland her majesty s love of the highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment that she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough above all things the queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to carlyle goethe was the first to say  come let us make a description it will be remembered that the passages of the queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her majestys visits to poor highland women there was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to though queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman the present volume contains two such peep into highland life and the one we quote fresents us with though last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow grant on sunday august 22 1869 i went to see old mn grant whom i was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and i fear dying of dropsy on august 20 i again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way i took her hand and held it on the 27th she died on the 28th i stopped at her cottage and went in with louise and leopold we found all so clean and tidy but all so silent mrs gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death she had on the socks i gave her the day before yesterday she was in her eightyninth year probably the most enjoyable of these  leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the highlands here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep at a quarter to twelve i drove off with louise and leopold in the waggonette up to near the  bush the residence of william brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep this is a practice pursued all over the highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man james brown my shepherd though elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then william and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry to the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tyre and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough a very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping it was a very curious and picturesque sight more pathetic is the following  tuesday june ll 1872  brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time i was dreadfully shocked it was the child of a man named rattray who lives at cairnnacraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper abercrombies house not far from monaltrie farmhouse in the street at a little before five set off in the waggonette with beatrice and janie ely and drove along the north side of the river we stopped a little way beyond tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest they were searching everywhere while we were there the ol grandmother catenach by name who lives at souttar hole came running along in a great state of distress she is rattrays mother we drove on a little way and then turned round we heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at monaltrie burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below mrs pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the dee this burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen the little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the dee and carried along too dreadful  it seems from what i heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one we drove back and up to mrs grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  wednesday june 12  drove up to the bush to warn mrs william brown never to let dear little albert run about alone or near to the burn of though danger of which she was quite aware she said her husband william had started off early at three this morning some people went down to abergeldie and as far as the girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle no word of the poor child being found all were to start early to search that the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the queens domestic life in truth her majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment so long ago as the year of the queens accession the marquis of londonderry writing to the duke of buckingham said i hear melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection thia fact her premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience that these  leaves contain much moro about mr john brown than about lord beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise the book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers naturally enough brown became essential to the queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy it is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of browns robust independence and simple usefulness we do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship ,biography
B3175,['6815004'],  father and son a study of two temperaments heinemann this anonymous book is one of the most fascinating and interesting pieces of literature that has been issued of recent years were we not in the preface to it specifically informed that the narrative  in all its parts     is scrupulously true we should have judged it to be fiction by a skilled hand founded upon fact and personal experience but either way as unadulterated fact or unadulterated fiction it is as the author offers it to us a document of the highest value though strangely enough not so for the reason advanced by the writer who claims that it is a  record of educational and religious conditions which having passed away will never return  a diagnosis of a dying puritanism this stifling joyless creed is neither dead nor dying it is today a power in the land indeed a prominent puritan not long since urged upon us that it was the backbone of the nation and was not a little annoyed when we retorted that if so  the nation was suffering from spinal disease the puritans we have always with us and their creed admirably summed up in the following quotation is the same now as it was in the beginning it divides heart from heart it sets up a vain chimerical idea in the barren pursuit of which all the tender indulgent affection all the genial play of life all the exquisite pleasures and soft resignations of the body all that enlarges and calms the soul are exchanged for what is harsh and void and negative it encourages a stern and ignorant spirit of condemnation it throws altogether out of gear the healthy movements of the conscience it invents virtues which are sterile and cruel it invents sins which are no sins at all but which darken the heaven of innocent joy with futile clouds of remorse there is something horrible if we will bring ourselves to face it in the fanaticism that can do nothing with this pathetic and fugitive existence of ours but treat it as if it were the uncomfortable antechamber to a palace which no one has explored and of the plan of which we know absolutely nothing the book is the story of the struggle between two temperaments the fathers and the sons the father is a plymouth brother of the sternest strictest blindest type the mother who dies while the son is yet a child is equally fanatical for example to her every work of fiction is simply a lie the father is a zoologist of high standing and considerable fame not a little troubled for a time by the contradiction of genesis by science the mother bequeaths the son to her husband as one of the lords anointed and as destined to devote his life to the propagation of extreme puritanism the remainder of the book is devoted to the mental autobiography of the sons boyhood and youth all the characters are drawn with extreme skill and the picture of the small group of brethren in a little devonshire village is pitiable in its accurate dissection of narrow bigotry and selfsufficient blindness is not this a perfect touch this point concerning the father and his praying aloud over the son  i cannot help thinking that he liked to hear himself speak to god in the presence of an admiring listener these folk love to be familiar with the deity without the slightest intention or sense of irreverence there are revival scenes too painted soberly and with unfailing accuracy but we cannot follow our author when he sets forth that he is depicting a dead past fanaticism and puritanism vary in externals from age to age but in essentials remain the same we have neither space nor would it be profitable to attempt a detailed analysis of the book it must be read to be understood and appreciatedbut we will give one more quotation a passage which seems to us to sum briefly and ably a great subject it will i suppose be admitted that there is no greater proof of complete religious sincerity than fervour in private prayer if an individual alone by the side of his bed prolongs his intercessions lingers wrestling with his divine companion and will not leave off until he has what he believes to be evidence of a reply to his entreatiesthen no matter what the character of his public protestations or what the frailty of his actions it is absolutely certain that he believes in what he professes various famous men flit across the pageskingsley huxley robert louis stevenson sheridan knowleshistoric events play their part and had we the inclination the writers claim to be a narrator of fact could easily be checked but as we have said it boots not whether the story is fact or fictionit is true to life the author also challenges the reader to  recognise him as an old acquaintance occasionally met with in quite other fields the secret has not been kept for long and we understand that mr edmund gosse does not deny that he is the writer of the book it is a great book but for our part we scarcely like this close anatomisation by a son of a father,biography

B3323,"['4842116', '8528390', '8470921', '4361330', '9461784']",  review of current literature sylvias lovers three vols post svo j smith and elder 1863 whatever defects may be justly imputed to the present age the most prejudiced praiser of past time would hardly grudge to it the tribute of having excited in the minds of all classes a preeminent sense of the claims and interest in the fortunes of the poor we may be less full of enthusiasm than our fathers the rapid progress of luxury may have made us more selfindulgent than they the relaxa tion of authority may have made us less reverent but we have a sense of respon sibility in our dealings willi the poor as a body nnd consequently of interest in their condition which is altogether a new thing the world of addison and fielding and pope is in this respect a different world it is not that uneducated people do not play a large part in the novels of fielding for instanceperhaps larger than would be thc case in the same kind of novel at the present day but they are strictly accessories their ruggedness is only brought out to set off the polite life in subordination to which they are all arranged this is true to a considerable degree even of sir walter scott and miss edgeworth who both be long unquestionably to the new age they linger over their sketches of the lower orders with a far more loving pencil than they bestow on the more elaborate portraits of their superiors in rankbut it is the latter after all which form the centre of j the picture that this rugged life can be an object large enough to engross the canvas to itself is the discover of our own day to us it appears that the reaction against eighteenth century gentility has been in some directions excessive and we should as much regret that all writers of fiction should draw their materials from clay hovels and crowded back lanes or even from farm houses and shops as we should that all educated women who arc without the re sources assigned to them in popes hack neyed line should devote themselves to visiting the poor still it cannot be denied that a fiction representing the life of uneducated people has certain advantages over one equally good in which the subjectmatter is different the aim of literature and especially of fiction ought to be the enlargement and elevation of sympathy the cultivation of a catholic interest in all nonmoral differences of character and life for this object it is well that we should be sometimes taken out of our own atmo spherethat we should look at the pro blem of life under those simpler aspects which it wears to those who are hemmed in on every side by its humbler necessities this is a very desirable result and the power of producing it is rare few edu cated people really know the poor and still fewer can translate that knowledge into fiction when we say therefore that the novel here noticed is one of the very best of this kind we award it no slight praise it will somewhat unfortunately we think remind most readers of mrs gaskells only rival in this field but though we cannot think it bears any approach to the rich and vigorous colouring of the author of  adam bede in the outline of an interesting plot which we have thc selfdenial to refrain from extracting the superiority lies with it  sylvias lovers although we look upon it as a better novel than marv barton will not for several reasons share thc popularity of its predecessor some of these reasons might be reckoned by many among its merits those who re member the state of feeling with regard to the relations of labour and capital fifteen years ago will not doubt that some part of thc very lively interest excited by though novel of manchester life was due to its entanglement with a complex problem of thc day but critics who believe all adventitious interest of this kind to be as dangerous to the effect of art as a ct stripe of bright colour running across a beautiful pattern who doubt whether problems of this kind are a good field for the powers of womennay who feel quite certain that novels are not a good occasion for discussing such will find with un mixed satisfaction that mrs gaskelfs last novel opens no issues of this nature our attention to an interesting and pathetic story is not carried out of the picture as it were by any introduction of an element foreign to art mrs gaskells last novel is moreover very superior to her first in the absolute exclusion of all gentility she keeps on her own peculiar ground from the beginning of the book to the end and those feebler touches which her vigorous style iii dealing with favourable material brought out so forcibly in her earlier novels are  thereby avoided the quality of the novel  which will we imagine most detract from its general popularity is its exceeding  painfulness this in itself is neither good j nor bada tragedy cannot bc too tragic j but wc do not find all that in a very pain  full story we unconsciously demand thack j cray had a good right to give us a novel  without a hero but a novelist who takes  us into the dark recesses which only a few  human beings are called upon to tread j owes us the compensation of a central j image of large and lofty proportions ex j celling not necessarily in virtue but in j energy in elevation in strengthowes us  in short the relief of poetry as it is denned j in the noble words of bacon the use j of this feigned history hath been to give  some shadow of satisfaction to the mind in j those points wherein the nature of things j doth deny it    a more  ample greatness a more exact goodness  and a more absolute variety than is to be foundin the nature of things he con j eludes but wc would alter it to  the j nature of man here our author fails she does indeed j leave a large space for her central figure and spend much pains in the elaboration of his portrait but the conception is feeble and the execution indistinct philip hep burn is sylvias lover and nothing more take from him the love which leads him into the basest perfidy and which there fore eminently needs the background of a rich and glowing character and he becomes a mere blank while his wife is drawn with so much force and soliditv that the extreme flatness of his portrait tells like a false note we cannot help comparing him with adam bede and the difference of the two im pressions of character is thc differencebetween a name written on loose sand and one engraved on a gem thc dashing young sailor whose gallantry wins him a cap taincy is a stock novel character it is true but the superior crispness and de cision of execution so far compensates for the commonplace ideal that we timi our selves regretting at every turn that he instead of his uncouth and yet insipid rival does not occupy the place of honour in the story this is the capital flaw in the book and it is to our thinking something more than an artistic flaw hepburn is so evi dently intended to interest us on the moral side of his character that the absence of any remorse for his treachery apart from the fear of and regret for its consequences strikes us somewhat painfully and though the occasion demands the exclusion of ali bitter feeling we yet are somewhat revolted when his wife repenting of what seems to us her righteous indigna tion against him laments him with the words  oh philip my philip tender and true f mrs gaskell is too much inclined to confuse the sharp line which divides those temptations which are and are not possible to a character she intends to retain its hold on our respect nevertheless the story has a noble moral put in the mouth of the dying philip child he said i ha made thee my idol and if i could live my life oer again  i would love my god more and thee less and then i shouldnt have sinned this sin against thee this is the keynote of the book but to give it full effect the character j of philip should have been altogether dif ferent miltons division  he for god i  only she for god in him might be owing  to a low conception of the womans ideal  but to sacrifice honour and duty for one i beloved object is the womans temptation 1 and the character which is to yield to it j and vet retain our sympathy should retain  the attraction of a somewhat feminine  grace this the uncouth shopman is entirely and desijmedlv without and loses i thereby as much in an artistic as in a mond j point ef view we have dwelled too long on the one great 1 want of a story whose excellence forces us i to try it by a very high standard to do j more than indicate very slightly either its  few remaining defects or its many lesser merits our favourite passages are those fresh country scenes where we seem to  breathe the pure dewy air of the georgies though there are not wanting passages of great vigour as for instance the description of the lire  which will excite more general admiration we cannot reckon the scene at the storming of st jean dacre among these but it is the only too ambitious passage in thc book we regret this failure the more as the author might easily have spared us this journey to palestine and back by merely giving a letter actually tjuoted when we have added that thc first half of the first volume is very de cidedly inferior to the rest and that there is a superficial resemblance to george eliots hetty in the heroine which is quite lost sight of as we advance we havo noticed almost everything we regret in a book the merits of which could not be exhausted in a much longer space rumour assigns a vcr similar plot as a subject for the labours of the laureate we can hardly expect even from him a more pathetic rendering of it the delineation of in dividual character is not the forte of our author but she has wisely chosen a subject in which her almost unequalled power of painting the character of a class and those deeper emotions which bring out not what is individual but what is universal has enabled her to give us a fiction which will take

girl was not kinraid too fickle to be true to sylvia even if he lived through the war and did return  philip would say nothing till he returned to monkshaven and when he did return kinralds hat had been found on the water no pressing had been seen in the neighbourhood and all thought kinraid dead was it not better thought philip that a man like kinraid should thus die out of sylvias hie and leave open for her thc way to his own great deep j earnest love the message was not delivered  thc pressgang came afterwards again into those parts  at shields it was riotously fought against and for

prudent wife to have thc warming pan taken down for his special comfort and when he was got with aching bones between the warm sheets he thanked sylvia and her mother in a sleepy voice adding its a vast o comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleeping in  their own homes this night and then slumber fell upon him and he was hardly roused by bells softly kissing his weatherbeaten cheek and saying low  god bless thee  my man thou was allays for them that was down and  put upon1 but the burning of the inn was hanging matter in those days and honest daniel was hanged for it mrs gaskell doea not describe either the trial or the execution after daniel robson has been carried to the county jail we hear only of the home from which he has been wrenched of the love that yearns to him and labours for him a single fine touch indicates the completion of the tragedy behind the scenes and in those days who so firm so true so gentle as philip so sure a support to the widow who gropes for her lost husband through a darkened mind so true in love to sylvia philip and coulson have been made by the kindly fosters their successors in the shop haytersbank must be given up philip and sylvia

girlish illusion for the gay  specksioncer when she weeps by the deathbed of the grave longfaced shopkeeper who had proved himself the better hero although the less brilliant and the nobler lover though his love had stooped to one unhappy breach of a trust thrust on him against his will the end of the book is like the burden of some truehearted old ballad tale and in its whole substance there is not only the refinement of plot that contrasts so forcibly with the coarse fiction now in request but also a charm of style and a poetical conception of detail that leaves the reader when he closes the book with such memories as might be carried from a gallery of choice cabinet pictures but in a former notice we have expressed our sense of the general character of this welcome addition to the sterling literature of our day now therefore we will leave the book to be read by all who desire better entertainment than is to be found in the bad grammar of mrs henry wood and the coarse kitchen literature of miss braddon the graceful and shrewd humour of mrs gaskells cranford lives again in the first half of sylvias lovers the character painting is throughout exquisite and the picture of trouble at haytersbank consequent upon daniel robsons fatal arrest has been equalled in pathos only occasionally by the best masters of fiction how cleverly mrs gaskell manages the dialect she has

reads a poem its plot is of such a tale as crabbe might have chosen for his verse and although written in prose it deals among simple and unfashionable people with the truest poetry of life in thought feeling and action every incident hi alive with subtle tooohea of humour or pathos and in ita harmony of colouring the skilful grouping of ito characters and the quiok sense of life and nature shown in ita minutest detail stands before the reader as a picture by a sterling artist mrs gaskell has never written with mon care than in this novel the yorkshire dialect of nearly all the dialogues is so skilfully managed that without being a stumblingblock to any reader it gives the charm of a doric simplicity to the whole idyll the shrewd character painting the incessant blending of the sights and sounds of nature with the action of tip story the spirit of kindly human fellowship and the high sense of human duty belong to the unaffected english of the narrative itself rich in fresh thought and true refinement of expression were the story of the book poor it would be commended by the manner of the telling in its whola texture sylvia lovers is as lawn to sackcloth compared with the coarse  sensa tion  tales of late forced irtfjmlion which produce a striking plot as one might jfrotoe a striking pattern by daubs with a tar brush on the millers sacking in story as in style the oontrast is complete in sylvia lovers though strong interest is excited and none who have tears for an imagined grief will pass with dry eyes through the closing chapters either of the second or of the third volume there is no bigamist no murderer no villain at all there are the shortcomings of human weakness common to us all the lesser conflicts of character wherein no small part of all human life consists but there is not a person in the book of either sex who does not accredit the sound doctrine at which they who live healthily must needs arrive in their mature years although ito evidences are not clear to youth that men and women are good fellows in the main the true artist shrinks from nothing so much as the mere dull reproduction of deformity crime of course must be always a common element in tragic narrative but then it must be introduced not for its own sake but as an active power through which souls are tried and the great depths of mans nature may be stirred a great crime establishes among a group of surrounding persons strong exceptional conditions of life exceptional because it is below the common nature of men to be greatly criminal the true poet novelist or dramatist uses the crime not as a condition interesting in itself but as productive of conditions under which the spirit of man shows in its strong emotion forces that would in repose not be apparent the objection against such books as 4 lady audleys secret apart from the fact that they show only the coarsest sense of literature in their writing is not that they are tales of crime but that they are illwritten talcs of sordid crime of crimes meanly committed for poor sneaking ends and dilated upon for their own sake as interesting matters of concealment and detection writers of such books would make a  sensation novel of  goneril out of the play of  king lear add regans share of cruelty to gonerils cut out cordelia reduce lear to a  softy and make him creep under his daughters bed with a lighted chambercandle all the stir of emotion that can be produced by a great crime mrs gaskell has obtained in sylvia lovers without the production of a criminal there is great iniquity but it is the iniquity of an abstraction relentless powerful impalpable as the fate of a greek tragedy iniquity of law mainly in the activity of the pressgang among the seafaring men of coast towns during the war with france at the close of the last century and subordinately in the undue severity of penal law at the same date we are reminded that there was no deliberate wickedness in the motives that maintained at that time in great vigour the system of impressment and that backed it with the strong arm of the law those persons concerned in execution of the law who appear in the tale are represented only as men with the same kindly sympathies as their neighbours but the evil law is the dread shadowy fate against which hearts beat and souls chafe in vain today we only express an opinion of this tale but we shall return to it and justify it fully  reviews of books sylvias lovers tie success of adan bede and its successors attestcd the oss1bility of a delineation of peasant

whole story is to disappoint those who remember the g low with which they followed mrs gaskells earlier romances to their novuewent and the firstrate artistic ability displayel in the compilation of such a biography as that of charlotte ilronte for one thing  sylvias lovers  is eminently an  unsatisfactory novel the goodnatured inclination to make everything co righlt in the long run and to believe that this is after all the best of all possible worlds is absolutely set at naught the book is full of gratuitous suffering nor does the conclusion leave us any reason to fancy that when the dark cloud of tragedy has drawn off the mournful landscape will be in any material respect altered for the better the chief incidents upon which the tale turns are as old as the history of storytelling a serious sentimental youth falls desperately in love with a flighty girl who after leading him for some time along the stony path of adverse courtship proceeds herself at last to fall desperately in love with a roving rmarine don juan whose personal charms and audacious behaviour make him secure of feminine conquests wherever he conies upon this primitive foundation the whole superstructure of the tale is raised and as the scene lies at the close of the last century the authoress has the opportunity of interweaving sone capital pressgang stories and the execution of a man for riot which are the real backbone of the book novelists who wish to be effective always stand in need of a grievance and the political position of england at this period of her history involved many grievances of the most serious description no more tyrannical interference with the liberties of the subject has probably ever been attempted than the 1 arbitrary impressment of sailors for the royal service and nothing but the desperate struggle in which england was engaged could be i held to justify a measure which hurt niutch and terrified even more than it hurt that it often resulted in intolerable hardshipthat it entailed dreadful sufferingsthat it roused a furious spirit of discontent and disloyalty among the classes whom it principally affectedmight be conceived without the aid of mrs gaskelis vivid delinieiation but in no part of the story are her powers so thoroufhly aroused as when she describes the several seizures of the monkhaven fishermen the fights which resulted therefrom and the miserable doom to which through their instrumentality a simple wellmeaning old man was brought it is in resisting one of the raids of the pressganc that kincaid the hero of the piece first makes his appearance and nothing can be better than the description of the sort of charm which the prestige of personal bravery and a desperate wound received in opposing a supposed outralre invested him in the eyes of an impressible passionate and enthusiastic girl a nation stirred to its depths by a worldwide struggle dazzled by great military achievements fretted by oppressive laws is far better material for the novelists purposes than the uninteresting prosperity which in modern times drives the framers of fiction into the invention of imaginary grievances and chequers their pages with tragical catastrophes too wildly impossible even for the most willing and eager credulity real life then is full of real tragedy and the most faithful delineation of its incidents is the most artistically effective mrs gaskell seems to have felt this and to have bent herself assiduously to reproducing the actual state of feeling and mode of life among the seafaring population of the northern coasts at that time education thoughtfulness morality were it is needless to say all widely different from what they are among ourselves very worthy heads of families indulge in frequent

palestine to rescue another hero his ideadlyenemy under a heavy fire of artillery we should take it as oa matter of course and neither wonder nor complain  but whent the hand which depicted rtuth descends to such commnonplace trivialities we feel disposed to murmur at the eccentricities of talent and in behalf of the authoress no less than of the public she hab iso often delighted to warn her against forgetfulness of the first principles of her art and against negrlect of those true natural types upon which all genuine art is necessarily dependent  sylvias lovers new novels by mrs gaskell 3 vols  smith elder  co the story of  sylvias lovers is laid in humble life and is narrated chiefly in the broad vernacular yorkshire dialect which although it gives the local colour is a drawback to the comfort of the reader and fatiguing to the eye but for true artistic workmanship we think sylvias lovers superior to any of mrs gaskells former works the scene of the story is laid at a fishingtown on the yorkshire coast called here monkhaven the time the close of the last century when the war with france was rife and pressgangs were in all their cruel authority monkhaven was the seat of the greenland whalingtrade and the best scene in the book is the description of the return of a whalingvessel the first of the season waiting to get over the bar all the inhabitants assembled in breathless excitement to hear news of sons brothers husbands and lovers who had sailed on the toyage just as she clears the bar and gets in the pressgang is upon her seizing halfadozen of the crew and carrying them oft to the rendezvous without allowing them a word with their halffrantic relations waiting and watching for them it is a highlywrought scene and yet there is not a trace of straining for effect or of exaggeration it is true pathos and relies only on the simple truth of the reality sylvia the heroine is the daughter of a retired whalingsailor who has become a farmer but who still loves whaling and smuggling far better than ploughing or seeing after sheep and cattle old daniel robson is a capital portrait sylvia is as charming and pretty a damsel as ever tormented the heart of a lover  but she has a dash of fierce persistent resentment in her character that effectually redeems her from perfection the mother is an excellent and skilfullydrawn charactera respectable sensiblereligious woman whose one inconsistent act had been the choice of her husband but she behaves so wisely and well that it would have been a pity to deprive her of such an opportunity to exercise her virtues sylvias cousin philip is desperately in love with her against all his sense of prudence for he is as wise and excellent and disagreeable a young man as can well be imagined there is no fault to be found with him except that he is detestable sylvia hates him and the reader sympathises with her heartily and yet he never does anything but good nor says anything but what is unexceptionable he loves sylvia with a remorseless pertinacity which affects the reader with a positive dread it is so certain to tyre down all opposition and wear out obstacles of course he suffers a great deal and the reader feels a malignant pleasure in every rebuff he receives he is a man who can talk of the respect due to the law to the poor people who are driven wild by seeing the pressgang carry off their relatives as they touch the hind in one of the returning whalers which the pressgaiig boards a young man distinguishes himself by his resistance and gets nearly killed  in fact there are several lives lost in the affray this young man is the type of a fine highspirited sailor sylvia exalts him into a hero he tells tales of adventure which would have won desdemona herself he falls in love with sylvia and though the mother favours philip and does not like charley circumstances are however propitiousthe father gives his consent and the two plight their troth but they have to part immediately for he has to join his ship a whaler he is the best harpooner in all the service on his road he is seized by a pressgang in the sight of philip to whom he gives a message for sylvia philip never delivers it lets her believe him dead sees her breaking her heart and only thinks of the steadilyincreasing chances for himself to win her mrs gaskell tries very hard to furnish him with redeeming traits of character and to make excuses and to get up the readers pity for him but quite in vain poor old daniel the father gets mixed up in a riot and a rescue from a pressgang in which a house is broken into and destroyed for this he is committed to york castle and takes his trial is condemned to be hanged and the law takes its course this part is tld vaguely and feebly mrs gaskell does not let her sympathies go with the poor old man and she shrinks from this part of her narrative  it is hastily huddled over after this terrible catastrophe sylvia and her mother are left helpless and alone with no one to assist them or protect them but philip who has certainly been a good friend in their trouble sylvia marries him for the sake of a home for her mother the real genius of the story now begins nothing can be more true and delicately indicated than the cold disappointed married life of philip the treachery he has practised begins for the first time to weigh heavily upon him his punishment lies in his sin even the reader feels sorry for him of course charley killian comes home and sylvia learns the truth there is a very strong scene excellently done the fierce unforgiving side of sylvias character comes out towards her husband she has by this time a ehild this and her sense of honour enable her to refuse to leave him but he cannot stand her wild contemptuous indignant misery  he leaves home and in ti fit of reckless despair enlists for a soldier and never lets his wile know what has become of him years pass by and the triumph of mrs gaskells art is shown in her power to bring over the sympathy of the reader to philip charley goes away and makes a fine marriage he has risen to be an officer and become so prosperous that the reader cares no more for him philip saves his life but he meets with no success himself he is in a terrific explosion and scarred maimed and disfigured so as not to be recognized he is sent to england and discharged his deep passionate love for his wife remains all unchanged but he dares not return to herthe memory of her curse lies heavy on him the reader not only forgives him but the intensest sympathy is roused for him we will not spoil the readers interest by narrating the end of the story it is very finely worked up and is as true as it is powerful when once the reader has got over the provincial dialect and the peculiar orthography there will be nothing more to find fault with,biography
B4035,['8621966'],  the hand of ethelberta thc hand of ethelberta by thomas hardy in two volumes london  smith elder and co if you asked anybody during the progress of mr hardys novel through the cornhill how they liked the story you generally received an uncertain and qualified answer all admitted that it was very clever and original not like any other novel they had ever read but most people added that they thought the character of the lady as well as her adventures too improbable they would not believe that such a woman ever existed or could exist and granting the possibility of the character there were many of though incidents which struck them as extremely unlikely departures from the course of real life improbability has been the main fault alleged against the  hand of ethelberta in current criticisms of the story now we have always been among the enthusiastic admirers of mr hardys work recognising in it the very highest artistic purposes and something not far short of the highest powers of execution and we venture to think that this accusation of improbability as a fault proceeds upon a misapprehension of the writers intentions we do not of course presume to dictate what is to be considered probable and what improbable this is eminently one of the points on which a critic has no right to interfere between the novelist and his reader and would find no profit in interfering the reader may always legitimately decline to take any critics opinion as to what he ought to believe to be possible and if the reader pronounces a story improbable and declines on that ground to approve of it the novelist has failed he has failed that is if he intended to produce an impression of probability here the critic in the exercise of his chief function of discovering and explaining the intentions of the novelist may lawfully intervene if the novelist did not intend his story to be a reflex of real life he cannot be blamed if it is not unless we are to lay down  close adherence to the probabilities of real life as an indispensable condition of novelwriting mr hardy seems to us to have deliberately disclaimed being tried by a rigid standard of probability when he adopted as the subtitle of his work a comedy in chapters true there is a comedy of manners in which to be improbable is to fail because its design is to produce an illusion of real life it has recently been argued in these columns that probability is one of the tests by which the comedy of manners is distinguished from the farce but there is another sort of comedy what may be called ideal comedy in which the fancy is permitted to range beyond the limits of real life mr hardys  ethelberta  a comedy in chapters is a comedy of this sort characters and incidents are deliberately and consistently deflected from the perpendicular of real life to gratify the humour of the comic muse the incidents in  ethelberta are improbable as the incidents in shakespeares comedies are improbable it is a work of art pervaded by a dominant sentiment which colours every incident and every character whatever maybe thought of the interest of ethelberta as compared with  far from the madding crowd it certainly shows no falling off in intellectual force there is not a trace of hasty work in  ethelberta  its dialogues its descriptions its general proportions are as thoughtfully calculated and firmly worked out as a dutch painting of the old school not that the novel is dull and laborious on the contrary it is full of life and spirit bright all through with the sunshine of humour and fancy the novelist has been at pains to conceal his painstaking and has succeeded but mr hardy undertook a difficult task in trying to work out such a conception as the character of the heroine ethelberta  he burdened himself with a very subtle and intricate psychological problem the startingpoint of the story he gives in a brief formal prologue in the first chapter younp mrs petherwin stepped from the door of an old though popularlnn in a wessex town to tike a country walk by her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen  but as a fact not generally known her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood she was a respectable butler s daughter and began life as a baby christened ethelberta after an infant oftitle who does not come into the story at all having merely furnished to ethelbertas mother a means of occupying herself as head nurse she became teacher in a school was praised by examiners admired by gentlemen not admired by gentlewomen was touched up with accomplishments by masters who wero coaxed into painstaking by her many graces rather than by her few coins and entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof was stealthily married by the son he a minor like herself died from a chill c night during the wedding tour and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by sir ralph pethcrwin his unforgiving father who had bequeathed his wealth to his wifo absolutely these calamities were a sufficient reason to lady petherwin for pardoning all concerned she took by the hand the forlorn ethelbertawho seemed rather a detached bride than a widowand finished her education by placing her for two or threo years in a boardingschool at bonn latterly he had brought the girl to england to live under hvr roof as daughter and companion th1 condition attached being that ethelberta was never openly to recognise her poor relations this is the lady whose hand is the subject of contention throughout the book if mr anthony trollope had been commissioned to trace mrs petherwins adventures in search of a husband he would probably have contented himself with bringing out in a series of clever descriptions of mrs petherwin in society that her varnish of gentility was only skindeep that the heart of the butlers daughter beat beneath the elegant garb of the fine lady and he would have found in this plenty of material for an entertaining comedy of manners but mr hardy has chosen another line he drops the question of ethelbertas manners on one side with an understanding that they were as perfect as if her fathers vestibules had been lined with ancestral mail and sets himself to the more intricate task of tracing how ethelberta threw overboard various lovers and made up her mind to accept the suit of a profligate old lord there is not much difficulty it will be said in that nor indeed would there have been if mr hardy had written from the point of view of the cynic a marriage of love renounced for a marriage of convenience is a very commonplace affair but the peculiarity aud originality of mr hardys conception lies in the motives which he assigns for ethelbertas choice and his mastery of the novelists art is shown in the skill with which he traces the working of contending motives if the  hand of ethelberta had not appeared before  daniel deronda mr hardy might have been accused of borrowing his method under great variety of character and circumstances from  george eliot ethelberta is a character in which passion is ruled by judgment she was not incapable of passion but reason clearsighted calculation of consequences had the upper hand a talent for demureness under difficulties without though coldbloodedness which renders such a bearing natural and easy a face and hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by nature turbulent as a mave is a constitutional arrangement much to bo desired by people in general yet had ethelberta been framed with less of that gift in her her life might have been more comfortable as an experience and brighter as an example though perhaps duller as a story such a character is dangerous the most cruel monsters the most shameless adventurers are often made of such materials if ethelbertas judgement had been occupied solely in controlling her turbulent impulses to her own advantage her biographer might have had to record a very unlovely career but she was not a selfish woman though she did read bentham and slightly pervert his teaching the sentiment of family was stronger in her than the sentiment of self in the prologue which we have quoted it is said to have been a condition of lady petherwins patronage of her daughterinlaw that she should not recognise her poor relations now it was by no means with goodwill that ethelberta temporarily yielded to this condition the old butler her father had a large family of whom ethelberta was the eldest and her ruling motive in life to which every other was subordinated was the advancement of her brothers and sisters she had all a parents interest in them she was eager enough for distinction and social homage but she was resolved to put her whole family in a position of independence this was the source of all her difficulties aud the source we should think of many difficulties to the novelist if ethelberta had been a solitary adventuress her fortunes would have been much easier to trace the death of lady petherwin removed her necessity for living separate from her poor relations and at the same time imposed upon her the necessity of earning a living by her own exertions for lady petherwin and she quarrelled before the old ladys death and she was cut off with nothing as a basis of operations except the lease of a house for three years in a fashionable square it was no easy task for a woman to make a living and at the same time keep her position in society but ethelberta contrived not only to do so but also to keep all her family by her side the shifts by which this was managed the mental struggles ofthe heroine during the three years for which her fashionable residence was at her command and the grounds of ber final decision are invented and imagined with the most unfailing humour and a very sure insight into the mysteries of the conscience to lay bare the framework of mr hardys story in this analytical way would bo doing him an injustice if we did not say that his framework does not lie on the surface in this respect his art is very much higher than george eliots he traces motives with a skill not less sure and patient but with a much more perfect concealment of the process there is a freshness and sunny clearness about his work a definiteness of outline a bold play of fancy which recals in some indefinable way through all though difference of incidents and characters the air of the elizabethan comedy mr hardys carefulness in construction and regard for dramatic unity is worthy of ben jonson himself there is no straggling in the novel in every chapter it is the disposal of the hand of ethelberta that is in suspense the connecting thread is slight but it binds thc parts very firmly together from whatever point of view we regard the work we find deliberate artistic aims and unflinching fidelity of execution one of the most striking features is the way in which pictorial effects are interpenetrated with the action giving every chapter something like the vividness of a scene in a play we are not only told what the personages say but we seem to see the gesture with which they say it and the furniture or the landscape round them whether this is altogether commendable in a novel whether it does not tend to impede the course of the action and generally dull the impression of what is said and done by imposing too constant a strain on the pictorial faculty of the reader is a subject for consideration but at any rate it is interesting as an experiment we doubt whether ethelberta possesses though popular interest of some of mr hardys previous novels and so far that is a fault or at least a disadvantage to which the novelist must reconcile himself but it is more masterly as a work of artit reveals a progress in technical excellence which makes us look forward with curiosity to his next publication,biography

B7067,"['8940843', '2440875']",  princes8 helene von racowitza8 auto i biography translated from the ger i man by cecil mar constable  co princess helene von racowrtzas autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of george merediths novels and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of the tragic comedians in the memorial edition of his works it is now rather more than thirty years since the princess published that account of her relations with lassalle upon which meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained his explanation brilliant and masterly as it was omitted a very important factor after all the strangest action of the heroine of the story was not her submission to her familywhich had it been the action of one of his own heroines meredith would conceivably have praised nor yet her marriage with the luckless yanko for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion and a somewhat too com placent champion of her own part in the affair clotilde the princess as meredith represents her would have been both too astute and too selfconscious to have committed this astounding blunder but the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked lassalle whether the countess hatzfeld would have to live with them an incident omitted by mere dith who no doubt thought it an in vention of the princesss and the first thing to recognise about clotildes original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing in a spirit of in genuousness verging upon fatuity  this she writes of her present volume ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child the autobiography then convinces us that the story of  the tragio comedians like that of another lady of high distinction for wit and beauty curiously enough merediths next is to be read as fiction  nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them though not a few are discoverable the whole course of the princess helenes life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with clotildes she was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous dashing manner and she went on her way vaguely drifting spasmodically candid playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures it accepting these in whatever form they offered themselves with open arm while still a child she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life and carried them into practice bw she submitted formally to her parents choice where suitors were concerned s0 that on meeting lassalle when she va nineteen she was the typical  jeune file allemande incapable of selfdirection and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility durng the short period of her engagement to lassalle she wanted she says  to tell him all about my past life and my crimes against saintly morality  but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand no no for heavens sake dont let us have any pompeian excavations   and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the autobiography the pages that treaty of lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume but even without them it would be worth reading so great is the variety of the writers experiences her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed she handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence with the support of course of her exuberant vitality that she adopted at need or was ready to adopt the professions of actress physician artist journalist in turnnot without success or some promise of it in all she was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination and took up flower  painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time indeed there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writers practical ability and common sense it is not less remarkable though less engaging that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth the conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to lassalles death a narrative sincere and poignant but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks is puzzlingly absurd the gigantic edifice of the german empire must always she writes have seemed like a prison  to lassalle  i therefore ask whether we pigmies all of us were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny and need gthe spirit of the worlds history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the empire it is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is a theosophist who published anonymously some years ago a little book entitled wie ich mein selbst fand her accounts of the many notable persons with whom she has come into contact from hans andersen

B630,"['4618505', '4991985', '4337431']",  ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchen make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word  you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us  im not going to said 1 somewhat testily  the tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor the religiomin seltiments wvhich the authoress puts into fjit itiouth of her heroines are either false ayjdl lld r so vagute autd unnvanuing as to add to thfe miircality oft hle seclles msithout in

experiences owing nothing to other books to preconceived opinionsstereotyped conventions or the idle chatter of the clubs and coteries a book which expressesfaultily it may be but sincerelythe mind and soul of the author something individual and apart our english literature which has produced many great classics contains few such books as this and they are the more valuable for their rarity it is a selfconscious age and absence of selfconsciousness is of the very essence of yoi pawlowskas art a certain simplicity alike of expression and of feeling is everywhere apparent our author has wandered through europe and into the warm mysterious lands of the near easta solitary pilgrim but she has looked upon men and women upon small smiling cities and vast barren plains with an observant and sympathetic eye everywhere she has found something in which to delight and she has discovered for herselfwhat we all profess to believethat there is a certain quality called  humanity  whioh binds together in an indissoluble fellowship the peoples of the world this book is full of the joy pf life of the mere delight in living one feels that each moment brings with it for the author its appropriate gift to be perfect to the present momentis not that as pater taught us the secret of happiness  and yoi pawlowska is always in harmony with her surroundings whether kneeling before the dim altar of some gothic church chatting to an unknown companion in a railway train or seeing night with the tombs and dawn with the mountains  from the appian way soshe takes from lifegladly and with gratitudeall that it has to give and when she writes of  the gaiety of forest life the haunting shade of leafy valleys the laughter of running water the little cries of surprised wild things the joy of wood flowers and the glancing of sunlight on green moss through trembling branches  one is sure that these thingsseen and unnoticed each day by every one of ushave for her their message of beauty and consolation  to quote is almost an impertinence for no isolated passage can convey any idea of the delicate charm and fragrance of the whole but listen to the reflections of yoi pawlowska as she views rome in the moonlight from a roof garden i move to the parapet and sit on it trying to realise all that eome has done all that she will yet do i whisper her name softly  roma roma she is as beautiful now as when neros palace crowned two of her hills she does not age because she assimilates all that conies to her becomes part of her or it cannot exist and all that belongs to her is in some ways somehowgood  perhaps our critical faculties are dormant in great love certainly here we like what elsewhere we should find blatant and noisy she is great noble splendid what does it matter if that with which she clothes herself is sometimes glaring to our eyes p she can never be vulgar her personality is too great her simplicity too childlike she is no illusive fairy but agoddess carved in mountains free to the sky no pitiful comforter of the weak and the unfit no friend to the moral or physical degenerate but she thrusts a bar of steel into the hands of those who can fight she is a

sorrowing mother sees hope in the death of her son this  year of strangers  will not be exhausted by the first reading it is not perhaps a book for all readers bnt there are many who having once read it will return to it continually as to the companionship of a tried and trnsty friend  a year of strangers by yoi pawlowska duckworth  co 5s yoi pawlowskas name is new to the literary world but those who read her book will not forget it these sketches are like the music of debussy the simple unaffected literary style has that intangible undefinable quality which is in the dancing of anna pavlova with the same elusiveness the same tender halfsad halfloving strains in it the same vivid colour touches written in an admirable english some of the sentences have a queerly foreign twist and this adds to rather than detracts from the charm of the book about which there is something infinitely pathetic and though there is no pathos in it once more we realise that for every real bit of art there is somewhere a broken heart each sketch has in it a momentary lifting of the veil on the deep recesses of a soul washed white by tears each is the work of a dreamer with the heart of a child who has been face to face with the evils of life and has found beauty there is in all this an atmosphere new to literature many have written of their travels but no one has written quite like this before here and there we find terse bits of realism true and little understood things about men and women written by one who has proved perhaps the biggest of all truthsthat there is very little difference in the feelings of the two sexes that men as well as women are often irresponsible and unpractical even hysterical that women as well as men can be true to each other have a sense of honour and can if needs must stand alone if the common want of all creatures is a love which understands everything we have only one critical bone to pick and this is with the proof reader who has left the printer to his own

B9054,['6734679'],  the celtic twilight men and women dhoula and faeries by w b yeats lawrence  bullen it was math the magicianthe same math that formed the maiden blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today mr yeats is perhaps the one true follower of math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his in it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of oisin and cuchulain and if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his the celtic twilight will still remain to the saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and fairies will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before but to those who believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,biography

thanks to its publishers he has become one of the saints df the library as well as one of the worlds novelists his canonization is complete  the last honours have been bestowed and his reception into the hierarchy is an accomplished fact he need no longer be read in the blunt type and blurred pages of murphy and chalmers nor in the pale ink and yellow paper of original editions nor in the dogsears and meagre margins and dreadful double columns of popular reissues the greatness now thrust upon him is at once impressive and engaging in his new guise he appears as one of the handsomest and noblest classics in the language with so much to praiseand justly praise it seems ungraceful to condemn the edition has been projected on so opulent a scale and is in certain ways so complete and honourable a success that to find fault with it at all is to run the risk of appearing hypercritical and even unjust on reflection however it is impossible to reject the conclusion that the enterprise is remarkable rather for liberality and enthusiasm than for taste and judgment to begin with the size of the volumes raises objections and objections that are neither to be gainsaid nor despised fielding is before all things else a writer to be studied he wrote for the world at large and he wrote to the end that he might be read and read continually his matter his manner the terms of his philosophy the quality of his ideals the nature of his achievement proclaim him popular like scott like cervantes like shakspeare he claims not merely our acquaintance but an intimate and abiding familiarity he has no special public and to be only on nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his attraction and unworthy of his society he worked not for the boys and girls of an age but for men and women of all time  and both as an artist and as a thinker he commands unending attention and lifelong friendship he is a great inventor an unrivalled craftsman a perfect master of his material his work is the record of a lifetime of varied experience of keen observation of unwearying intellectual endeavour the types he created are vigorous and sound with an intellectual flavour peculiarly their own his novels teem with ripe wisdom and generous conclusions and improving examples he has as mr stephen remarks the undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary society with a force and accuracy not oven rivalled by any other writer not to have studied him is to be without a knowledge of the most important documents of contemporary history it is evident that such a writer is not one to be skimmed and laid aside and that it is doing his admirers doubtful service to present him in any but the handiest of forms now this is exactly what has come to pass in the present edition it is sumptuous but it is unwieldy it is inaccessible without a readingdesk and a library chair to peruse it is to engage in the performance of a literary solemnity we consider it with a respectful admiration and we think with a mixture of envy and regret of the editions of alphonso lemerre and the delightful bouquim produced by jouaust at the librairie des bibliophiles what was wanted was a fielding that could be comfortably held and easily perused and that while an ornament to the shelf would not on occasion have proved impossible to the pocketa fielding with whom the reader might converse at odd hours of the day or night with the affectionate freedom that is his due what has been achieved is a fielding to be superbly bound and gilded honoured with a prominent place in the library and venerated for his appearance a fielding to be revered at a respectful distance like a colossal pharaoh or mr addisons celebrated tragedy of  cato another point on which we regret to find ourselves at variance with the publishers of the new fielding is the illustrations it is at all times difficult to understand why the library edition of a great writer should be held incomplete without pictures and the difficulty is increased tenfold when the great writer enjoys such a position as is henry fieldings in the first place it is not doubtful that if fielding wrote for any class of readers in particular it was for readers who were interested in his work not as a vehicle for illustrations but primarily and essentially as literature and that could we suppose him to have been consulted in the matter he would be mortified to find that after over a hundred years of popularity his novels are held to stand in need of adventitious assistance again tom jones and  jonathan wild and amelia have been classics for many years we know them intimately and we have formed as definite a conception of the appearance of their heroes and heroines as we have of the men and women of shakespeare and cervantes themselves and it is certain that the artist who essays to improve upon our imaginings for us or to thrust them out to make room for imaginings of his own is doomed in advance to failure moreover and this is perhaps the strongest argument of allthere is a gap between the present and that part of the past which it was fieldings lot to represent for us between the convention of today and the convention of a century and a half ago between the age of gladstone and the age of walpole that is for all practical purposes as impassable as styx itself the present is an epoch of sentiment its ideals and ambitions are mainly emotional what it chiefly loves is romance or the affectation of romance passion selfconscious solemnity and a ertain striving after the picturesque in fieldings time there was doubtless a food deal of sentimentality for his geneation delighted not only in western md trunnion and mrs slipslop but in pamela and clarissa and the pathetic lie fevre but for all that it wasat all wents in so far as it was interesting to fielding and in so far as fielding has pictured ita generation that knew nothing f romance and was keenly interested in lommon sense and took a vast deal of honest pleasure in wit and humour and a rather ruculent type of satire it is evident that such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between a past of this sort and such a present as our own must f necessity bo few and small their importance too is greatly diminished when we reflect on the nature and tendency 3f certain among though essential elements of fieldings art and mind the most vigorous and the most individual of these is perhaps his irony the next is that abundant vein of pure intellectual comedy by the presence of which his work is exalted to a place not much inferior to that of such work as the  tartuffe  and the  ecole des femmes these rare and splendid qualities are distinguishing features in the best and soundest part of fieldings work of irony he is probably the greatest english master of pure comedy the intellectual manipulation and transmutation of what is spiritually ridiculous in manners and societyhe is both in narrative and in dialogue the greatest between shakespeare and mr george meredith and with both our sympathy is to say the least of it imperfect in no small degree ave have learned to be sentimental and selfsufficient with rousseau to be romantic and chivalrous with scott to be emotional with dickens to take ourselves seriously with balzac and george eliot there are touches of feeling in our laughter even though the feeling be but spite we have acquired a habit of politenessa tradition of universal consideration and respect and our theory of satire is rounded by the harmless generalities of mr du maurier on the one hand and the malevolent respectability of mr w s gilbert on the other a consequence of all this is that in attempting the illustration of  tom jones and  jonathan wild the modern artist enters on a task for which he is indifferently prepared and in which he can at best achieve but an imperfect success this is what has happened to mr small he is probably as good a draughtsman for wood as the publishers could have selected in picturing the aspects and emotions of his contemporaries he is usually successful he has the true sentiment of black and white his invention is varied his design expressive and sound yet of the forty pictures he has contributed to the new fielding there is hardly one that does not seem inappropriate to his matter and that does not act as a barrier between his author and his authors readers it is not that the illustrations are bad in themselves on the contrary many of them are excellent but they have little or none of fieldings spirit and they are in no sense in harmony with fieldings work in thackeray or in messrs besant and rice in  denis duval or  the chaplain of the fleet they would be well enough in  amelia and  joseph andrews  they appear misplaced and their affect is discomforting they have faults f their own as for instance a certain inlecision in invention which has resulted in the production of two or three westerns half a dozen joneses several jonathan wilds and a strange variety of amelias ind sophias but their chief fault is that they do not illustrate fielding mr small has left his comedy to shift for itself and has endowed him with picturesque and romantic qualities altogether foreign to his art and to the epoch in which it was produced he ignores lady bellaston and miss matthews and mrs ellison  he only shows us col bath as a defeated duellist and sergeant atkinson in though act of saving his masters life to him capt blifil is but a body to be carried upstairs and jones a slim young gentleman to be presented under the influence of violent emotion  he has made nothing of partridge nothing of the ordinary and next to nothing of mr abraham adams and for one picture of lady booby conceived in something of the right spirit he has given us half a dozen of sophia which are merely pretty and clever and accomplished and just as he has suppressed the element of comedy so has he exaggerated the element of incident his picture of joseph andrews stripped and abandoned has the gloom and the terror of a design for  eugeno aram he has drawn us three or four duels as many bouts at fisticuffs and a couple of highway robberies his sketch of jonathan wild picking the counts pocket might illustrate a melodrama in a strand theatre his presentment of booth in prison is like a page from a modern novel in the manner of  oliver twist his designs in one word are suggestive now of a fielding who wrote for the adelphi and now of a fielding who lived at bedford park the impression as may be imagined is peculiar to this may be added that though fairly well engraved they are on the whole ill printed for the reproduction of such trenchant contrasts as those in which mr small indulges such a medium as india paper seems improper it is soft and spongy and it absorbs and spreads the ink so that an impression is often produced of vagueness and indecision it is probable that a better effect might be obtained with ordinary platepaper which is hard and glossy and permits of a great deal of clearness of outline and transparency of darks and shadows for the selection of wood engraving in preference to etching as a means of illustration the projectors of the edition deserve a great deal of praise and we cannot but regret that their venture should be unfortunateas in certain ways it undoubtedly is in addition to all this it must be admitted that the editing of the new fielding is by no means so scholarly as was to be desired the arrangement is entirely arbitrary  the text save that in  amelia a few suppressed passages have been reprinted appears to be mainly that of arthur murphy of annotations and explanations which are absolutely indispensable to a correct and complete understanding of fielding and which judiciously supplied would have gone far to make the edition final there is not one in all the ten volumes that these are defects and grave ones will readily be granted they are blemishes too that were hardly to be looked for in such an elaborate publication as the present to the absence of critical and historical annotations we have just referred  and we shall add no more than that in our opinion it does away with any pretensions to finality the edition might have been supposed to possess scarce less noticeable are the vices of arrangement tom jones 1749 the authors second novel is printed first it is followed immediately by amelia 1751 which was his last and this in its turn is succeeded by joseph andrews 1742 which was his first in though same volume with joseph andrews appears though  journey from this world to the next which first appeared in the second volume of the  miscellanies published in 1743 while the fifth volume is composed of  jonathan wild originally printed as the third volume of the  miscellanies and of fieldings contributions to the champion which appeared in 17391740 two or three years before the sixth volumo contains in the order specified thirtyseven articles from the covent garden journal 1752 against the twentysix reprinted by murphy  the ten numbers of the true patriot 1745 included in murphys edition  the two numbers of the jacobites journal 1748 republished by murphy the philosophical transactions 1743 the essay of the remedy of afflictions the  dialogue between alexander the great and diogenes the cynic the interlude and the essays on  conversation character and nothing 1743 and the  clear state of the case of elizabeth canning and the  case of bosavern penlez which appeared full ten years later the seventh volume opens with the  voyage to lisbon which is a posthumous publication  passes on to the  charge to the middlesex grand jury  and the  inquiry into the causes of the late increase of robbery which date from 1751 and 1753 respectively and after presenting us with the early prefaces to  david simple and the  familiar letters continues with the  translation of the second olynthiac and the  poems included in the  miscellanies in 1743 and concludes with the translation of juvenals sixth satire which is one of fieldings first performances the last three volumes are devoted to the plays and include  very properly  the two pieces first printed among the  miscellanies it is to be noted that the dates of production are not always given and that the editor has very wisely prefaced each play with a statement of the cast where much is wanting one is apt in the nature of things to feel grateful for little of mr stephens introductory essay we can speak in terms of almost unqualified approval it is not so hearty and cheerful as the excellent note on fielding contributed to one of the series of hours in a library it repeats unquestioningly the old old story of the fielding portrait it comments upon lady marys estimate of fielding and horace walpoles malevolent historiette as though the ladys literary weaknesses and walpoles fondness for decorating his gossip had no existence and were not to be taken into the writers calculation and it errs a little in electing to consider its hero according o the canons of modern morality in showing i trifle more interest

B9103,"['8954323', '2438135']",  the secret of an empress by countess zanardi landi cassell  co 16s net the last of the children of the emperor and empress of austria who figure in the  almanach de gotha  was born in 1868  but the writer of the book before us claims to be the daughter of the empress elizabeth and states that she was born in 1882 she informs the public that her birth took place at a chateau in normandy where her mother was staying under an assumed name but she does not know her birthday a few weeks later she was smuggled into the house of some people in vienna and it was announced to the viennese that the lady of this house had given birth to a daughter the author of this curious memoir it is stated in the first chapter that the emperor  came secretly to see the empress while she was at the chateau of sassetot in the seine inferieure but that  what passed between her and the emperor now will never be revealed it is suggested that the reason why the empress wished her child brought up without knowledge of her parentage was that the empress did not want this last of her children to be educated at the court and preferred her childhood to be as different as possible from that of her other children the book is full of mysterious references to ludwig ii of bavaria and to the affection of the empress for his memory which cannot fail to make the reader ask what it is that the author means she is however studiously vague and declines to take the public into her confidence on the most important of all points though she indulges in hundreds of pages of trivial details about her childhood on one occasion after the empress had told her that she was her real mother she ventured to ask  why were you so fond of ludwig of bavaria mother   she notes that the empress  started violently at my words and i felt that i should have liked to bite off my foolish tongue but the empress recovered her selfpossession and remarked that the question had been unexpected that  she would like to talk to me about him she knew i must be bewildered and it was time that i should be enlightened a little the enlightenment was  little as all that it comes to as reported by the author is that in the opinion of the empress ludwig ii was not mad but the empress brought the conversation to a close with the significant words   we two remain to mourn for him in the account given of the death of this bavarian king wide variations will be noticed from all the official statements the authors account derived she says from the empress elizabeth is a convenient one  but to the public it may be incredible that the empress was an odd woman that she spent a large part of her life in wandering about the world and in living quietly where she was unrecognized is already known to the public  but there is much in this volume which will interest those who care for gossip and will tell them for the first time why the empress hid herself and how she contrived to spend long holidays often in the same hotel with the child whom the austrian court refuses to recognise as being a member of the royal family the author lays stress on her account of the mayerling tragedy and what she calls the true solution of that mystery is that the crown prince rudolph was murdered and did not commit suicide she believes that a party hostile to him was formed at the court the crown prince took no interest in military affairs and he found the soldiers and the emperor were against him his unhappy marriage is described at length and the way in which he became acquainted with marie vetsera when she was staying with him at mayerling the emperor is said to have sent baron bolfrass to search the house and arrest the crown prince rudolph threatened to shoot the first man who entered the room in a struggle the crown prince shot a gamekeeper and was himself shot as was marie vetsera this is the story ofthe countess zanardi landi and it is given as coming direct from the empress elizabeth the author reports that shortly before the death of the empress her mother promised to introduce her to the world   should i know my father and ssers   i asked  yes of course she answered 41 wonder how i shall get on with them    very well i hope dear anyhow they will not trouble us much  the author asked the empress how she was going to  bring her out and the answer was   very simply th emperor will have to announce officially   tht th empress and he have a third daughtr living who has been educated away from th court and who will be introduced on the occasion of his jubilee it will not make any trouble whatever all is in order the papers and everything that is al that will be neeessarv after the assassination of the empress the author wished to get into touch with her relatives but the lady with whom she was boarding warned her in the folowing words to avoid trouble   your mother and the emperor never northeast reed is it any wonder then that they went separate ways and as far a possible sought consolation elsewhere     von must keep quiet for your mother sake if you dont want the story in everybodys mouth according to the tale here told the empress left her child a fortune of 160000 she married a man for whom she did not care the money was placed in his hands and he at once lost it by seculation in 1906 she went with him to canada but parted from him in 1908 and after a series of struggles was married again to count zanardi landi the countess describes the legal action which she began in vienna and says that she refused 1 million crowns

work  books biographical the secret of an empress by countess zanardi landi cassell i6s net we took up this volume not without misgiving but that flavour of courtly rottenness which generally hangs about this class of literature is not at all pronounced here on the contrary the book is a protest against everything of the kindthe author is animated with all the empress elizabeths hatred of restraint and conventionality its title to be sure is a popular one and may well have been chosen with a view to appealing to snobs of every class with a view to  selling it deserves to sell we hope it will bring all the material profit possible to those concerned for countess landi is unquestionably entitled to every kind of compensation she can extract out of this world she tells her tale with such straightforward simplicity that these pages we think will not fail to procure her a number of new friends vivid sidelights are thrown upon the manifold tragedies and absurdities of the house of hapsburg and the fantastic ritual there is no other word for it which orders the life of the austrian court that perverse institution overhung by the mephitic vapours of jesuitry where the empress may not even see her own children unless her visit is announced twentyfour hours beforehand where everybody up to the very head of the state moves about like puppets in some sinister pantomime there is a good little bit too about the empresss ideas of what constitutes a small villa mother had intended to have a small villa at corfu with beautiful gardens attacked to it the cost was not meant to exceed

of genius  is not only great enough to engage the investigators concen trated powers but  from the standpoint of literary origins more important than anv other phase of a career but no one can 1uestion the interest which must always be felt about the parentage childhood and education of a favourite author especially one who seenis to identify herself so thoroughly as eorge elliot with the dreams and sufferings of her characters 11er personality in fact will carry with it an explanation of that strange mingling of intellectual arrogance and aloofness with lassionate sympathy which characterises her art miss d ea kin in one of her few critical comments has quoted the  wise and tender words  of mr gilfil ol sees us as we are altogether not in starate telitig or actions as our

one of the things george eliot longed to sav that way that god has of seeing us is the wav the true artist has it is the way george eliot herself had this emphatic and picturesque statement however does not cover the whole matter and somewhat depreciates the value of the personal insight which miss dleakin has specially set herself to afford for much of george eliots power comes from that halfknowledge which we derive from our own experience as we all know she put much of herself into maggie tulliver she had faced in her own person many of the problems confronting romola and esther lvon wendolen dorothea and will ladislaw we mav learn from this  early life how faithfully her novels reflect her deepest convictions on men and life it proves also that like her own heroines she seldom depended on her own judgment however tenaciouslv if not dogmatically she would pronounce upon the convictions she had acquired at every stage of her intellectual or emotional development she confesses to an  absolute need of some one person who should be all in all to her and to whom she should he all in all probably without george  henry lewes she would never have written a novel each of the many religious phases through which miss deakin has traced her was dlue directly to the personal influences as mliss nmeynell expresses it in each case the apostolic man becomes the womans conscience such chances it will be remembered were at an end before the publication of her first novelin her thirtyninth year she had then settled town into a broad humanitarianism subscribing to no definite creed but convinced  of the efficacy thit lies in all sincere faith and the spiritual blight that comes with no faith miss mlevnell i n d e e d defines her ethical code as  uncom promisingly christian  and  very hard admitting no possibility of  compromise or dispensation the code of a woman who in her own conulict of life has broken all the pledges made and implied for her by her parentage kin and educlation on the personal aspect of this question miss deakin reveals more sy impathetic generositt greater subtlety andi in our opinion more justice she enleavours to show that eorge eliot never put greater value on the restrictioins of conventionality than when she broke them in her opinion only exceptional circunimtances like her own coiuld maake reeltlion permissible she never resented  the qluick condemination  of public opinion however much the mistinderstanding of friends hurt her privately she held herself justified and never regarded the teaching of her novels as an atonement they upheld what she had always believed  what in her own heart she felt she had practised miss deakin has justified her contention by reliable evidence perhaps the most valuable part of her work she also tells us how early in life george eliot was puzzled by finding that glory was an attendant on luck instead of on goodness 9 and that like maggie tulliver  at a very early age she got the idea into her head that she would become a person of importance in the world we find her accepting a  compromise  with her father on the trying question of religious observances and are assured that however autobiographical or reminiscent her books contained no actual portraits from real life there is too an interesting passage about the  tidiness  of her writing which recalls mrs poysers dairy a quality evincing selfdiscipline and conscientiousness not entirely congenial to the highest art yet surely it is as an artist that george eliot will live by her characterization her insight and her wit her genius for dialogue invention and narrative she has given us a glorious gallery of fulllength portraits increasing the number of our intimate friends and through them the problems of life which have an endless fascination for all who care to think in that sense her work remains as dr herford puts it  a great and still unexhausted literary and ethical force miss deakin could not give us too much detail in illustration of her personality and her powers though only the serious student will wish to follow so closely her various incursions into philosophy it is not as a thinker that we value george eliot today the quotations and deductions from her letters and journals are most welcome we could willingly have been spared some of her essays and reviews r brimley

young man john looked very confidential and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies practice walking the more graceful they become in their movements those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one a graceful correctionthe proper study of mankind is womanpunch woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive a kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  a miss way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a kentucky lawyer in that city after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from congo squareexchange does she propose to take the kentucky lawyer up with her or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon brigham young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of utah are her women it is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources the last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers  the poet of the breakfast table saturday november 2 1872 literature by oliver wendell holmes routledge  sons we have had the autocrat and the professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour we cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded it would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the poet like the autocrat and professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly the breakfasttable series is now complete its fault is its extreme length the poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse if he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as pas trop de zele the poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue there are fourteen persons at the breakfast table the opposite ends are occupied by the landlady and the capitalist on one side are the poet the scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a man of letters a master of arts a young girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called scheherazade and the lady on the other side are dr b franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the astronomer the member of the haouse as the legislator calls himself the registrarof deeds the salesman and that boy the lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community he turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary in this company the poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures they are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries the poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match the following are among very numerous examples  it aint just the thing to grease your ex with the isle of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do again   it is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle cotton mather was miserable all his days i am afraid after that entry in his diary  this day dr sewele was chosen president for his piety1 we may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal americans believe that there are no hs in england and frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  however we could match the goodlooking landlady of the poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope the daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the order of things and who remarks  i hope to do some sound thinking in heavenif i ever get there  fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects the first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted they have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from heaven the groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem we approve of the old masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed i dont like your chopped music any way that woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesflorence nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowiez out isnt not that exactly but something like it i have been to hear some music pounding after describing the concert with much humour he adds i like to hear a woman sing and i like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me i know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and pop went a small piece of artillery    that boy was in his seat looking demure enough the master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which i saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our great organthat himalayan home of harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often there is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  i thank god that a great many people believe a great deal more than i do i think when it comes to serious matters i like those who believe more than i do better than those who believe less there is no doubt that this is a general feeling we endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   it is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it if he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone in quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the breakfast table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids the character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the young girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the weekly bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it the poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul she ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail i spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night the poet thinks the toiling scheherazade of the weekly bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers the sunworshippers daughter which she wrote for the bucket here is a sample  kiss mine eyelids beauteous morn blushing into life newborn  lend me violets for my hair and thy russet robe to wear and thy ring of rosiest hue set in drops of diamond dew  kiss my lips thou lord of light kips my lips a soft good night westward sinks thy golden car  leave me but the evening star and my solace that shall be borrowing all its light from thee  we may now rise from the breakfast table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that wellfurnished board,biography
B1165,['4692800'],  n boyne water a talc by te o1ha famity a  3 vols 12moanotber tale of the waely school mth  ft werly school with jreland for the 5cc and irelands history for the subject sated as we have been with scottish story we are quite ready to turn to the records of another country and ireland as well as or better than any other she furnishes materials in abundance she has been oppressed for ages and her oppressors have been her historians she is catholic and we have her story told by protestants misrepresentations inevitably followed and prejudices have now rooted in the hearts of successive generations it is high time to hear the other side freely and fully and no way half so effective as the medium of tales for nothing else nowadays gets regarded the writer of the tale before us is well qualified to play the part of national historian under the guise of the national novelist isle knows the country and its history and is deeply stung with a sense of that country injuries he wants nothing but a little more resolution to cut away superfluities and a little more address in conduicting us at once medias in res he is too fond of surprises he attempts by crowding incidents to give that life and reality which would be better accomplished by lopping off the encumbrances of minor ones and the flow of his language is too frequently checked by breaks and parentheses but these are curable defects he has the stuff and staple of a good narrator in him when he comes to the action and warms in the business of his tale he is vivid and vigorous scenes of bustle and confusion rouse his best energies and his powers of description mental moral and natural are of no ordinary cast historical novelists at least those of any value have an object distinct from the tale that of the author of the scotch novels is sufficiently obvious and the views of the writer of the boyne water are equally conspicuous he regards the struggle of the revolution as one of religious parties he gives james credit for moderation and believes he had no other view in any of his attempts than to rescue catholics from their oppressions and to establish general toleration of course the revolution itself was gratuitous on the other hand he considers william to have been influenced by the same views but overborne by the fears and bigotries of the protestant clergy of the latter there can be little question but quite as little we think that james whatever were his private wishes never would have been sutf fered to stop at all short of the reestablishment of catholic superiority the main object of the novel is to give a representation of the state of ireland from jamess abdication as his expulsion is still curiously phrased to the treaty of limerick though the tale commences with his accession just to give the author an opportunity of exhibiting the feelings of expectation which that event excited among all partie to the principat characters of i the tale we are introduced on their way from belfast to cushindoll a village on the northeast coast the travellers consist of evelyn and his sister both very young ver handsome and very amiable in the style of those who are destined to figure in  modern story with their guardians and attendants of whom in our brief sketch we shall have no occasion to speak in crossing the hills the topography of which is very elaborately described extraordinary difficulties are encounteredroads were not macadamized in those daysand to fill up the measure of their alarms and embarrassments a tremendous storma tornado such an one as is now never seen without the tropics overtakes them a sweeping dispersion ensues one falls to the earth another performs a series of somersets down the hills and miss evelyn is luckily rescued from destructionher frightened jennet backing to the very edge of a precipice7by the critical appearance and fearless energies of a young gentleman and lady these young natives of the hills a brother and sister prove to be persons of most surprising excellence vigorous and resolute as the mountaineers of romance are of course entitled to be to the house of their parent a ruined chieftain of the clan mcdonnel the young evelyn and the party are finally carried for shelter intimacy soon grows up among the young people and they are speedily betrothed to each other out of these sudden engagements spring the subsequent interests and perplexities of the talethe mcdonnels being catho lies and the evelyns protestants evelyn just to give him time to reach his majority is dispatched to the westindies for a couple of years and returns to ireland to consummate his marriage with eva mcdonnel at the period when every body was in a state of excitement respecting the invasion of william mcdonnel meets his friend on landing at carrickfergus aid in a few hours each of them unknown to the other is enlisted on opposite sides evelyn is encountered by george walker the well known defender of derry and by the urgency of that wily agitator is engaged to take part in the approaching struggle and at the same moment the jesuit ohaggerty presents mcdonnel with a commission of dragoons in the service of james walker labours hard to break off the match with the catholic eva and at last exacts a promise to be summoned to the nuptials on the day of the double marriage the ceremony delayed by the nonarival of walker at length proceeds and eva and evelyn are coupled by the catholic priest but just as the second ceremony is commencing strange noises are heard and a furious gust of wind extinguishes most of the lights and in rushes walker declaring the marriage illegal and announcing the landing in england of william the deliverer confusion follows the ceremony suspends walker calls upon evelyn and ohaggerty upon mcdonnel to fulfil their respective engagements and sacrifice their private wishes to public duties each is surprised by the discovery of the others engagement sitspicion spring up in the breast of each their passions kindle high words follow and brides and bridegrooms separate impelled by walker evelyn joins the ulster union and accepts a commission in williams name but before joining the troops he conducts his distressed sister to her friends at derry and proceeds himself to look after his family estate on the lough neagh on advancing up the avenue he perceives unusual stirrings in the house and while hastening forward to ascertain the cause lie strikes against the legs of his own servant dangling from a tree alarmed and retiring his retreat is instantly cut off on all sides by armed men who force him to go forward to the house which he now discovers to be in the full possession of a party of rapparees he receives a very hearty welcome from them to his own home and is hospitably entertained by them with a supper provided from his own stores and by his own cook the feast is suddenly interrupted by the intelligence of an enemy at hand up starts the party measures are instantly taken for defense and the commander places a guard over evelyn with orders to shoot him on the spot should the invaders prevail these invaders prove to be evelyns friends headed by walker the rapparees were defeated and evelyn was rescued from his fate by the artifice of a young lass who had taken a fancy to him and threw some water on the lock of the guards pistol which was thus snapped at him in vain evelyn now joined the forces under lord mount alexander and was wounded in the first battle fought at dromore on the retreat from newry and left bleeding on the field on recovering his senses he seizes a stray horse and sets out for the north beyond carrickfergus the redshanks lord antrims dragoons a troop of which mcdonnel commanded were scouring the country and lhe quickly found himself pursued his horse failing he betook himself to his legs and after flying across we know not how many hills and dales and endeavouring to descend a steep declivity he sunk at last exhausted in a hole of the rock till his pursuers came up with him at the first of whom he dis charged a pistol it was mcdonnel himself no harm was done they recognise each other and a reconciliation follows he refuses to take evelyn prisoner in spite of the sulky remonstrances of his men but dismissing them to the next town himsclf to the neglect apparently of his military duties engages to eonthllet h    i  l4l1jz friend to a place of safety this hoevesr is not so easily aecomllised prodigious diffieultwis are encountered a most painful and laborious

of his friend eva now gees to her friends and evelyn with mcdound on parole proceeds to derry to visit his sin ter and mcdonnel and miss evelyn swh of course come again to a perfect under standing the memorable siege had already orn menced and evelyn takes an active pm in the defence under walker whose cleo racter is here ably developed a singular union of energy craft and fanaticism the whole progress of the siege to the final relief by the arrival of kirke is faith fiully and vigorously detailed and presents many a striking picture of the miseries sus tained by that devoted city fromn the can nonadingy without and the famine within with the unresisting submission of the citi zens and walker and his few energetic apprenticeboys in the course of the siege an attempt is again made to celebrate the marriage between mcdonnel and evelyns sister which is again interrupted by the mysterious agency of a wild irishwomn possessed of something like the attributes of omniscience and ubiquity and the poor girl at last dies from the combined effects of fright famine and fever on the raising of the siege the mcdlon nels and evelyn being again all together and passes and protections obtained they proceed towards old mcdonnels butby this time schomberg had landed 2o000 men and kirke had set out to join him to wards the south old mcdonnels unluckily lay in his way and there was

character threw him into a storm of bh ror and he makes desperate efforts to pmr slue him in spite of his weakness and the i rls efforts to detain shim they had not roceeded far before they were challenged by the troops of his own volunteercorps from the commander of whom evelyn forthwith solicits a horse and attendants to enable him to overtake kirke when to his confusion and despair he learns that kirke had left orders to put him under arrest resistance is vain but three or four days bringt up the corps to schombergs camp schomberg with kirke by his side was reviewing the troops evelyn advances in front of the line and in the presence of schomberg demands of kirke the cause of his arrest who charges him with aiding and abetting rcbels he appeals to the old duke and exhibits his passes and protections and is immediately released then finding schomberg disposed to befriend him he demands of kirke an account of eva kirke haughtily refuses evelyn challenges and schlomberg sanctions the challenge and witnesses the conflict on the spot by an accidental slip evelyn is finally worsted and having put his cause upon his failing sword is thus left without redress eva appears lost to him for ever schomberg appoints him his aiddecamp retains him about him for the remainder of the campaign and at the end of it sends him with despatcles to england in london or rather at kensington where wiliam resided he is detained for the winter the interior of the court is thrown open and we have william and mary and ben tinck and burnett very characteristically exhibited two or three times in the gar dens he gets a glimpse of a person in a male dress whom he believes to be eva but in spite of his efforts he is unable to speak with her in the spring he returns to schomberg and at last gets a short leave of absence to attend to his private affairs his first step is to go straight to sarsfields camp then at dublin sarsfield had saved the life of evelyn and his friend before derry wlhen they had indiscreetly accompanied the deputation of the city to jamess camp and on this ground of acquaintanceship evelyn ventures to introduce hiwrself to that brave man to procure intelligence of eva he gets detained by the outposts and meets again with the girl who had twice saved his life and also with the figure whom he had taken for eva but again is baffled in his attempts to speak with her sarsfield receives him with kindness and testifies an interest in his distress though knowing nothing whatever of the fate of mcdonnel or eva he recollects there is a lady of the name at jamess court and he engages to take him in the evening to the castle there he is noticed as a stranger by james who enters into conversation with him defending his conduct and vindicating his rights blat what is most interesting to evelyn he recognises among the attendants of lady lyreonnel the lady lieutenant bis own eva but again every attempt to addres her is defeated hisinterview with james is thus suddenly interrupted by the junex pected announcement of willias landim and having actually been six days in the country the party breaks up sersfield dismisses evelyn with a pass and hi

aocompanies sarsfield on the memorable ex pedition in which with the aid of the rap parees he succeeded in destroying williams ammunition and baggage the commander of these rapparees turns out to be his long lost friend mc donnel whose kindness to him had brought suspicion upon himself and finally dismissal from the service resentment and despair drove him to head a band of these desperadoes he ipeets with evelyn and while pouring curses upon him and preparing to cut him down a signal from his friends arrests his pu pose here too again evelyn meets with the person whom he had so often taken for eva and discovers him at last to be a younger brother of hers some words of explanation pass but he is as violent as his elder brother all is mystery to evelyn he cannot guess the cause of this

B4825,"['6786209', '8986863']",  young lives by richard le gallienne arrowsmith fis 7ms is mr le galliennes third novel and taken with these that preceded itthe quest of the golden girl and the romance of zion chapelit shows us clearly what ara his powers and limitations in fiction it shows us that tos the qelineation of a certain type of young man a product of the best two decades mr le gallienne has considerable gifts he young man is of the nonconformist middle dasses his home ls strict arid pious his own bent however is for poetry and gladness he is frank impulsive enthusiastic generous warmhearted intolerant of alltiiat is dull and mechanical and very tolerant of whatever is  done beautifully however it may conflict with the moral code he is an agnostic with leanings towards elaborate ritual a busy but superficial reader his gods being keats and pater a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of rossetti ana burnejones a sentimentalist he oan adore many young women at once and in rhyming  love  and  dova  and  bosom  and  blossom  he is expert if he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable but far less  lovable  and to be  lovable is his end in life that is the type of young man to whioh we refer a type whioh at this moment is common in london and in all the great towns all over the oountry and it is this young man whom mr le gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill and as we said last week in noticing another new novel every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction mr le gallienne is not a good novelist he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful he ia always the essayist astorytolling glad of an opportunity to digress but though he has little to toll in the book before us and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed the tone is bright and sunny and the characters are pretty and gay but the readers will have to be simple we fear because with the exception of the type who rings true there is a great deal of chocolatebox unreality about the story baptist ministers for example onwhose shelves is all the most exquisite literature of doubt are not really named chrysostom trotter it is largely these wilful little perversions of fact which mr le gallienne always indulges in that keep sophisticated readers from his works but for their especial benefit we take it the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher mr le gallienne here hits round him with spirit sparing not even himself we quote a passage presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hairlike a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood at the same moment there entered as if by design his very eatithesis a short firmlybuilt clerkly fellow with a head hkea billiardball in need of a shave a big brown  moustitohs aad enormous spectacles   that said

have to wait for it he would hasten it if he would cut his hair but tbat he says he will never do his hair is his battlecry aad hair too he says is a gift well he enjoys himself and loves a fight though you mightnt think it to look at him in laying young lives aside we cannot honestly say it has interested us but it is innocent and bright and young and it is written with care  young lives bv richard le gallienne bristol arrowsmith a duet with an occasional chorus by a conan doyle grant richards here is another volume of secondrate sentiment from mr richard le gallienne we cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or notat any rate it reads as if it were meant to be it describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a northern town whose home surroundings as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes were uncongenial the young manto the benefit probably of the home to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his fatherdetermined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature he gets some poems published he falls in love and he keeps up his affection for his sister but it all reads false somehow the young man is most devoted to his sister which is very right and proper and charming no doubt but he is not content with that and must needs analyse his feelings and her feelings and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of it is the same with his sweetheart angel they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments they see a rossetti picture which they admire and they call it their church and their altar they are probably not conscious hypocrites but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites who having a fine feeling think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world the sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity this book is full of that kind of sentimentality and it is bad mr conan doyles tale on the other hand certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality it is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people who make love and get married their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet but they are fine in character and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward the book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middleclass respectability which is unassuming and not discontented of the two sets of characters mr doyles characters would certainly have less to talk about than henry and angel but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting for they are genuine and they are described simply and without affectation if mr le gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable but without a suspicion of satire they are duller than the limited yet excellent crosses,biography

B4898,"['8859500', '8980030']",  the life and works of charlotte bronte and i her sitters with introductions to the  works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co fint notice the true criticism of the work of the sisters bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple it ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above haworth parsonage or we might add the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours wanderings in those almost classic haunts the journeyings would reveal of course many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect but imagination after we had come south or gone north would but see a great picture synthetic and simple and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and  spirit of the heathlands the deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe so the general features in thoroughgoing bronte criticism will be sheer simple outstanding the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion for charlotte and emily bronte were strange and intense souls and in their books it is the soul  fact that matters true there are a hundred less inspired things let them be quietly touched and passed the great poetic passionate creative stages are elemental and bold easily seen by those that can see and having duly marked them and told their quality criticism has done its broad work it cannot sound their mystery wring out the secret of their inspiration any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature mrs humphry ward is sometimes thoughtful in her bronte studies but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details we could wish on the other hand that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters work in literature or the evolution of literature is satisfactorily determined in her introduction to jane eyre she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised today by charlotte brontes novels on the imagination of england but this suggests the important and here unconsidered question whether the reading world on the whole realises what great fiction ought to be whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of miss bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute it is to be feared as a matter of fact that england and the continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction and despite mrs wards high opinion of latterday developments of the novel it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature a worthy instrument it has been in some instances a noble one we have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action giving embodiment to as we might say spiritual romance indicating in characters and destinies something of the soul above souls vision of the power that  ever accompanies the march of man the general desire however is that he should walk  rationally  upon earth and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another much too muchis expected of him as a delineator of daily manners till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals the autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance it might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two artsthat of revealing spiritual forces permanent passions like a great poet or dramatist and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities the two powersthe interaction of the two worldsmake the true novel to be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential  a keen problem  necessitates vision intuition opportunity aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction the vision and the intuition are of the greater importance on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis or the work as it were of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a 4 time spirit which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal if the vision of the sisters bronte sometimes failed them it was uncommon at its best and even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life mrs ward like many critics seems to entertain a too narrow idea the sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious knowing the celtic inheritance of the sisters of which more anon their contact with a world of great northern tradition the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad which stirred unimagined forces in their natures and made them critics of life in a higher sense than perhaps is commonly realizedunderstanding all this and more and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case it is the soul that matters not the number of miles travelled the number of cities seen in the actual world charlotte bronte has told as she was eminently fitted to tell the ordeals of souls that live alone in more senses than onethe never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers they are types old and new as the passion for sympathy the lack of consideration in any womans sphere and crises and partings journeys and reunions in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours they speak of souls rather than bodies faults and crudities of construction in jane eyre and its successorsmatters with which mrs ward deals at length  are sufficiently obvious had charlotte bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plotmaking and other prepossessions her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering perhaps almost to real fusion of material but some of her critics strictures on details are scarcely tenable we may not always regard mr rochester so gravely as his creatorhe does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of paul emmanuel but his early talk with jane eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which mrs ward imagines the judgement on the countryhouse party also is much too sweeping without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society one may gently urge that a governess of genius in her merciless way would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing possessing more or less glamour for the polite it is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgement on  high life  it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured but spiritually inferior convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn but the spirit of critical judgment especially after some of miss brontes own stories recorded by mrs gaskell will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side it were better no doubt to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues but haworth was not meet alas for her airy presence certainly charlotte bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical  shirley the novelist as we have suggested is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality but it is possible to slip on points of detail to fail now and then in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material and yet to be true again and again in the high hours to what the imagination recognises as aoulfact because charlotte bronte so vividly interpreted soulfact not occasionally but often we know that however fallible at other times she was an eminent novelist mrs ward maintains the interesting but of course by no means novel theory that the genius of charlotte bronte was fundamentally celtic the racial spirit or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow the momentum the environment of a race of changeful fortunes no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions and is an attractive if rather tentative study though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments but leaving temperaments and workaday selves and looking into the souls that live deeply the souls that create permanent literature we feel that they are of no race they know not geographical boundaries as to charlotte bronte and ireland she seemed unable to create aa irish character  the curate malone ia  shirley and the drunken mrs sweeny ia  villette are beneath notice in this regari but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work it is te be feared however that mrs ward has tee conventional an idea of celtic characteristics her remarks are a little too suggestive of matthew arnolds lectures on the 4 study ot celtic literaturelectures fruitful in their day and still useful but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated gaelic literature and irish or general celtic personality  celtic melancholy is but a halftruth joyousness is the dominant quality of much gaelic literaturejoyousness and n fierce zest of life the theory of though celts love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being  better than loneliness passed into a proverb with one order of celts for the theory of  celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern nor ds mrs ward convincing when she tries te explain bronte celticism as a growth of the ireland of the north on which commerce and protestantism have set their grasp this although perhaps a popular notion is but another halftruth the catholic and celtic traditions and elements of ulster are in their way outstanding in any case did not the rev patrick bronte come of a south of ireland family mrs wards consideration of the celtic basis of the bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real celticism and that the bronte sisters practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the vision that remakes the world were gaelic literature accessible as a whole it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races its modern successor angloirish literature does not really display a true grip of later irish realities and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities the celt has dreamed dreams idealised his moors and hills seen visions of hells and heavens that show a dantesque feeling without of course a dantesque art he has realised the tears of things and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life but he framed the elaborate brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empirebuilder far from being an elusive creature half within half without existence he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds mrs ward did be really know the various aspects of celticism might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious if halfinscrutable life in emily bronte rather than charlotte yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of english genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race there is truth on both sides how much of the spiritual the poetic the divine even lies below either racial consciousness seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment  this deeper human subconsciousness so to say carno 10 consciousness in the bronte sisters on their great moors in their yorkshire world of distinctive tradition in the crises of their struggling years it mixed with moods and found outlet in forms in which celt and touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves so when all is said the origins are of natures underlying store the result speaks for and to humanity  the life and works of charlotte bronte and her sisters with introductions to the works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co second notice mus ward inlier introduction to wuthering heights propounds a theory of an appreciable german influence a somewhat liberal infusion of hoffmann and even tieck in emily brontes work it muet be said at once that mrs ward unfortunately does not seem to realise the spirit and the stages of the  german romantic movement some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this german literature against which carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century  tieck and hoffmann says mrs ward  are full of raving and lunatic beings who sob shout tear out their hair by the roots and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours this to speak mildly is not fair criticism even of hoffmann but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of tieck the whole trend of mrs wards critique is unjust to the german  romantics  at their best to their beauty there is only a casual allusion there is no suggestion of those qualities both grave and humorous in which they are seen to differ decisivelyeven to the merely casual eye from the author of wuthering heights it would appear that mrs wards imagination has dwelled overmuch upon the earlier tieck and on the other hand it is more than doubtful that a mind like emily brontes could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of hoffmann or indeed of his english contemporaries of the school that would  make parnassus a churchyard in fact critics are too apt to exaggerate the  haunting effect of the bowl and dagger book men on the early century we may be sure there was an esoteric english self unimpressed by their terrors monk lewis it is suggestive to remember had no appreciable effect upon the house of commons and the haworth sisters let it never be forgotten had a critical as well as a creative faculty mrs wards theory however will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius as distinguished from casual shades and external dyessome of which in emily brontes case were no doubt germanic as some in charlottes were french anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature we know from charlotte brontes words and without them should realise the truth that emily bronte the creator the emily bronte who means much to the imagination owed little if anything to literature it lit or shadowed her mind of course as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome so to say of the british museum readingroom seem ages asunder in point of date and method all that places her apart owes no more to booklore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous brooding minds in the lonely icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas work to which remoteness from common actuality and profound aloof winters gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood by the way there was of course a norse element in yorkshire tradition and one finds it interesting to trace in emily bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far a critic in the athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in emily brontes genius to something far greater than that of german romancowhich of course at its best had some sense of greatness or at least was deeper than a cult more than a mere fashion in fiction  to no less than the genius of dante himself this is a highly interesting question which unfortunatelyat least so far as the present writer knowsthe acute critic has not considered in detail in this connexion and in view of emily brontes celtic ancestry it were profitable to study that celtic visionary spirit which made many infernos before and during dantes day even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency there was a potential dante in the racial soul and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the celts as to other aspects of the kinship it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain dantesque significance in the chief lovers in wuthering heights abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom catherine in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is heathcliff is no faint reminder of francesca but a dante would not allow a heathcliff or a catherine in hate or love to protest so much the tears and cries doubtless set mrs ward thinking of the minor features of german romance the passion as the forementioned critic recognized runs too much to rhetoric but the concentration not only of speech but of passion which mightnay would surely have come is indicated in a few of emily brontes best poems unfortunately enough in treating of her virtues or defect mrs wardwho holds the theory that  we passionately accept her or we are untouched by herdoes not always employ felicitous figures of speech charlotte bronte touches the shield of the readershe attacks him and complete as his ultimate surrender may be he yields fightingit is still more so with emily this martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelmingand artificial and  wuthering heights whatever its naivete of construction its signs of inexperience does not suggest the artificial it is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition it makes us as it were spectators in strange lands where our word counts for nothing we stand by pits of the passions had it been germanmade to the degree mrs ward imagines instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius it would not have its on the whole decisive imaginative justification were it possible for emily bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposesin short were she an artist of the receptive ordershe would surely have reproduced more of her overyday life in the manner of anne the frail little one in  agnes grey and more gloomily in  the tenant of wildfell hall or in that of even charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active emily was too original for that she obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which as charlotte said in a well known preface strangely wills and works for itself mr swinburne rightly finds in her  a dark unconscious instinct as of primitive nature  worship  unconscious instinct  contains more essential truth than the germanic dissertation of mrs ward and strangely enough if we may touch again the question of emily brontes ancestry in the oldest known fragment of celtic poetry handed down for hundreds of years in irish tradition there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of but absolute identification with nature there is a gleam as well as darkness and though suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering emily would have understood and sympathised with readily the singer is  the wind which breathes upon the sea the vulture upon the rocks  the ox of the seven combats  the fairest of plants a wild boar in valour a salmon in the water  a lake in the plaineverything in his sheer primaeval world as emily brontes spirit was everything in the great moorlands the singer before the dawn of celtic history expressed the dark unconscious instinct in the novelist and poet after sophisticated ages nature again stirred and spokethe nature below books and beyond race eventually of course as we see by the later poems the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy this haworth edition contains besides the novels and poems of the sisters and the  cottage poems of their father their portraits and the original titlepages and prefaces in their due places mrs gaskells life with an introduction and notes by mr clement shorter will conclude the series the style of the six volumes already issued is worthy of the house so honourably associated with haworth though occasionally the printer has neglected quota tion marks we have left to the last a reference to a feature which some will regard as specialillustrations from photographs of places indicated in the works they are of course interesting in their way though the way is too literal they would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones for instance though description of lucy snowe in london is accompanied by a picture of ludgate hill and st pauls cathedral in 1848 the pages have as much to do with ludgate hill of 1828 or 2048 they are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation,biography

B1206,"['4991985', '4618505', '4337431']",  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchen make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word  you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us  im not going to said 1 somewhat testily  ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  the tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor the religiomin seltiments wvhich the authoress puts into fjit itiouth of her heroines are either false ayjdl lld r so vagute autd unnvanuing as to add to thfe miircality oft hle seclles msithout in any

B2456,['8526331'],  the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,biography
B3520,['3170956'],  jude the obscur e after you have read  jude the obscure your thoughts run in two separate channels cut by mr hardys two nearly separate purposes your opinion of the book will largely depend on which you regard as the main one these purposes are wound in with the history of jude and the history of sue their histories are intertwined but they are not quite inevitable to each other and so to a greater extent than in most tragedies you can regard the two chief actors separately a work of the intensest human interest it is not evenly strong it has been written too much under the stress of feeling for that any discontent which is not roused by merely superficial causes which is not finnicking and any offence which the book may contain for timid readers must arise i think from the story of sue personally i feel no offence and i speak for at least some women but i am not  jude the obscure by thomam hardy 6s osgood aud mcilvaine sure if her championship might not have been bettered in herself she is one of mr hardys stimulating women he is particularly anxious not to shirk the consequences of her temperament of that free spirit of hers that gave so willingly when not coerced by laws and authority but in exhibiting the results of this temperament acting on her circumstancesher shillyshallying her contrariness about the marriage tiethere is an amount of exaggeration or of reiteration that becomes nearly absurd as did the fickleness in the hero of  the pursuit of the wvellbeloved there is here something more than the eeries of seemings or personal impressions spoken of in the preface there is downright propagandawhich is always unconvincing and even loosening to the convictions of the already converted sue is a woman that excites and leads she is influential her opinions and feelings do not need much emphasis and repetition wihen they are given these she becomes too much of a pamphlet and platform victim of the cruel marriage bond sue could love and was not well fitted for marriage life there she is not so very abnormal and this would be the sooner admitted had mr hardy not taken so much trouble to justify her running to and fro between phillotson and jude but i admit this is a cold reception to a warm protest and the fault of the novelist one may readily forgive to the man of feeling sending his chivalry bravely out in new directions there is perhaps some propaganda again in his attitude towards the dreary child time one may shudder over the boys dark way of cutting the knot of pecuniary misery but even the gruesome vision of the three little innocent dead bodies is not so terrible as the doctors suggestion of the boys state of mind being  the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live if one were to believe that the wish were to show itself first or generally in children there would be good reason for immediate and comprehensive human slaughter today is there amore terrible suggestion in all modern literature  yet it has nothing to do with a general misundtrsaiding of childhood there is one picture of sue as a child there are several of the boy jude that are quick ith sympathy but the book is not made up of theories and examples of theories the title is truly descriptive jude is the real subject and judes story is among the most notable of mr hardys work in bis greater booksand this is one urdoubtedlyhe has a way of passionately identifying himself with the aims or the sorrows of one personage whom he loves in his blackest his sinfullest his pitifullest moments that he does so and that he does not hide such moments make him one of the very grimmest and most sympathetic of all novelists tess the mayor clym yeobright and now jude are of the company judes history is written as life writes a history some features being traced from the beginning while later from hitherto unstirred depths circumstance calls up the others he is a man with the defects of his amiable virtues and his sensitive nature there is only one woman in the world for his love and reverence but if she be not there his loneliness may seek less good company in strong drink he has sometimes found a refuge from overtaxed nerves life finds out the weak places in his very human body and soul he is too and especially a man of the people with the native instincts of the scholar the poetry of his aspirations the disinterestedness of his pursuit the undyingness of his passion are made living to you and some of the selftaught mans vanity and his laboriousness of expression are not suppressed you think he must be cured for ever of his ambition that day when having received the  terribly sensible  repulse from the bead of bibliol college he stood at the crossway and began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating varied and compendious than the gown life and at that supreme moment when he the obscure craftsman wrote along the wall of the dull college from whence the repulse had come i have understanding as well as you but the passion is in his blood he wanders round and round the sacred places like a moth owned a candle christminster scenes mark the stages of his struggling aspiring life the imaginative child watching from the roof of the brown house the faroff spires and domes the nightwandering stonemason  under the walls and doorways feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings the ghosts of old scholars comrades of his solitude are striking pictures out of his early hopeful time in his sick and unfortunate days when forced to labour at an earlierlearnt trade than hii own he as arabella says still harps on christminster even in his cakes shaping these with grotesque pathos to a reminiscence of traceuied windows and cloisters there too he dies lonely and obscure to the hum of a college chapel organ and the shouts of commemoration games a poor workman to the end a boyish imprudence for which he never shirked the payment dogged him persistently and the woman who had been his light and leader left him in the darkness to fulfil for superstitions sake a loathed duty jude the lawabiding the conservative the kindly

of religion left him i should like to cry out that it was against her nature to do so but the reaction when life had frightened her is i fear not untrue to facts mr hardy does not wear rose  coloured glasses and he does not seek to hide that a man of the people like jude scholar and gentleman though he is has rough ways of going to the devil even if he doesnt stop long in that company but on the other hand his career may wholesomely astonish some middleclass readers inasmuch as it goes to prove that aspiring and sensitive souls do not need generations of literary education and genteel incomes to breed them and that poverty and the stress of life reveal to such sensitive souls a world that the comfortablyplaced and the unimaginative only deny because they have been saved and denied the chance of entrance sues story is a reality with some unhappy exaggeration about it but all that concerns jude in his strength and weakness is masterly and written out of a deep heart the constant

attended to having never as yet written without engaging the readers interest whether he agrees with or dissents from her philosophies her dialogue is naturalher eye for character is keen she enjoys humour obviouslyshe calls out pathos skilfully few things have been met in modern fiction more touching than the fading away of the poor girl to whom margaret hale attaches herself on removing from the south to a manufacturing town in lancashire the poetical methodism of thisgirl111011011101 uncomplaining affectionthe mixture of rudeness and of reverence with which she looks up to the delicatelynurtured lady make up an admirable picture the author of  mary barton  seems bent on doing for lancashire and the lancashire dialect what miss edgeworth did for ireland and scott for the land across the border there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,biography
B2585,"['8793448', '8688126']",  mmdlemarch  jfiddlemarch a study of provincial life by george eiiot in four volumev blackwood 1 many theresas have been born who found for them i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with t he meanness of opportunity perhaps a tragic failure f vhich found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion 1 with dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness for these laterborn t1cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other k oudemned as a lapse we need to recall those sentences in the prelude  to  middlemarch  in order to reconcile ourselves to its finale in which our last glimpse of george eliots modern theresa is as a comfortable matron very properly devoted to her second husband and only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother any other novelist would have ended the novel differently and with a good deal more stageeffect but george eliots finding is the true one and if we part from dorothea with somi regret that her first great failure as the wife of mr iasaubon should have no better compensation than the very prosaic success of a marriage with will ladislaw it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befall the worthiest natures while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy the most carefully mwrought out of all george eliots novels with the exception perhaps of romola  middlemarch  is also the most uelancholy in its tone it is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of haracter that go to make up our commonplace society and the impression left by this  study of provincial life  is one of pftinful but healthy sadness there is nothing of the misanthrope in george eliot if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world she does so altogether in order to help on their correction and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preachers sermons but we have no more right to look for shallow merrymaking in her books than to seek amusement from  ecclesiastes or  lamentations she does not preach that  all is vanity and vexation of spirit or that  the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied  but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered it is with others in their various ways as with dorothea whose later life is the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions among the ay oek a her mises it was never maid in t ighborood of middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own ageon modes of education which make a womans knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondlyasserted beliefs while this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe there will be collisions such as those in dorotheas life where great feelings will take the aspect of error and great faith the aspect of illusion dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in mid dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round we see her first in striking con trast to her simpleminded sister celia and her as simpleminded uncle mr brooke as a highsouled young woman  enamoured of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes the rashness causes her to embrace mr casaubon the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness until all her  vague ideals  have to give place to  the common yearning of womanhood in noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change we have seen how gradually dorothea loses faith in her husband without swerving at all in her duty towards him even as the most exacting purist might define it and how as gradually the way is prepared for her devotion after her husbands death to his cousin will ladislaw it is not easy to like young ladislaw one is tempted to think that in marrying him dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying mr casaubon how much pleasanter it would have been for lydgate to be her husband but unfortunately things do not always go pleasantly in real life and the fate that befalls dorothea is very natural though not very welcome lydgates fate is harder than dorotheas this portrait of the brave man of science whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallowhearted beauty is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of dorothea lydgate and rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of  middlemarch and in tracing their history george eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an illassorted marriage not the consequences with which novelreaders are familiar in which the silly wife runs away from her husband or the husband is a brute to his wife but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken perhaps george eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show  oh it is hard says dorothea to him that all this should come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways there is no sorrow i have thought more about than thatto love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail if selfish rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to dorothea unselfish mary garth is a no less complete foil of another sort the really pleasantest portions of  fiddle march are those that recount the sayings and doings of lmary and her father caleb garth and caleb garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent welldoing that makes no pretence tovirtue asexcellent in itswayisthe study of nicholas bulstrode the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied bulstrode3 downfall is described with great i ability and perhaps the best part of the description is f this which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she  has heard of his wrongdoings and of the worse doings r attributed to him t she locked herself in her room she needed time to get used s to her maimed consciousness her poor lopped life before she  could walk steadily to the place aotted her a new rgicbin light had fallen on her husbands character and she could not j ge him leniently the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit he had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal but this imperfectlytaught woman whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork had a loyal spirit within her the man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life and who had unvaryingly cherished hernow that punishment had l fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him tihere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul withering it the more by uloving proximity she knew when she locked her door that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow and say of his guilt i will mourn and not ixcproach but she needed time to gather up her strength she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife when she had resolved to go down she prepared herself by t ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker tiey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation she took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1ack gown and instead of wearing her muchadorned cap and large bows of hair she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b netcap which made her look suddenly like an early methodist bulstrode who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well had spent the time in an agitation co aal to hers he had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others and had acquiesced in that probability as something easier to him than any confession but now that he imagined the amelnt of her knowledge come he awaited the result in anguish liii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him and tiiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him he had not touched it he felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery perhaps he should never see his wifes face with affection in it again and if he turned to god there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution it was eight oclock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered he dared not look up at her he sat with is eyes bent down and as she went towards him she thought he looked smallerhe seemed so withered and shrunken a moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair and the other on his shoulder she said solemnly 1 t kindly look up nicholas he raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half damazed for a moment her pale face her changed mourning css the trembling about her mouth all said  i know  and her hands and eyes rested gently on him he burst out crying and tiny cried together she sitting at his side they could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim or of the acts which had brought it down on them his confession was silent and her promise of faithfulness was silent openminded as she was she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire she could not say  how much is only slander and false suspicion   and he did not say  i ani innocent the charity of middlemarch is as notable as its wisdom in every way it is a book to be glad of and if it does not enhance george eliots fame it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians   i i  middlemarch saturday march 30 1s72 literature by george eliot book iii waiting for death blackwood  sons the third instalment of  middlemarch ends in doubta doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form old peter featherstone not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind is dying fast and vulturelike the featherstones and waules close round him with testamentary purpose brothers solomon and jonah and sisters martha and jane take bodily possession of stone court where are also installed mary garth of right and mrs viney and her son fred by mr featherstones request that the featherstones should hang together against the vineys is natural still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves and that there should be a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him no scrutiny however can open the secret of old peters iron box true to himself the old man snaps and snarls at everybody is oracular as to his will and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power in the night alone with mary garth he dies he has it seems made two wills of which he wishes to burn one but both remain  and upon their tenor hangs fred vineys life for fred has borrowed money with all belief in his powers of repayment  having the superfluous securities of hope at his command and mary garths father has backed freds bill and fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh and  not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people is now in most unhappy plight seeing himself in his true light as a pitiful rascal who is robbing other people of their savings but it is not for fred and mary alone that the plot is thickening lydgatehow or why it would be as hard to say as in real life  finds himself engaged to rosamond viney and mr viney who is expecting stone court for fred has given his consent to the arrangement  with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch for  the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action and mr viney has discovered that old featherstones death is only his  demise and  considered as a demise old featherstones death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity1 and besides lydgate and rosamond dorothea too claims our interest as mr casaubon is too clearly dying fastindeed has a fit which can have but one meaning and dorotheas future is still further perplexed by the fact that mr brooke who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men has asked young will ladislaw to stop with him  feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas and more than all exactly as  old and young put the riddle of which the answer lies in  waiting for death so in  waiting for death  a riddle is put in the thirtieth chapter the answer to which is even harder to guess and ought to be the hinge of the tale for the rest  middlemarch is itself celia is to become lady chettam and is very full of happiness mr brook is more happily vague than ever his advice to casaubon after his fit being  yes yes get dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings and shuttlecock now i dont know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime i remember it all the fashion to be sure your eyes might not stand that casaubon but you must unbend you know why you might take to some light study  conchology now  i always think that must be a light study or get dorothea to read you light things smollett roderick random humphrey clinker they are a little broad but she may read anything now shes married you know i remember they made me laugh uncommonlytheres a droll bit about a postilions breeches we have no such humour now i have gone through all these things but they might be rather new to you and we have one or two new actors such as mr horrock the horsedealer  whose costume at a glance gives him a thrilling association with horses and whom nature has blessed with  a face which by dint of mongolian eyes and a nose mouth and chin seeming to follow his hatbrim in a moderate inclination upwards gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind and when accompanied by adequate silence likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding an infinite fund of humourtoo dry to flow and probably in a state of immovable crustand a critical judgement which if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it would be the thing and no other and with mr horrock is mr trumbull the auctioneer who is  an amateur of superior phrases never using poor language without immediately correcting himself aud who if anybody had observed of him that mr borthrop trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that still more heavily outlined is solomon featherstone who  thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellowmen inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there  coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others and there is also mrs plymdale who  doesnt think that marrying is everything and indeed  would have a girl first seek the kingdom of god  but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters and so holds that  a girl should keep her heart within her own power what the end of  middlemarch may be we hardly wish to guess its chief interest is as a study of english life the action does not absorb us as in  adam bede and the mill ou the floss there are too many actors for that and too many threads woven into the one strand  but as a thoughtful anatomy of english habits and english modes of thought full of dry quiet humour waiting for death is worthy its author whether  middlemarch as a whole will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails remains to be seen certainly as yet each part has been perfect of itself,biography
