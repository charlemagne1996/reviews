B6156,['6849413'],  vandover and the brute fiction by frank norris wm heinemann 6s the manuscript of this novel supposed to have been destroyed in the great fire of san francisco was found in a crate of various contents with the name of the author cut away by some unknown autographhunter and the book is now published with a brief foreword by mr charles norris his brother it is a crude but powerful story not to be compared with the pit or other works from the same hand but with passages here and there which a critic might note as foreshadowing a splendid future the brute is vandover himself his lower nature which in the end gains the mastery but there was no need whatever to drag in the horrors of lycanthropy to deepen poor vans downfall indeed the very chapters which the young author evidently wished to make impressive fail entirely they are simply unreal it is admitted that the influence of zola is strong in this first of frank norriss novels but no one as far as we know has noticed that much of the book reads extremely like a translation vandover starting as a harvard man has every chance of success in life but is especially susceptible to drink gambling and the influences of the saloonlife which he freely followed his power as an artist is gradually sapped by nervous disease and here the book goes to pieces it is well worth reading for its admirable opening chapters and its description of the family and social life of the city of san francisco there is no escaping the suggestion of a fine ability halfdeveloped and the reader will once more regret that the author was fated so soon to leave an art of which he would have been a master,omance_contra

B15,"['8467653', '4973077']",  the literary examiner danish fairy legends and tales by hans chris tian andersen pickering this is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated but why the tales should he called danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a dane is the author there is an occasional northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped all the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe at times it is even painfully so we have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd we begin to feel as mrs gulliver did when her husband returned from houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species we need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these when johnson laughed at goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of animateil xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales there is no such confusion of ideas in mr hans christian andersen his whales and his little fish all talk in character we are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas for his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality there is a pathetic daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue  and in another story there is a leatter ball of so aristocratical a character that when proposals are made to her by a pegtop because they happen to have been companions in the same drawer she indignantly asks him whether he is aware that her father and mother were morocco slipjiers and that she has  cork in her body we are here however it may be said confusing the specific and the superinduced character mr andersen keeps all clear he has so just a sense of the necessity of adhering to verisimilitude and of the forgetfulness of it on the part of writers in general that he introduces one of his stories with a remark that ought to become proverbial  in china the emperor is chinese esome of his descriptive touches recall the wonderful observation and exquisitely graphic felicity of mr dickens there is a wretched little hut in the tale of the ugly duclding  so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing admirable is the picture of the stork parading about on his long red legs discoursingin egyptian which language he had learned from his mother who does not feel that egyptian ls the very language that by way of accomplishment a stork would know  the touches of tnis kind are innumerable the fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence you desire occasionally something more childish and less clever and some of the stories nre too long but the genius and refinement are undeniable we must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums but with all the fairy fancy of the volume in general perhaps the beet story nevertheless if that whkh k least mirylike it rn celled the bmpem nemcbmm voaumvmbtkhm westra of the spirit of humbug ead of the way in wbicb the

literature of the critic that notice attracted to them considerable attention and translations were immediately commenced in various quarters the first that has made its appearance is now before us exquisitely printed at the aldine press and tastefully bound so as to form a birthday gift or school prize as attractive in external appearance as it will prove in its contents which are precisely such as youth most loves to read appealing at once to the imagination aud the heart conveying the morality of poetry and the poetry of morality an dersen has succeeded beyond all modern writers in catching the spirit as wvell as the manner of the legendary lore of his country it may be that he has only remodelled fables already current among the peasantry of denmark but even if he be not the inventor he is entitled to much applause for the skill with which he has put them into presentable shape without divesting them of the simplicity of language and the air of childlike faith in their literal truth which are essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former andersen writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung in this lies the  charm of his legends and tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends the translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple english so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children as specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends what poetry there is in the daisy listen to my story  in the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have i seen it in front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by i white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the i palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy i the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon i the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre it never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among i the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasf singing in the air the daisy was as happy as if it were they day of some high festival and yet it was only monday the c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good god is meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  i can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me oh how richly am i blessed 94 there stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves the peonies puffed themselves out in order to ai make themselves larger than the roses the tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen they took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them how happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy in and knew not what to think she was so surprised the little to bird hopped about and sang  oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white ihow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky it was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was but the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger as i to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant the poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all over with them the girl then went away with the i tulips how glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  she felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves is went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird the next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being born up by his wings in the open air the poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  the little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything all at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips they went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it i tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  no g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage but the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to ihim much as she wished to do so thus passed the whole imorning  there is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  alas  i must i die i must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which god has created  and then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  they have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which i possessed before  every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower alas  thou only remindest me of what i have lost  oh that i could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower the bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower it was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire the flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground the boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly they dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed but the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him what a moral in the buckwheat if after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should i you ask the reason the peasant will tell you that the lightning has done it but how is it that the lightning has i done it  i will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat this willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair there were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch the cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility but there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  i am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides i am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the i blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  and the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  yes indeed i do  but the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  the stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his body  c now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat lowever in his pride still stood erect t  bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  i have no c need said the buckwheat  bow thy head as we do said  i the corn  the angel of storms comes flying hitherward hei h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will it strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  no i will not bow said the buckwheat close thy i p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  so inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat now then i vid look right into gods nr heaven and in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking such was the flash that it southeast seemed as if the whole world was in flames when the tem southeast pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field e a dead useless plant and the old willowtree waved its branrelse to and fro in the wind  and large drops of water th fell from the green leaves as though the tree wept and the of svarrows asksd  winv weepest thou  it is so beautiful here  to see howvthe sun shines  how the clo uds pass ever the clear i sky  hvw sweet is the fragrance of the flowers 1whv then a eellest thou old willowtree  ard the

tale endt what sly satire in n the emperors new clothes iad many years ago there was an emperor who was so exces mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  he is sitting in council it was always said of him  the he emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or id who was extraordinarily simple in character  these must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the emperor  had i as i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the v wise from the foolish  this stuff must be woven for me im r mediately and he caused large sums to be given to both id the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly to so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected be to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all ie they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold it thread put both into their own knapsacks and then con e tinned their pretended work at the empty looms until late at e night  i should like to know how the weavers are getting g on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some ie little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed is when he remembered that a simpleton or one unfit for his goffice would be unable to see the manufacture  to be sure ht lie thought i he had nothing to risk in his own person but n yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him in 0 telligence about the weavers and their work before he e troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  i will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more i suitable for his office than he is so the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms v what can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d i cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover any thing on the looms for a very good reason viz there was nothing there  what  thought he again is it possible that i am a simpleton  i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so can it be that i am unfit for my office no that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see thestuff 1 well sirminister said one of the knaves still pretending to work  you do not say whether the stuff plleases you  oh it is excellent  replied the old minister loking at the loom through his spec tacles  this pattern and the coloursyes i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them w e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat

complete approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms for on no account would lie say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see no more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed  oli how beautiful  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material for the approaching procession magnificent charming  excellent  resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the euperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of  gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the emperors new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them 1 see  cried they at last  the emperors new clothes are ready  and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers  andl the rogues raised their arms as if in the act of holding something up sayings  here are your majestys trowsers here is the scarf here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb one might fancy one has nothing at all on when dressed in it that however is the great virtue of this delicate cloth  yes indeed  said all the courtiers although not one of them could see any thing of this exquisite manufacture  if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes we will fit on the new suit in front of the lookingglass the emperor was accordingly undressed and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit the emperor turning round from side to side before the lookingglass h how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes and how well they fit  every one cried out  what a design what colours  these are indeed royal robes   the canopy which is to be born over your majesty in the procession is waiting announced the chief master of the ceremonies  i am quite ready answered the emperor 1 do my new clothes fit well  asked he turning himself round again before the lookingglass in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit the lords of the bedchamber who were to carry his majestys train felt about ou the ground as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle and pretended to be carrying something for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity or unfitness for their office so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession through the streets of his capital and all the people standing by and those at the windows cried out  oh how beautiful are our emperors new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to the mantle and how gracefully the scarf hangs  in short no one would allow that he could not see these muchadmired clothes because in doing so he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones but the emperor has nothing at all on  said a little child  listen to the voice of innocence  exclaimed his father and what the child had said was whispered from one to another  but he has nothing at all on  at last cried out all the people the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the processionx must go on now and the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever to appear holding up a train although in reality there was no train to hold,omance_contra

a low aid vulgar type and with the improvement we ay mentioned we fnd in this novel evidences ths the authoress of  cometh up as a flower has uot forsaken the sins of her literary youth we have the same gross and degrading conception of human nature the same spasmodic lovemaking to digniff the exhibition of animal assion by such a on the part of fullbloodd and smallbrained men and maidens and everywhere the same evided of very bad taste indeed what the book wants is an ostler into whose mouth the authoress migt havet put her reflections upon human nature it is too bad that our daughters

are concerned the play is a tragedy  vanity fair is a novel without a hero but this play has a true hero though one who is ugly and grotesque the scene opens in 1640 when charles i was on the throne of england when louis xiii reigned and richelieu ruled in france m rostand gives us the body form and pressure of the time and we are transported into the days of the great cardinal the hero is surrounded by many figures typical of the time and we live in the period of the annen rg4ine we meet with the young gallants especially rostands darling gay gascons who are so handsome so featherheaded so dashing and so brave and we also get a glimpse of the starving poor poets who are eager to find bread and patrons the nobles are protected by court and cardinal favour and we feel around us the characteristics of the life of 1640 in paris m rostand can paint manners there is a colour of resemblance between m rostand and alexandre the great both writers feel deeply the sentiment of tarme blanche and delight in duellists de premiere force in cyrano we find a strain of dartagnan and of bussy damboise though they who are also magnificent swordsmen are graceful handsome and well favoured while poor cyrano is morbidly conscious of his terrible personal defects dumas splendid fencers resemble cyrano as bretteurs but as that only since they are by no means so great of soul and heart as is cyrano they are glorious but cyrano is a glory m rostands comedy is in the highest sense french as regards style but it is not very french in essence it is not based upon adultery madame

manly play and can be read or seen with delight as great as admiration the heroine is wholly womanly and entirely chaste the love is the honourable love of lady and of cavalier and there is behind the love that thinks only of marriage the noble the sublime selfsacrifice of a man who is a glorious example of high thoughts seated in a heart of honour and who is despite his nose an ideal hero of romance and even of something higher than romance cyrano foregoes his own chance of happiness and serves his neighbour to his own infinite detriment and deepest sorrow he is lacking in facial beauty but is not wanting in the highest beauty and majesty of the soul in the whole play is nothing foul nauseous or base the tone of the  heroic comedy  always maintains itself at a lofty level and we the seeing auditors or readers are uplifted to a healthy and virile frame of mind there is nothing in the work that can cause disgust and there is nothing that needs pitying excuse the drama opens in the

announcing the entry of the terrible cardinal into a box concealed by a grating montfleury commences the play when a voice criescoquin northeast taije pas interdit pour un mois  and this line is the first one spoken by cyrano de bergerac of course a tumult arises among the audience and there is excitement opposition noise and clamour cyrano exclaims to those near himje vous en prie ayez piti6 de

actresses flirting the gay procession marches on to the ambuscade placed and waiting at the port de nesle act ii opens in ragueneaus  r6tisseric des pobtes in which phoebus r6tisseur dispenses food in exchange for flattery to starving poets cyrano has a rendezvous with roxane at this boutique and while awaiting her coming he writes to her a letter of adoration the fame of his great feat of arms is

captain and the cadets enter all of them in raptures with the splendid fight of the hero who seems so indifferent to his glory and is so heartbroken by the defection of roxane de guiche brings his homage and cyrano sings his gascon song with its splendid swing and lilt when introducing the cadets to de guiche ce sont les cadets de gascogne de carbon de casteljaloux bretteurs et menteurs sans

avant plge la moindre allusion au fatal cartilage  but the handsome dolt de neuvillette ignorant of the interview with roxane dares to insult the hero on this tender point cyrano masters himself and does not resent an insult from the man that roxane loves in his generosity in his lofty chivalry towards a woman he soothes and advises the vaguely jealous cadet who soon withdraws all his insults he feels however that he has not the gift of talking love and christians feelings wrench from cyrano the admission that if he were handsomer jaurais 6 de ceux qui savent en parler and he proposes that they shall collaborer un peu tes sevres et mes phrases je serai tonne esprit tu seras ma beaut4 and cyrano gives to christian the letter which he had written to declare his love to roxane the anxious cadets return and find cyrano and christian embracing each other they had expected to find the rash insulter slain by the terrible blade of the great tireur christian is to be helped to make love but no one thinks of the sad warfare going on in the great heart of the unspeakably noble cyrano we learn to know him better than roxane did and as we feel with his feelings and watch his actions we realise that we are studying a character that may be reverenced as sublime roxane liked him well enough to use him for herself and for her lover but she had not insight enough to comprehend the magnanimous soul or the poetical intellect of the great brave man whose services she commanded while she wholly failed to estimate him aright or to reward him at all he won but feeble gratitude from the woman for whose sake he sacrificed his happiness and hopes act iii is picturesquely entitled le baiser deroxane it is certain that christian could never left to himself obtain such a favour from the fairest fair but it may be that the eloquent cyrano could obtain it for him oh the pathos of the many pangs and tortures which the blind lady can inflict upon the sensitive heart and lofty nature of her noblest adorer  her way of talking about and praising the l2te christian must have been an agony to the devoted friend and cousin whobut for his nosecould so well have wooed and won her for his worthy and lofty self the scene of this act is aplate place before the house of roxane and the time is night oh what a peerless and loyal gentleman is our dear cyrano  we should pity him more if he were not so strong so noble and so true his towering virtues rob him in part of our sympathy they speak thus of christianroxanl ah i quil eat beau quil a desprit et que je raime  cyvno souriat

untenable position de guiche observes of christian that he is beam mais wie the troops should depart at once but the amorous and influential count proposes to delay his departure for a day in order to see roxane again that night infatuated christian becomes tired of being assisted by the cultured clever cyrano to letters and to conversation and determines to speak for himself cyrano regrets well knowing what the result will be and he judges rightly christians own talk to roxane is so bald and dreary that he disgusts his brilliant mistress who rigorously demands esptit from her lover and the dullard in despair cries to cyrano au secours  with marvellous selfrestraint the highhearted rival proposes to whisper to christian what he  cyrano should say to roxane who believes that she is listening to the man she loves so successful is cyrano that he soon wins back her favour for the fortunate young dolt who is so bite once carried away by excitement cyrano feels jose 6tre enfin

et je pleure et je taime et suis tienne et tu mas enivrie  enraptured christian whispers to cyrano to ask her for a kiss for him and the almost superhumanly unselfish hero does ask and does obtain this favour for the dullwitted handsome young baron there must have been a fierce struggle in that great heart before cyrano could obtain that kiss for christian but he does even more and brings about the marriage of christian and roxane he actually does even this and finally gives away to another the woman that he lovesas he could lovewhile knowing that the only merit of christian is that she loves him left to his own resources the young baron could never have wooed or won roxane the qualities that she loves in christian are those which really belong to the ugly gifted poet cavalier de guiche comes to visit the lady who is even then marrying the cadet cyrano manages to detain the count for a quarter of an hour while the hasty marriage is being celebrated he does this by an entrancing narrative written with perhaps almost the most fantastic wit exhibited in recent comedy even the detained de guiche is interested and delighted but cyranos soufrances mudells must have been terrible during his wild mock narrative of a descent from the moon roxane cleverly deceives the stupid catucin into marrying her to christian de guiche is stupefied but leaves at once to join his regiment then starting for the war and compels the unfortunate bridegroom to accompany him roxane implores cyrano to watch over and guard her husband who is of course to be kept from cold and kept

majesty of france has neglected to supply his troopsor at least the gay gasconswith provender and our cadets are faint and sick with hunger roxane wished to hear often from christian and cyrano writes to her twice a day in the name of the ignorant christian and daily risks his life in conveying his letters to her through the spanish lines to the post but a glory comes to the famishing camp a

out of the carriage appear galantine ortolans a peacock trujey red and white wine and even champagne and the joyous gascons have a magnificent and necessary picnic while the forlorn post of danger becomes filled with a charming party gay cheerful delighted in order that he may not appear ignorant when questioned by roxane cyrano tells christian how often he had written to roxane letters purporting to come from her husband  you have written to her much oftener than you thought you had explains cyrano who makes light of having daily risked his life when asked why she came roxane

who has become the ducmardchal de grammont and has greatly aged but she receives the constant visits of the unwaveringly faithful cyrano roxane wears upon her heart the last letter which cyrano had written to her in the name of christian and she is faithful to the memory of the dead cyrano has fallen into poverty and misery ses ipitres lui font des ennemis nouveaux ii attaque les faux nobles les

been stained cyrano was a kind of chivalrous saint of clearest honour and a most terrible and gallant swordsman he was also poet genlihomme and an incomparable lover m rostand could not of course let his matchless swordsman perish by the sword but yet we feel with a kind of tender resentment that a couh de ckih is an undignified method of assassination for such a cavalier the object clearly was to kill cyrano by a means which though certainly fatal in the end would yet work so slowly that it would give him time for a last scene and this end could perhaps have been better attained by a gunshot wound we feel sometimes that the long persistent blindness of poor roxane is scarcely credible a womanand such a womanmust have discerned the passion in cyranos lofty heart must have detected the invaluable help rendered to christian it is true that m rostand has ingeniously hidden so far as possible the assistance rendered by cyrano but a womans fine intuition is not so easily deceived and we must doubt whether his duplicity would be more effective than her insight the ideal cyrano worships only his one goddess never descends to baser or stoops to lighter loves he is capable of perfect and selfdenying reverence for woman and as is the case only with rare spirits love with cyrano has so smitten the chord of self that it has passed in music out of sight he has overcome selfa conquest how hard and how glorious but he is so much the victim of his exalted altruism that we are at times led to fancy that despite rostands art such selfsacrifice even from such a royal gentleman is almost exaggeration is all but incredible if only roxane could have read his heart she would surely especially after her widowhood not have refused him his wellearned and nobly merited reward and this even in spite of his nose by the way cyranos eyes must have been wonderful they were grey i think and full of expression melting in love or kindling in war expressing courage purity tenderness or sacred rage she must have rightly estimated christian if cyrano had not helped the baron and she could not understand de bergerac mainly because she was so absorbed in fondness for his inferior rival but if she had in time recognised the royal nature of cyrano and had rewarded him with the love for which he yearned so wildly if she had done that we should never have had the tragedy of the hidden passion which was detected so lateso sadly too late oh the pity of it iago  one of the most subtle touching novel ideas in the play is that roxane who consciously loves christian is in so doing ignorantly loving her greater lover cyrano she really loved the fine qualitiesthe courage wit genius magnanimityof that most generous rival in all romance cyrano but he in devoted unselfishness lent his high qualities to the man who was in consequence to succeed in winning that love of roxane which cyrano so desired and deserved she really loved the beauty of christian and the soul of de bergerac in

intended it to be funny far from it indeed it is the authors perfect unconsciousness of saying anything humorous that makes us laugh so the book is written with such profound gravity and selfcomplacency that what would otherwise be insufferable becomes very amusing we remember a parallel case some time ago there was an   i flr    amateur representation of  macbeth to which the numerous friends of the actors were compelled to go with anything but lively anticipations of enjoyment to their delight what was expected to bea most tedious affair turned out a perfect success macbeth was so wonderfully  got up and delivered his speeches with such preternatural solemnity and was evidently so delighted with himself and his acting that the audience roared again every syllabic he uttered caused shouts of laughter much to his astonishment but s hestillweuton in thc sam style he unwittingly kept up the fun to thc end of the enteiiaiinitnt by these means a badlyacted tragedy became a most enjoyable farce so hero thanks to our appreciation ot the humorous a tedious novel is made really amusing were it not for this we fear our criticism would be more severe as it is though author is perfectly safe we cannot find much fault with a book that has made us laugh so the author says in the third volume of  north of the tweed that it is not a novel at all perhaps this is some peculiar fun of mr crowberry some joke known only to a few for if it is not a novel what is it we really cannot say it certainly is not a book of travels nor a book of anecdotes it is perhaps best described as an edd and not very agreeable mixture of the three things the first volume so lav as we can judge was apparently intended for a novel at any rate there is some appearance of a tale  but to the readers surprise and our amusement this story comes to an abrupt termination at the end of the volume the second volume has no reference to the firstnor in faet t lung at all iii particular the hero of the first volume certainly appears iu though second but that is the only connexion between them it puzzles us to make out what mr crowberry intended the second volume to be we have thought over it and as a puzzle it h amusing but it beats us we cannot understand what it means it is such a curious medley that it must be read to be appreciated we warn the reader though that tue only entertainment he can hope to find is in wondering at the incongruities and pomposity of style beyond this he will be bored in the third volume the author takes another stait and having satisfied his taste for meandering in the second volume rathor inclines to give his audience another story this intention however is not strictly carried out for the meandering continue at diverse intervals throughout the last volume but still there is some kind of reference to a talc for which the reader will feel grateful or not according to his taste even the author shows once in the como of his work symptoms of an idea that it is not quite cn rijlc to drag into his novel stray anecdoteof about eighty pages or so wliei it has not the remotest connexion with what precedes and follows it and when mr crowberry himself owns that it is not amusing this remarkable once occurs at page 172 of the third volume we specify it thus particularly as it possesses a certain interest for though philosophical critic it proves that even though most eccentric author has occasional glimpses of right and wrong in reference to his novel just as the most depraved criminal occasionally exhibits signs of penitence and remorse so the author at this remarkable page 172 shows that even he knows what crimes he has been guilty of as a novelwriter this is what mr crowberry says   were we now engaged in writing a novel  it would become our first consideration to choose or invent such incidents for our work as seemed best calculated to sustain an uniform interest or stimulate the curiosity of those who honoured us with their favour such may be termed the high or popular road of romance but as we are occupied in recording a succession of humble events either relating personally to the subject of our narrative or coming directly under his observation in the courso of his rambling life ice are constrained to dealicith matters as they come before us commonplace as they may seem the present incident    possesses nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or cen to a place in our pages nothing beyond the actual fact of its existence enid of having attained consielereible notoriefy at the time of its occurrence observe in the beginning of this quotation how the guilty author tries to excuse himself while confessing his crime how natural this is  no man ever acknowledged himself guilty of a crime without a reservation the confession always nins  i know i did it but and the  but clearly proves it was some one elses fault that the crime in question was committed but what does mr crowberry mean by saying were we now engaged in writing a novel really when we listen to excuses like this we feel quite inclined to lose our good humour and be severe how can mr crowberry be so cool as to say that he is  constrained to deal with matters as they come before him commonplace as they may seem   who constrains him  certainly not the public in fact we cannot see how an englishman can be compelled to write a book though he had even contracted to do so the court of chancery itself would never decree specific performance of a contract to write a book it may be different in scotland  but even if it be so the courts in scotland ought clearly not to have constrained mr crowberry to publish his book in england there must be some mistake somewhere seriously mr crowberry is in this dilemma either he wrote to please the public or to please himself and a few friends in the first case it is clear he ought not to have wilfully written trash that he knew to be uninteresting to the public generally in though second case mr crowberry should have printed a few copies for private circulation when he published the book to the world the excuse as to his being compelled to write nonsense fell to the ground  for though he and his friends may prefer uninteresting and disconnected stories they have no right to force their peculiar taste on the public at large to conclude mr crowberry ought not to spoil a good confession by frivolous excuses the simple truth is the author knew to use his own words that the incident possessed nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or even to a place in his pages yet out of pure obstinacy he inserted it i knew i ought not to stead that coat and yet i did steal it that is the authors

will live for forgiveness thus far the archangel michael and tosses the volume into the appropriate scale but while it is falling we who have not the sense of eternal values may with propriety ask ourselves another question was the volume written sincerely say no and nothing else need be said the tiger in 1898 was off his feed so he turned out a novel but say  yes and some interesting considerations ensue the great and successful statesman whose iron will has modified history is giving us his impressions of the world where he was so active the book now becomes as precious as the confessions of aurelius or the poems of frederick the great france clemenceaus lodestar for whom he would have died for whom he has urged millions to die france for whose sake he has outwitted humanitarians and economists and ruined europefrance is about to reemerge from his mind in the form of fiction one reads with an awe which seems to have sustained most critics to the end but at last a new emotion asserts itself boredom france and its contents appear to be dead pinch the book where you will and it does not move not only are the characters  dead  in the technical sense being mere bundles of qualities but the scenery the social face of paris is also defunct which is most surprising considering the writers career he to whom all sections of society must have been open reads as if he had never been anywhere or seen anything compare his account of a costly evening party with miss daisy ashfords or if this test be too severe with anything out of alphonse daudet or thackeray hum of life vividness of detailshe transmits neither vague rhetoric and clumsy satire are all that he achieves until one cannot believe that georges clemenceau was ever invited to any evening party costly or cheap the chapters about the factory and the modistes are equally extinct and the pall is provided by the cloud of sentimental morality of which specimens have already been given and which envelops the whole af air is it thus that he conceives our civilization  the obvious reply is  no he conceives it otherwise as his actions prove do not make so much fuss he happens not to be a good novelist and there the mystery ends but does it end may not clemenceau have correctly transcribed his most sacred visions and his books and his life be one  human nature is so eerie that the possibility must be contemplated the paris he fought for may be the paris he depicts the justice he talks about may like the justice he writes about be nothing but the moral perspiration that is incidental to an elderly man his acts like his art may be built round a void and if we could enter his mind we might find in it only the feeblest image of the world that we love little is known about the psychology of  greatness for naturally impressed by the men who rule our fortunes we adopt in all ranks a modest attitude towards them we assume that a statesman who feels strongly about france feels a france that is fine and that his sensations are more vivid than our own although he may not be able to express them artistically yet hints to the contrary occur and  the strongest  confirms them its mediocrity is so complete as to suggest that clemenceau sees our lovely and tragic earth as a halflit picture where youths kill one another and emperors fall and boundaries are readjusted in terms of universal insipidity all is relative and of course his germany is less valuable than his france but is his france as valuable as ones own germany  and at the last judgement a strange miracle may occur  the strongest though thrown by an angelic hand may fail to reach either pan of the scales for which it is destined it will be too light lighter than air it will float in the final wind and be blown into limbo the deeds of the novelist the blood and the tears that he caused the victories that he won for his countrythey will remain and by them he will be judged and assigned to his appropriate eternity

of twentyfive wrote it and after undergoing trial by courtmartial was condemned to six months imprisonment anad to le dismissed the service finally in the pre ence of the german parliament the

and it is said is enjoying a wide circulation throughout the empire under the innocent and honourable title of  ivanhoe of course these proceedings drew the attention of the world to the book to an extent the author had never expected he had wearied of his life in forbach the little frontier town where as he says the  undesirable elements of the army were gathered together he watched his fellow officers make love to other mens wives he saw them illtreating their inferiors he came across eavesdropping fraud and cowardice he was disgusted by their squabbles and their coarseness he decided to throw up his profession but before he was out of harness he wrote and published   life in a garrison town by lieutenant bilse 6s john lan1e  a chronicle of things as he saw them whether he has

gentlemen of the german army and to do the author justice he is careful to defend himself against such a charge it is life in a little  garrison town that he describes the scourings of the army and not its main body to the ignorant outsider there seems something wrong in a system that collects the scourings instead of dispersing them or throwing them out but even an outsider who knows the german

one individuality upon another can be traced to a greater or lesser extent in the present work the author seeks to show the outcome of its greatest manifestation and makes a plausible story but in spite of his professoi who investigates the case in the interests of science we are left much where we were before and not too well satisfied with mr hichens if we are to regard him seriously as a psychologist his work arouses our interest but we cannot say that it adds to his considerable reputation  fiction a case of soul transference the dweller om the threshold i  a  by robert hichens

expectation  will it be deemed a satisfactory effort of so accomplished an author we very much doubt whether it will enhance his literary reputation or will increase his hold upon the reading public there is a single theme and in effect a single character to engage the readers interest through some three hundred pages the theme is a perfectly simple one and not remarkable for novelty it is the transference of personality from one person to another as the result of indulgence in occult exercises the one character on whom the story hinges is the rev henry chichester who at one time was properly described as a gentle and cherubic clergyman chichester becomes senior curate at st judes under marcus harding the vicar chichester is as wax in the hands of harding who is a person of great mental and intellectual power as well as of a potent personality the vicar as a result of his wonderful power as a preacher draws immense congregations to the morning services at st judes the senior curate who preaches at the evening service delivers his discourses to empty pews shortly a marvellous change is observed the vicar loses all hold on his congregation is obviously unmanned and but a shadow intellectually of his former self simultaneously the cherubic curate develops a strenuous personality and is recognised as a preacher forceful and powerful as marcus harding used to be there are several lay figures in the book evelyn malling who is a disciple of professor stepton the latter a profound investigator into psychic problems there is also lady sophia wife of marcus harding but these characters are really used merely to unravel the mystery of the change which has come about in the personalities respectively of henry chichester and marcus harding hardirg apparently a devout religionist and morally immaculate is in reality neither he is continually haunted by doubts and unbelief he is not content with faith he wants proof in the hope of attaining his object he makes use of his power over the gentle and malleable curate he induces chichester to take part with him in seances held at the curates room to overcome the repugnance felt by chichester to this suggestion harding persuades him that his object is to transfer some of his power and personality to chichester the occult practises continue with the result that the powerful personality of harding isnot partially but whollygradually transferred to chichester harding feels all his power slipping away from him and instead of having the curate under his absolute control he himself becomes chichesters creatureunder a horrible subjection  to him the result is not only the loss of all his force as a preacher but also the loss of the love and respect of his wife lady sophia in the days of her husbands strength cordially despised and hated chichester but as the strength and personality of her husband was gradually transferred to the curate her contempt and revulsion devolve on her husband whom she incontinently leaves harding endeavouring to attribute his collapse to nervous dyspepsia tries to get away from the orbit of chichesters influence in vain chichester has only to make his will known and his slave is bound to returnto grovel in his serfdom we leave the dinouement to the readers of mr hichenss book the theme being so simplewhat of its treatment  the writing varies remarkably on some pages it is trivial commonplace and doubtfully grammatical on others occur passages which are strangely powerful and reach the highest standard of literature it is towards the end of the book

B434,"['8950977', '3173323', '6493493', '8700999']",  the strange adventures of a phaeton i the strange adventures of a phaeton by william black author of  a daughter of heth c c in two volumes macmillan mr black has always been skilful in giving to his books precisely the tone and atmosphere so to say needful for drawing out the fullest effects of his pictures and his new story with its queer title is quite a masterpiece in this way a party of four persons the narrator of the tale and his wife whom we only know here as queen titania or tita a young german officer fresh from the siege of paris and a perfect specimen of english girlhood who bears no other name in these pages besides bell set out from london in a phaetonandpair to drive to the faroff north countree  by a route which takes them through nearly every kind of english landscape  the river pictures about richmond then the wooded hills about oxfordshire then the plains of berkshire then the mere county about ellesmere a glimpse of the sea and the welsh mountains and then the lakedistricts of westmoreland and cumberland and the record of their journey has caught much of the charm of the brightness and colour and varied beauty of the lovely scenes they passed through and gives the reader just such a sense of airiness and easy movement as the travellers in that fortunate phaeton must themselves have enjoyed the words in which the nameless vates sacer of the journey speaks of it to his companions at its final stage exactly describe the general effect of the book we have done nothing that we ought to have done we have done everything that we ought not to have done as one of you has already pointed out we have never visited a museum or explored a ruin or sought out a historical scene our very course has been inconsistent abnormal unreasonableindeed if we were to imagine a sheet of lightning getting tipsy and wandering over the country in a helpless fashion for several days that might describe our route we have had no adventures that could be called adventures no experiences to turn our hair grey in a dozen hours only a general sense of light and fresh air and motion and laughter we have seen green fields and blue skies anti silver lakes we have seen bright mornings and breezy days and spent comfortable evenings in comfortable inns shall we not look back upon this month in our lives and call it the month of sunshine and green leaves a little rillet of a lovestory very prettily and skilfully brought in runs continuously through the book and affords it its element of human interest both bell and queen tita have been such ardent sympathisers with the losing side in the great war that they are at first disposed to resent the addition of a victorious lieutenant of uhlans to their party as a further wrong ani outrage to unhappy france besides there has long been a boyandgirl attachment between bell and one arthur ashburton and the young gentleman at any rate is inclined to regard her as lalwftlly belonging to him but he throws away all the awlvantags of his position by abandoning himself unreservedly to the impulses of furious jealousy comes upon the travellers now and again in the course of their journey like a ghost at a banquet turning their gaiety into gloom and apprehension as he thinks to enhance his power by boyish outbursts of illhumour and rudeness so he stands at a great disadvantage compared with the lieutenant always intelligent handy gay and goodnatured and not the less attractive in a girls eyes for the halo of martial story that hangs about him bell in process of time begins to discover that  count von rosen is always right  in his suggestions and opinions to know the songs he likes and sing them obediently and at last to profess as though the matter did not admit of dispute that german character literature and art fre a thousand times better than anything any other country in the world has to show and though she refuses the count once as a matter of conscience towards the illfated arthur she succumbs to a second attack and we leave the pair engaged lovers mr black has evidently a very close acquaintance with feminine ways and his two heroines here are as amusing as they are attractive the only point in the book to which we are inclined to take exception is the continual passagesatarms between queen titania and her husband of course we know that there is no malice in them that the combatants are only at play in their perpetual interchange of indignation and defiance but all the same after a time this mimic warfare becomes just a trifle of a bore but this blot is but of small weight as set off against the beauty and charm we have found in these pages the subject exactly suited the author and he has made the most of it and the result is a far higher and more complete success than we are by any means accustomed to meet with in novels of the day  the strange adventures of roger wilkins and other stories by r a andom illustrated tylton and edwards the effort after facetiousness spoils most of these stories but they have high spirits and ingenuity to set off against some vulgarity and overstrain of humour the titlestory reads like a poor imitation of mr anstey most of the others are more genuinely amusing the scheme of the desperate journalist to fleece the prosperous relatives of his friend the poet crane in  industry and sloth is ingeniously funny and  myrtle farm  may amuse a reader in a mood for farce but mr andoms fun is apt to seem rather professional  tiie strange adventures of lucy smith mr philips has broken fresh ground with a vengeance elsewhere he has mercilessly satirised the failings and vices of society he has given as a marvellously vivid analysis of the life of a deviance woman of the world and he has not refrained from exposing a dignitary of the church but in u lucy smith  he takes an excursion into the occult world he deals with the influence of mysterious and horrible forces and he presents to his startled readers a real live magician as malignant and demoniacal as any to be found in the 44 arabian nights yet the scene of this singular story is laid in england the time is the present and the young lady who undergoes these terrible experiences is no semidistraught heroine of romance but an average specimen of a soberminded healthy and attractive english girl mr philips is too true an artist to bewilder his readers with highflown language or mystical phraseology  he tells his amazing story in a simple and straightforward fashion thereby increasing the effect tenfold it wrould not be fair to disclose the plot of this singular book suffice it to say that it is one of extraordinary power and fascination and that the mystery arrests the attention of the reader at once and retains it down to the very last chapter the few characters there are really but five are portrayed in a masterly manner and we cannot but congratulate mr philips most heartily upon the success of a very bold experiment   the strange adventures of lucy plinth by f c philips author of  as in a lookingglass etc etc swan sonnenscheinlowrey  co paternoster square  the strange adventures of a phaeton by william black 2 vols macmillan  co the success of mr blacks daughter of heth will lead many readers to look forward with interest to what they understand from the advertisements to be his  new novel and they may be a little disappointed at discovering that the present work does not aspire to that title they will find in this book nothing more than the record of a pleasant ramble through some of the english counties taken by a party of four persons in a phaeton we can understand that the phaeton itself if it could think and if it bore in mind the normal limits of english drives would find it strange to be taken through berkshire oxfordshire worcestershire and shropshire to cross the mersey by a steam ferry to explore the lake country and at length to reach edinburgh but though from this point of view there is a reason for the name which mr black has given to his book we are certainly led to expect something more romantic and adventurous than the incidents of this journey one or two drives in the darkness some lovers quarrels proposals and their results coupled with an occasional difference of opinion with an ostler make up the  strange adventures  of the party we must add that this description includes only the smaller part of the book and that what we most care to dwell upon is the painting of scenery and character mr black brings out in a series of happy touches the striking features of each successive landscape from the wooded crags of cliefden to the still waters of rydal one after another the quiet lanes and swelling hills and sweeps of green meadow and copses of beech and oak come before the minds eye and each bit of scenery is rendered more attractive by being associated with the figure of a lovely girl whom mr black has skilfully placed in the foreground however aggrieved we may feel at the fate for which she is destined we know that the chief interest of the journey centres in her we watch her with new delight as each change in the landscape is reflected in her deepblue eyes and as the breezes fresh from the mountains and the sea play with the masses of her lightbrown hair looking at the post she fills we may partly reverse the title of  vanity fair and say that mr black has given us not  a novel without a hero but a heroine without a novel  the party to which we are introduced consists of the girl just sketched of a man and wife and of a prussian officer perhaps mr black has been somewhat lold in this choice at the present time more especially as he describes a most charming girl as forsaking an english lover for the prussian although that english lover is described as  a young gentleman at the temple and according to the attorneygenerals late speech at exeter most if not all good men have been lawyers however count von rosen as the exuhlan is called has many qualities which win our regard his courtesy his command of his temper his sociability his general usefulness his love of horses his frankness with men make him popular with all who are brought in contact with him of the other characters in the book there is not much to be said though they serve to set off the heroine and though there are some incidental touches of great merit bestowed on the other female member of the party mr black should have avoided the stale device of copious italics which marks the foot notes added to several chapters by the wife of the narrator and in the conjugal relations of the same parties there is a little too much repetition of a kind of sham fighting which is to say the least not wholly original the want of incident that has been mentioned already is most felt when we leave the charming pictures of scenery by which we are accompanied along the country roads the town life with which we are brought in contact wants sprightliness and mr black seems indifferent to local characteristics which a quicker eye or a longer experience would have enabled him to bring out yet we must not part from his book or let him part from us otherwise than in good humour that would be making a poor return for the pleasure he has given us,omance_contra
B5939,"['6614529', '8789641']",  one of our conquerors in 3 vols by george meredith chapman  hall tile works of a writer past tie prime of life are apt to display a certain excess or extravagance what was once his strength has now become his weakness and his virtue has changed into his vice this is most often seen in the case of very strong and masterful writers those whose good work is all done in some one annus mirabilis or flowering season fall into more decay as coleridge or as wordsworth it is in writers whose whole life has been full of successful toil and untiring effort that manner degenerates into mannerism such writers and indeed all artists of such a kind are often men who have discovered some new way in art and who possess a secret and a power proper to themselves the world used to the old and familiar ways will not at once take notice of them in proportion to their faith in themselves and their fidelity to their art these artists unshaken and undeterred continue upon their way rather increasing than relaxing their unappreciated labours slowly and gradually the world comes round to their side is converted to their faithwelcomes them with applause but what of the artists all this long time  is there no danger that in a kind of unconscious defiance and challenge they will have gone too far and grown enamoured of that in their work which the world did well to blame  if the world cried out upon their obscurity where there was some obscurity but not much was it not natural in them to have replied with worse obscurities out of an impatient contempt and exasperation  it is permissible to think that browning had a little of this feeling when he filled his later books with so much more argument than imagination landor dared to think that milton in paradise regained was  subject to strange hallucinations of the car now milton held although the world does not that paradise regained is superior to paradise lost it is as though foreseeing the  revel of rhyme  that was to supersede his greater harmonies he gathered himself together and went nigh to straining the resources of his rhythm beyond its just capacity it has been said of late that mr meredith in his new book has likewise exhibited  the defects of his qualities  that his former work reached the farthest limits of successful audacity and that one of our con querors has passed beyond them cordial and enthusiastic admirers of mr meredith are ringing the changes upon wilful eccentricity  and  wanton obscurity  and lack of proportion in design since the present writer is unable to share these opinions it is incumbent upon him to acknowledge that upon reading the book for the first time he did not reckon it a masterpiece read three or four times the book grows upon the reader the apparent confusion disappears the intricacies of design become intelligible and the whole greatness of design is evident hasty impression yields to careful meditation let us take first a question of style is one of our conquerors written in a style of grotesque and perverted eccentricity whilst richard 1ctere or thie egoist is full of true force and beauty  that can be maintained only by one who has not read mr merediths earlier books for a year at least one who retains a sense of their greatness forgetting all but their final and permanent effect again he who maintains that view muist have ignored this fact that with ir meredith style and subject change or grow together in proportion as the subject is simple or idyllic or tragic or humorous or rapid so does the style assume those qualities if the chief influences brought to bear upon the chief characters be influences of the great and busy world of crowded and coimplicated life then the style reflects the nature of those influences all air merediths books are full of stir and animation  but three of them in especial are full of this general or social life this business and animation felt in the very atmosphere in beauchamps career and diana of the crosswalls and one of our conquerors it is not too much to say that the world or  society or  the public or the nation seems to rank among the dramatis personae now most english writers who wish to make an effect of this kind to suffuse their work with this breath of the general life attempt it by pages of reflection and description in which the words are abstract and the sentences are sentiments unless the writer be very skilful his writing will 0 very dull at the best it will too often be mere rhetoric but air meredith differs in this from almost every other novelist of eminence  that he sees thoughts as things emotions as images the abstract as the concrete he has eyes for the form and colour of an idea he presents it to us full of life it is now a truism to say that a cause is identical with its effects but the illustration may help us out when an ordinary writer gives us an idea he gives it us in a dull and sparing way the implicit truth is there but it remains implicit he states as it were a cause air meredith states the effects the explicit operations of the cause  the thought is expressed in concrete terms his lively phrases are not metaphorical but logical the ideas are translated into their equivalent expressions in actual life those readers are surely wrong who regard mr merediths characteristic phrases as so many attempts at opigram and wit critics have publiihied lists of air merediths failures  in epigram they might as well be called his failures in epic all such characteristic phrases are rather faithful translations of general and abstract ideas into expressions of their concrete contents of meaning translations by a huiourist whose humour need not relish the phrase whicih may 10 ludicrous but the act of making it the discovery that do but examine such and such an idea and the phrase will he found to express it so that when mr moredith is accused of straining after wit he iz in reality but keeping close to facts which is apt to be a grimly serious form of humour it may not lie amiss to comparo with mr merediths manner of expressing ideas his maimer of expressing nature his poems for heenness of sight for close contact with the most precise details have few rivals  and here ho reverses his process and from an expression of the visible or the audible in nature ho passes to its meaning for man in thought in this way lie keeps touch with both sides of life  real and ideal analytic and synthetic  he cannot understand one without the other as is always the case with all true writers the consideration of mr merediths style passes insensibly into that of his subject it may be assuiiied that most readers of the ac y are now acquainted with hl f one oimpl rw  so t hat

retained of a shadow of obscurity the sight was keener than touch and the run of blood with blood to quicken slumbering seeds of passion  but here is the place ol broken ground and tangle which calls

portraits of mrs blachenoy and lady graco halley to say that the book is by mr meredith is to say that it is full to the brim of brilliant things the hand that dispensed the treasures of the  pilgrims

been proclaimed in open court returns into loving union with his wife having inherited a great fortune and by way of expiation for his wrongs to her redeems himself by a surgical featthe transfusion of blood from his living to her dying body this as all readers of anna sewards memoirs will remember was not au uncommon practice in the last century the lichfield swan offered her veins to be opened for lady northesk when she lay dying of inanition but let forgiveness be ever so celestial there is no condoning such outrages as mrs gaunt had suffered as little possible is such a superb marriage as mr read has made up for the wronged mercy vint the publicans puritan daughter and  the county having been made aware by pro oeedings of the courts of justice of the stories of the rival heroines would have countenanced neither wedded pair in place of entertaining them separately there are some things over which no mortal or to use a wellworn adjective conventional sponge can be passed even by mr3

with us but of really accomplished wellinformed women believe nie i found no deficiencyfar otherwise if the inclination or thc talent existed means and opportunity were not wanting for mental culture

were finished musicians painted like artists possesoil an extensive acquaintance with their evil literature and an uncommon knowledge of languages and were besides very good housewives after the

clothe his genius in thunder dip bis pencil in the lightning and the sunbeams of beaven and rush fearlessly upon a subject which others had trembled to approach ju both we sec a singular and extraordinary combination of the plainest coarsest realities of life with the loftiest imagery the most luxurious tints of poetry both had the same passion fur allegory and managed it with equal

winced permissions and wild destinies splendours and looms and ulinuntrii ir incarnations of hopes and tears unit twilight fantanes took form aud beingbecame palpable existences and yet with all this inventive power this love of allegorical fiction it is life the spirit of animal life diffused through and over their works  it is the blending of thc plain reasoning with splendid creative powers of

B7680,"['6806200', '3160573', '8844031']",  fiction a tale of the mutiny on the face of the waters by flora annie steel william heinemann mrs steels new story has been sj highly praised already vide press notices passim as quoted in the advertisements that if it were merely for the sake of a change one would be inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses there is a danger we hope it is no more that a somewhat uncritical admiration for the work of the clever lady who has now come to be spoken of as the female rudyard kipling  may do harm both to the authoress and her public the description is neither elegant nor correct for mrs steels resemblance to mr kipling begins and ends in the fact that both write about india from intimate personal knowledge and that the resemblance should strike both critics and public so forcibly is a remarkable sign of the novelty with which this inside handling of indian subjects came upon the masses in whose name our great dependency is ruled is it too much to express a fear that mrs steel has been tempted by thi reception to imagine that she has a mission to inform the british public about the true history of india  in her latest book at any rate the element of history seems to us entirely to overbalance the fiction we hasten to say that so far as the facts are concerned they are admirably portrayed mrs steels capacity as a historian of the indian mutiny is undeniable she is soaked through and through with knowledge of the environment in which she sets her story she is no partisan and her heroworship is combined with justice but after all fiction is fiction it is with some apprehension that the present writer who was one of the first to call attention to the power and beauty of those short sketches of mrs steels which came out anonymously in macmillans sees the authoress compelled to begin her new story with a preface insisting on its historical accuracy and explaining that it intended to be history as well as  story in her own criticism that in such an attempt she will probably fail in either aim mrs steel seems to us to be a better oritic of herself than most authors are it is not from a novelist that we want  every incident scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather it is not for the writer of fiction to boast that i have not allowed the actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings let the local colour be correct by all means but wc make a fetish of realism if such restrictions are put upon what in its essentials is an imaginative art the account of though sham court at delhi says mrs steel  did not need a single touch of fancy in the presentment what a singularly humiliating confession this statement should be if it were true in point of fact as all writers of picturesque history know it cannot be literally true it would only mean that the fancy of one writer was adopted by another and when that other is herself an artist in fiction the result if faithfully pursued would be a literary calamity not so do the great artists use history as scott in ivanhoe or george meredith in vittoria they learn its uses and its limitations the test of the historian is his accuracy but the critic must test mrs steele as a novelist not by her descriptions of the real scenes of the indian mutiny nor by her clever transcriptions of the chronicles but by the human beings and human characters wbich she invents the passions and ideas with which she invests them by the play of her creative talent round the creatures of her imagination as they move through the world which she has chosen as their environment and by her capacity for making an artistic unity out of the variety of circumstances it is in this respect that on the face of the waters is weak the desire to tell the whole history of the siege of delhi has interfered seriously with the human interest in the story up to p 210 there is a definite elot in the relations between major erlton is wife and his mistress but when mrs gissing falls the first of the women victims at delhi mrs steel violently removes the whole moral situation to which she seemed to be working upremoves it just at the climax when mrs erlton learns that another woman is to be a mother by her husband in a scene which till its natural sequel is ruthlessly cut off is full of promise for the working out of a most interesting problem of life alice gissing is certainly the most human of the characters in this story her relations with erlton whose wife is represented at first as bound to him by the nominal tie only are described with rare and even audacious sympathy  and when this chain of circumstance is abruptly snapped there is nothing to take its place the final two hundred pages one half of the book have no real human interest except the historical one mrs steel apparently intended the relations between jim douglas and mrs erlton to supply it but the sympathy of the reader is not aroused their adventures in the town in hiding while the mogul reigns in delhi and the british troops are besieging it from the ridge are most brilliantly narrated but they are the adventures of isolated beings both of them as bloodless as any men or women could be in such a situation and mrs steel evidently felt the mechanical aspect of their union after major erltons death when she relegated it to an appendix this division of the story into two parts one dealing with alice gissing and major erlton and the other with mrs erlton and jim douglasdeprives it of unity which is not adequately attained by the part played by douglas in both portions what unity the volume has is given by its history of the siege of delhi and to say this is to praise mrs steel the historian at the expense of mrs steel the novelist while we maintain that a great novel is not to be composed bv giving an historical background to several brilliantly interwoven episodes it must be admitted that mrs steel does ive us of her best in the way of episode in on the face of the waters all that relates to the natives whether to the sepoys or the court or the town is admirable and the sketches of british military and civil life are absolutely convincing mrs steel sees detail everywhere and records it minutely but she is full of humanity in the broader sense and can give us the mysticism of the oriental as faithfully as the easyoing morality of the angloindian each incident almost each chapter is a picture by itself revealing an extraordinary wealth

its imaginative side it is strong and deeply impressive architecturally it is a wonderbut we did not recognise this very early mrs steels aim was to write a history of the indian mutiny which should at the same time be a work of fiction the fiction to serve the history by lighting it up with living human interest as to her facts she says the reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part which real men took in it is scrupulously exact even in the date the hour the scene the very weather a critic of fiction has most concern with

and tragedy of it the sensations of the natives loyal and disaffected and of the angloindians no one has taken such trouble before save historians and they have left the imagination out of the fineness of the detail it is impossible to speak too highly or of the great mental force that has shaped the mass of facts personalities sensations into a whole but it has the defects of its qualities a reader is sometimes overwhelmed dazed and baffled by the demands on his attention such a book should be given its best chancewhich is the careful consideration of ample leisure it is not a playhour novel but a bit ot hard reading with matter in it to reward the labour and to rouse the keenest admiration for the writers force and her sympathetic imagination  on the face of the waters new novels

mutiny or on the part real men took in it is scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather nor have i allowed the actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings this statement is we believe strictly accurate and the local colouring is singularly exact the tale too is as valuable as it is interesting for it gives an excellent insight into the native side of the indian mutiny and into the characters of some of the leading personages  such as for instance the king and queen of delhi the moulvie and bukht khan on the other hand it brings vividly before us the conduct and bearing of some of the principal fighters on the british side such as nicholson and hodson moreover it most wholesomely revives our recollection of the scandalous behaviour of the majorgeneral commanding at meerut and the want of energy and independence displayed by brigadier archdale wilson the author notwithstanding her general accuracy has perpetrated one or two little mistakes for example she defines krani as lowcaste english whereas it really is the contemptuous term applied to halfcastes again she is historically inaccurate when she writes of the rifle brigade having been engaged at budle  ke  serai it was the 60th rifles who took part in that action the rifle brigade not having been represented in india till several months later viewed simply as a novel the book is well and vigorously written but we regret to find that the author is unable to shake herself free from the objectionable habit prevalent among so many lady writers of dragging in the sexual question freely this blemish renders the work unsuitable for young people,omance_contra

twelfth volume of the new series of the writings of this really popular author affords us another opportunity of dwelling upon the merits of this highly interesting work the title is sufficient of itself to attract particularly as the name of james is added to it the character of old sir andrew halbrooke is drawn with great power his manners are the very impersonation of the true old english gentleman we hear so much about not but that we believe that even in these days there is as much goodness as much virtue and gallantry about as there ever was but the mind is apt whilst contemplating life as it flows onward like a stream to believe that the further from the fountain the more impure so in history we learn from traditions and from romance of the virtues of our ancestors their follies and vices are buried in the dust and we dwell with delight on what pleases us so will it be in future ages the days of victoria will be as much eulogised then as the days of elizabeth are by some people now but we are wandering from the story which it is not how ever our design to tell as many of our readers have no doubt read the book and those who may desire to do so would not perhaps thank us for depriving them of a pleusure which we have enjoyed we cannot however pass over the effective opening of the seventh chapter in which tim meakes is introduced to the reader tim is an old soldier whose story you may take in at a glance and be satisfied at the same time that you cannot mistake your man you find there that character often met with but little appreciated except in novelsthe fine manly english sergeant meukes is the type of a large class who fill our common towns and villages and are unkilown and forgotten by those who are d by the country to look after their welidbre the fine old soldier however is not in the position in which too many of our veterans arehe is tolerably well off and cares but little for the sorrows of this world happy with his gun and dogs he despises the common comforts of man mr james has succeeded admirably in depicting this character we feel an interest in him the moment he is brought upon the stage edith is well drawn but our author scarcely succeeds in delineating female characters so well as his male nevertheless we have little to complain of she possesses many of the qualities that are necessary in a person destined to combat successfully with the world farmer bull is also admirably depicted nnd so is also the elder mr forrest a selfish coldblooded fellow who would sacrifice every thing to satisfy his own craving disposition the peace comfort or happiness of his wife and daughter are matters about which be cannot of course interest himself his objects must be attained at whatever sacrifice of the feelings of others as to the general story we may observe that where it is not highly wrought it is interesting and cannot fail to please the reader the present volume is got up with much taste and judgment the illustration is well executed by hablot browne the size of the work is most convenient while the paper and type are excellent the spirit with which the present series is got up cannot fail toinsure it great success for the admirers of jamess works of fiction will now have an opportunity of making the work n houehold and familiar piece of furniture the purity and morality displayed in every one of

and co 1847 historical novels unless written by those who are very familiar with the subject are generally vapid and uninteresting for whatever pains an author may take to conceal his want of knowledge a careful reader may soon detect it james has however deter mined not to have this fault found with him and has been at the pains to render himself familiar with the manners and customs of the period of which he treats and has carefully studied the history of those days the stirring reign of henry iii affords abundant materials for romances at that time england was just emerging from barbarism and was beginning to feel her own strength and determined to be neither ill governed by a king nor tyrannised over by a set of foreign minions simon de montfort animated by the purest feelings of patriotism saw with grief the distracted state of his country and determined to do his utmost to restore peace and happiness once embarked on the task he sparednopainstobringit toafortunateconclusion he foresaw that the struggle would be bloody but conscious rectitude compelled him to waive every consideration and despite of private feeling to give his life and fortune to the cause of social reform james has judiciously chosen the period wherein to lay his plot just at the time when simon de montfort was in power plots and conspiracies beset him on all sides jealousy and treachery marted his projects ill seconded by those from whom he had been led to expect warm support we can well imagine even before perusing forest days what boundless materials for romance were ready at hand civil war was prepar ing to desolate the land the kings partywere fortifying their castles and mustering their adherents and all appeared dark and lowering at this moment the story begins in those good old times as we are wont to call them when we merely regard them through the vehicle of romance the forests still flourished in their glory and robin hood and his merry men lightly trod the green sward and occasionally enlivened the woods by the sound of the horn or the twang of the bowstring  good old timesit is the fashion to call them so and many unreflenting persons look back with regret on the days that are past when the villages remained undisturbed and the villagers knew nought of what was going on beyond the circle of their visionwhen in fact a general simplicity prevailed and when our countrymen were happier and more contented if they had been so we might sorrow but such was never the case people are as happy and contented now as they ever wereindeed far happier the same passions disturbed them and the same crimes were committed then as nowhuman nature does not change but if our civilisation be worth anything it does and will ameliorate the condition of mankind our railways our steamers our canals our improvements in the arts aud sciences are mere evidences that we are advancing rapidly in the career of human progress and that we are going ahead as fast as practicable comforts and education are great incentives to happiness and few will deny that all classes at present enjoy greater comforts and a better education than they ever previously possessed  forest days  is one of the best of jamess novels it is distinguished by many of those qualities which insure popularity a rapid succession of adventures well combined one part resting upon the other no scenes introduced not bearing directly upon the narrative and characters in which one feels great personal interest among them robin hood bearb a distinguishedtpart this outlaw possesses always a particular fascination and if well treated is sure to invest a story with interest james has succeeded admirably in delineating the monarch of sherwood and the reader will follow his career with great interest most persons however have read the work before us and we have noticed this reprint principally as it is one of the best of jamess novels and also that we might bear testimony to the careful manner in which it is got up the printing is excellent and it forms a very handsome addition to a gentlemans library there are few however who purchase novels when they are first published but these cheap editions will no doubt tempt many to obtain them fourteen volumes have already ap peared and we feel no doubt they have met with great success james is a favourite writer among a very large class and he deserves the popularity he hasacquired for his works ever breathe with a pure and earnest tone there is no word or expression to offend the most modest reader and the purpose is ever good to uphold virtue and expose viceto show how in this world the good are rewarded if not with outward honours with inward peace and that the wicked however they may appear happy and contented and surrounded with blessings are in fact most wretched that beneath the smile that plays around the lips of the invividious a canker is knawing to the very hearts core such has been mr jamess object and he has succeeded parents have no fear in placing these volumes in the hands of their children for however he may gild life with romance we never rise from his pages with a feeling that our respect for virtue has been tampered with or our disgust of vice abated this is a great deal to say of a writer who has written so much but what we say we conscientiously believe and therefore we always feel a pleasure in noticing mr jamess works for however we may be inclined to condemn the plot or dislike the characters we have never to quarrel with the authors

spirit of revenge converted though cripple into a terrible giant who drank of the cup of revenge till the dregs grew bitter in his mouth  how the spirit of kindness made the giant a dwarf and endowed him with a wondrous power of conciliating love aud obedience and how this dwarf engaged in a mission of charity and gentleness and became finally a martyr and more powerful to inculcate his principles

refusing to sanction an unjust war but his death is only the consummate accomplishment of all the divine objects of his life but the people still looked upon huan as one beloved by god and feared to draw the sword unless he blessed the banners they were to fight under so aleph sought out huan in his dungeon and spake kindly to him promising him his liberty if he would but consecrate the banners

idealist j owning a sympathy with all things animate and inanimate and partly by her fathers housekeeper agate bisselin  every respect the counterpart of miss ophelia in  uncle 1 toms cabin the same conscientiousness the same in  dustry and the same untiring energy which marked that i indefatigable lady rose under this training became as  near perfection as is possible for mortals barton finally

frank bose takes the rather doubtful step of refusing him before he proposes heywood is one of the bestdrawn characters in the booka perfect contrast in all things to bartonfair aristocratic with a sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a gentleman wants a decorous faith a good plain sensible worship and then with a good conscience he turns to the enjoyment of life leaving to the deity andexcuse meto the yankees the management of unfathomable mysteries he makes little progress with rose but the arrows aimed for her find their mark in alice cathcart and she learns to love the bright young southerner an accident which happened while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely broken in upon by the news of the bombardment of fort sumter and we have an animated description of the rapidity with which the war summons was answered our friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a representation of american inner life we can thoroughly recommend this work of a man who is in his own person a remarkable representative of the public life of america,omance_contra

naturally leaned over her saying  kate  kate   we read that on this her eyes filled with tears and love and that the pair were  on the brink of temptation but fortunately at that moment george came in and kate like  wellconducted person flew into his arms only for a time however was this to endure george with the prudence that should of right belong te an honest husband resolves on going over to ceylon alone to look after his business and says to cartland if i go harry you will see her constantly and watch her as carefully as if she were your own yon will promise it is needless to say that the sly wretch of a doctor does promise and does watch over kate as carefully as if she were his own so carefully indeed that he ends by making her his own not however in the way in which things would happen in a shocking french novel but by what she takes for lawful marriage after the supposed death of george but here let it be noted that before she fancied grafton to be dead she had  put her arms about cartland her lips on his fevered brow and said several times that she loved him she was careful however to add  when i cease tobe his i am yours love while he lives never theseremarkable scenes took place in cartlands private rooms in london whither kate had accompanied him shortly afterwards he persuaded her that george was dead and the very next day they were married meanwhile the wily cartland had found a dying girl very like kate and when was she dead sent her off in a coffin inscribed with mrs graftons name to mrs graftons house by means of this simple device grafton away in ceylon was persuaded that his wife was dead he took the news of her death however less coolly than she did that of his and was indeed so true toiler memory that although a charming girl was saved with him from a wreck on purpose to fall in love with him he utterly refused to marry her until public opinion decided that unless he did so she could not continue to live in his house which she distinctly declined toquit however they were married and had an infant son and lived very happily until george with his usual idiotcy came straight back to england because his first wifes meddling aunt reported to him with no evidence to back her statement that kate was still alive having ascertained that this was indeed the fact and fathomed the depth of cartlands villany he refused to have anything more to do with the woman he had as he thought married in ceylon because for her to stay with him longer would be a sin his noble soul never conceived the possibility of keeping the matter secret from her about which there would have been no difficulty the fitting climax to this string of hideou rubbish is that kate having gone mad for a time recovers to be affectionately tended by her successor and while the two are talking religious platitudes which are under the circumstances only less offensive than those uttered by cartland on his deathbed george enters george graftonfor it was henever forgot that sight his two wives  it would have been surprising if he had kate immediately dies and george marries the other wife again next day what became of the unfortunate child born before this second and legal marriage we do not hear we should not have been at the pains of noticing such stuff as  the hazelhurst mystery but for its being an attempt to give to a revolting story au aspect of goodiness which is infinitely sickening we may give as an instance of this the deathbed of cartland already referred to when this excessively wicked person wras dying  kate fell upon her knees holding the almost dead hands and breathed that blessed promise into the failing ears of the dying man who had lived an unbeliever  and she saw that he believed at last for a glorious smile of intelligence

geographical discoveries in the near east the politics of thracia and pannonia will be found no serious drawback to a vivid story of incident including a multiplicity of characters and incidents that at first is positively bewildering but the writer has shown before now that she can weave a complicated plot and at the same time maintain a central interest in both respects she has again succeeded though we cannot consider her present performance equal in romantic and picturesque qualities to  the warden of the marches the benevolent schemer whose plots to erect a jewish kingdom in palestine so nearly succeed is a remarkable conception and contrasts strongly with his ultraenglish nephew the downright and goodhearted lord u sk but the fair american who jilts the latter for a throne is really

with care and with a good deal of spirit and however perilous they appear we always now have the conviction that they will not materially alter the comfortableness of the nicely bred english people who survive them the workmanship is invariably good and the personalities are always sufficiently varied these remind us of a clever tourists sketches which never quite miss the rendering of character

and even of detail realizes and more than realizes the imaginations of defoe it is the selftold tale of a young man who with his wife and a little dog was wrecked on a reef of rocks enclosing and protecting two small unoccupied islandsand of his residence there for ten or twelve years mr seaward left england when about twentythree as the supercargo of a vessel bound for the bay of honduras in 1733accompanied by his newmarried wife three or four years younger than himself the vessel was driven by a storm upon the rocksthe crew took to the boat which was swampedand seaward and his wife who adhered to the wreck were the sole survivors the return of the tide lifted the vessel off the rocks and enabled him to get it into a creek and thus secure it against future storms with the stores of the vessel they were in no danger of starving and in a spirit of thankfulness for their preservation they quickly bestirred themselves to provide as far as they could for their personal security and comfort the island was very small but they were the lords of it and had no conflicting interests to contend with iguanas peccaries and armadillos were the only animals they met with the first their little dog killedbut the peccaries made fight and gave them some trouble the shore supplied them with mullets and crabs and turtle abounded the stranded vessel was their home and on the island they sowed and planted and domiciliated the ducks and fowls and goats which they had on board seaward laboured hard with the planks which fortunately had formed part of the cargo at building a house and making enclosures for his fruits and corn and stock fondly attached as were seaward and his bride their lone situation drew the chords of affection the closer and the island in a blissful climate was their paradise it is impossible for the coldest heart to read and not melt at the details of their attachment in the island they found a cavethe retreat of large flocks of pigeonswhere their attention was one day attracted by the appearance of artificial brickwork they removed the bricks and discovered a mass of treasuredoubloonsto the extent of forty or fifty thousand pounds with vessels of gold and silver in great abundance chiefly church plate though apparently all this was of no more value to them than the diamond to ajsops cock they carefully closed up the aperture and after some scruples resolved to appropriate the prizethey might not stay there for ever at the end of about six months a boat with five negroestwo men and three womenrunaway spanish slaveslanded and being kindly welcomed proved themselves faithfully devoted to their service seaward was thus relieved from severe personal labour and had nothing further to do than direct the willing industry of his new friends a few more months rolled away when an american vessel appeared off the rocks pursued by a spanish guardacosta seaward and his negroes assisted in repelling the spaniard and in the american which remained some weeks for repairs he finally took a passage for himself his wife and the treasure to jamaicaleaving behind him the negroes with directions till his return at jamaica he took measures for securely transferring his doubloons c to a london banker with a prudence and caution quite exemplary instead of following his treasures he had resolved to return to the island and purchasing a vessel and fitting it out with a cargo of useful matters and a crew of negroes and labourers and a naval officer to commandfurnishing himself also with a commissionfrom the commandant at jamaicahe soon reached again the new settlement soon some relations from england joined them more negroes were obtained from jamaicahis plans prosperedand he resolved to go to england to visit his friends and make preparations for extending the colony in england he found his money growing at perry and childs the bankers and mrs child introduced the wealthy strangers to her fashionable society for which neither seaward nor his wife had much taste intent upon his purpose seaward lost no time in opening a negotiation with the government for the lurchase of the twio islands of which he had himself taken possession for the crown but met with great and apparently insuperable difficultieschiefly as it turned out from not understanding the ministers particular mode of transacting business lie did not readily comprehend the necessity of contributing to sir roberts bribepurse a curious scene of ministerial tactics is laid open for which we have unluckily no space meanwhile mrs seaward had employed mrs childs marituamaker and shown her some beautiful gold stuff quite unparalleled in england mrs childs mantuamaker happened to be the queens also and the tale of the gold stuffs quickly reached the royal ears a visit from the mistress of the robes lady sundon followed mrs seaward presented the stuffs to the queen and was introduced to the royal presence the adventures of herself and husband became naturally the topic of conversation the queen was delighted with the story and with the simple manners of mrs seaward and all difficulties in the husbands negotiation vanished like lightning his demands were granted and himself knighted to the amazement and vexation of sir robert who could not comprehend the manceuvre the queen was at that time regent 1736 all impediments being thus removed the new knight accelerated the supplies for his colony engaged a surgeon and a chaplain and took under his protection a dozen german families recommended by the queeninvesting before he set out a portion of his money in the purchase of the hartland estate in gloucestershire where he established his sisters c then returning to the colony he prosecuted his purposes with activity and both islands were soon in a populous and thriving condition at home however sir robert walpole had not forgotten him and took ample revenge for the mortifications he had sustained lie employed seaward in troublesome negotiations with the spanish commanders on the spanish main and finally singled him out to apologize in the name of the government for some injuries said to have been committed by british vessels this was a perilous service isle refused to accede to the humiliating demands of the spanish commander was thrown into prison and only rescued by vernons capture of the fort again returning to the settlements he found every thing prospering but soon finding himself involved in more business and conflicts than was agreeablethe same necessity no longer continuing and perhaps he himself wearyinghe finally quitted it for his estate in england a gap here occurs in the ms but a few closing pages have escaped which contain his spirited remonstrance with the government relative to their cession of the two little islands to the spaniards the dialogue with the duke of newcastle is most characteristic of that addleheaded but obstinate personage sir edward was compelled to submit and accept of a very inadequate compensation for himself anl his friends this was in 1749 and  now my dear edward said his beloved eliza at the close of this decisive interview with the duke of newcastle  let us return to hartland and finish our days in peace the excellent lady died a few months after sir edward survived till 1774 the ms was placed by his representative in the hands of miss j porter by whose adviceand nothing could be betterit has been printed the details are occasionally too minute but the story carries with it throughout a deep and a touching interest sufficient to cover more serious faults  sir edward seagers narrative of his skipwreck and consequent discovery of certain islands in the caribbean sea with a detail of many extraordinary and highly interesting events in his life from the year 1733 to 1749 as written in his own diary edited by miss jane porter 3 vols post 8vo we have heard that two men the only inhabitants of the eddystone lighthouse quarrelled and never spoke to each other for months the anecdote is mentioned as the most perfect known instance of sulkiness as they could converse with no others in the book before us we have a specimen which better suits the human character before the fall we have a sort of a mr and also a mrs robinson crusoe in reality though not in name who live like adam and eve in paradise loving and beloved with perfect happiness though only by themselves and we solemnly believe that two amiable people however ennuyes may live together in honeymoon style through having no resources but in themselves it is certain too that persons who have the stores of a whole vessel at command shipwrecked upon a fine uninhabited island in a tropical climate and who are also young and healthy may lead a very patriarchal and agreeable life for such a circumstance attaches to the history of pitcairns island and as necessity is the mother of invention so that son may turn out a very handy bustling and useful fellow such a narrative is now before us and considering it either as a romance or a history it does great credit to miss porter we find in it all the resources of aladdins wonderful lamp  the phraseology however is not in keeping with that of the year 1734 without any supernatural aid it further teaches us that in almost any situation there may be happiness where there is reason and virtue not passion and vice and that civilization under the former circumstance may be of speedy growth the book is also an excellent study for missionaries inasmuch as it teaches them their trade and the uses of their tools as well as inculcates a piety and philanthropy so productive of reason happiness and good conduct as to exhibit in a most attractive view the real blessedness of sound religious principles the work being however composed wholly of practical details we shall not make any extracts only in conclusion observe that it is one of the best books which we ever saw for instruction in the establishment of colonies and one that with particular singularity shows how pleasantly adam and eve may have lived in paradise at least till a doctor was wantedbut where there are children old people accidents and epidemics physic is an indispensable necessity nevertheless animals do without doctors but they are instinctively good herbalists and have their own pharmacopoeia,omance_contra
B2148,['8530668'],  molly bawn lcty bavrn by thc author of  phyllis london smith and elder we must commence by drawing a distinction between a coquette and a flirt lest such praises as we are inclined to bestow upon the heroine of this book should bc misunderstood and interpreted as approval of the general practises of flirtation a coquet ti1 likes admiration anel so does a flirt and both of them are induced to go out of their way to seek it but the coquette seeks admiration and strives to make herself attractive rather for the sake of flattering her own vanity and of being a focus of attraction to the other sex the flirts ulterior aim is to win love which she does not reciprocate it is for this that she courts admiration when she has won the love at which she has been aiming she is content to throw it away and to seek a new conquest the coquette need not have any arrure pewee of winning real affection homage not love is what she craves if she finds that she has unwittingly won the latter she is apt to draw in her horns and tobe dismayed at the results of her folly she likes attentions but not intentions and admiration without affection the two terms are often used synonymously yet if a difle renee does exist it is such as we have stated the flirt is heartless and selfish thc coquette impulsive anel vain but nothing worse having thus defined we may premise that molly bawn is a thorough lil le coquette her coquetry may almost bc called artless yet coquetry it undoubtedly is she is pretty aud she is aware of the fact what young lady is so gifted anel withal unconsious of her endowmentr her temperament is foreshadowed in the opening chapter where she and her halibrother and sisterinlaw are awaiting the arrival of the guest who is to be mollys fate hereafter tired of waiting for this late arrival molly stares at herself in a glass and laments that she has  taken such pains with her hair and attire generally then she says to her brother  john since t hero is no one else to admire nie do say whether you think it or net i am the prettiest person you ever saw molly strikes up a warm friendship with the newcomer luttrell within a few hours of his arrival she at once confesses herself overjoyed at his arrival but the reason she assigns is characteristic of herif you only knew as well as 1 do the terrible neverending dullness of this place you would undtstand how one could long for the coming of any tii like congreves fair amoret molly is coquette aad cy at once she likes to be admired and to receive att nt lons  she might doubtless would lee styled forward by ni 1 ni ii ls and straitlaced people but she is coy of winning love and even at tie idea of awakening it yet she recounts t  luttrell with narre candour the diverse proposals which she even at nineteen has already received from the successive imiits of the parish and other admirers luttrell is soon hopehvsly in love yet it is some time before molly reciprocates his affections but a temporary tiff between them brings malters to a climax and he proposes she accepts him ritt somo momentary hesitation but shows thc real ntate of ber feelings when she says to bc made love to always every day would hill me ncverthc less they are engaged and before luttrell leaves moll receives an invitation to visit her grandfather a wealthy landed proprietor wdiom old age ill health and illtemper combined have made a misanthropical tyrant mollys mother committed a mesalliance as an amherst in old mr amhersts eyes when she became the second wife of mr massercene an irish gentleman of small means and though she was his favourite daughter he foreswore all further communication with her till now he has ignored molly and two other grandchildren marcia amherst and philip shadwell stand highest in his good graces waiting eagerly to stand in his shoes when he shall pass over to the majority these two have engaged themselves to each other the old man realises the motives of their devotion to him and his goodwill is not increased by the discovery of a halffinished letter from marcia to her mother lamenting her grandfathers tenacity of life nor by learning that shadwell is speculating upon his expectations by means of post obits molly soon carries all before her at herst royal where luttrell soon joins the party her coquetry conquers shadwell and also one plantagenet potts whose name and characteristics of ugliness and gooel nature are hardly original we fear molly is however pained when she finds that she has wron philip shadwells love and strives to keep him at a distance luttrell is naturally jealous and wc are afraid to say how many lovers quarrels are recorded between them thrice at least in thc course of the book is their engagement broken off only to be speedily renewed with increased warmth when molly coaxingly rubs her cheek against lu trolls sleeve like a spaniel courting a caress the citadel surrenders unconditionally we can hardly say that we should like a sister or daughter of ours to play the hoyden as does molly lest wrorse should befall them  and yet we must confess that there is a charin in the wayward and coquettish heroine which makes us condone as soon as we have censured when her love has once been really kindled she is devoted to luttrell though the latters expectations are meagre while philip shadwell her cousin is heir presumptive to the twenty thousand a year of herst royal so soon as his grandfather shall be good enough to take his departure we cannot say that molly is an unnatural character we have actually known girls more or less like her whose coquetry was only skin deep and whose affection was wann trusting sincere and honest it is part of the licence of an author to combine this amount of eccentricity of character with faultlessness of face and figure and with a voice that entrances all who hear her sing admitting that a molly bawn is a possible though a very rare occurrence in life we may then say that the story has a natural and unaffected tone throughout and that thc reality of the conversations and predicaments and thc absemcc of artificiality in thc other characters which compose the setting to this jewel are quite refreshing after thc amount of trashy novels which it has been our fate to wade through of late if the tone of the conversations were less natural and thc pictures less artistically drawn molly might at once appear a flirt whose good points were inconsistent with her predilections there is no striking incident throughout thc book  the interest depends upon the vivacity of the narration to which we give all credit thc several walking gentlemen and ladies play their parts well and keep the piece going admirably there is a good comedy of errors wherein a sir penthony stafford has to woo and win his own wife whom he has married without previous acquaintance and under a special agreement that so soon as the ceremony was over they should separate for ever a curious will of an uncle which made their marriage the sole condition of succeeding to his estate is thc reason assigned for this eccentric arrangement but wc must parenthetically state that legally the conditions would have been inoperative in the absence of specific trusts of which the author makes no mention this sort of will is a favourite though impossible resource of novelists how molly breaks her silken fetters with luttrell only to rivet them anew how her brother dies suddenly and leaves her and his family destitute how she disdain her grandfathers offer that she shall live with him al his heiress and leave her sisterinlaw to starve how 6he becomes a star upon the stage of the concertroom in order to support his brothers wielow and family  how in the end she find herself mistress of herst royal anel the inevitable sequel results we recommend our readers to study for themselves the book though it portrays coquetry is singularly free from the least soupcon of coarseness and would not corrupt a girl in her teens which is a good deal to be able to say of any modern novel which at the same time has though faculty of being clever and amusing,omance_contra

fire in some culinary preparation she started wvith surprise as her unexpected guests entered the apartment and stood a morment surveying them attentively anad with an air of gentleness and pity rather than of curiosity miriam on her part regarded the indian female with involuntary admiration she had scarcely passed the season of youth and her mature and noble figure at once dignified and graceful possessed that vigour and elasticity so peculiar to the natives of the forest while her regular features her soft and intelligent countenance expressed a mind susceptible of elevated sentiments and a heart warmed by the gentlest affections of her sex cushnminaw cautiously drew a mat over the aperture through which they entered and advancing close to his adopted mother with very

unexpected favour miriam attempted to reply but her spirits were weakened by fatigue and misery and for the first time during that anxious day of captivity her tears flowed abundantly and prevented her utterance aliomna seemed grieved by her distressi  she spread a soft new mat gently urged her to sit down and wthen she began to smile through her tears expressed her delight by patting her cheeks and stroking the hair from her forehead and appeared greatly to admire her beauty  cusliminaw soon after left the wigrwamn and mxioma perceiving her captives were faint for want of nourishment

swalliow a few kernels of corn to satisfy the calls of nature mlionia in the mean time busied herself in arranging an apartment for her guests for though a wigrwam seldom contained mere than one room

endeavoured to encourage them with the hopes of release and to assure them they were in no iminediate danger several days passed away without any important occurrence mlononotto spent most of his time

of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may

and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in

peculiar words  clhtchedrine  is an unpronounceable version of the name of the satirist shchedrin a few notes would have been helpful an english reader cannot be expected to know who is a  milkite or

repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i

B8982,['8907271'],  literature the writings of john greenleaf whittier 7 vols macmillan  co this edition of the works of mr whittier is intended at least as to the poems to be complete unless so far as there are hopes that the time  honoured author whose  brown dwarf of eugen  and  one of the signers date only from last year may add some postscripts of pleasant verse to the collection which now contains he says  all that i care to republish and some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself i should have omitted at the request of his publishers mr whittier has in this edition allowed the reappearance though only in an appendix of early poems which for many years he has banished as not worthy of his nameand as to which indeed it is not possible to say that his name will restore them to the favour with which they were received by american readers of sixty years ago when as he apologetically remarks  the standard of criticism was not discouragingly high the publishers object in persuading mr whittier to republish the things that he would rather not have written was  to make the edition so complete and retrospective that students of the poets career will always find the most abundant materials for their purpose and if we are to suppose that mr whittiers readers read not for the sake of his poetry but to give themselves a course of educational study on his career as a poet the appendix may certainly be useful to them tor the excess of juvenile efflorescence and the protraction of its period in mr whittiers case as contrasted with the fact of his nevertheless coming to a fruitage time are shown by the poems in this appendix and their dates to be exceptional and though the phenomenon is easily explainable by the cause mr whittier assigns for the popularity of his verse in its turgid immaturity it offers something for the student of the career to study if he will take the trouble to compare with mr whittiers literary infancy the literary infancies of other writers who earlier or as late as he like him eventually arrived at literary years of discretion but even from this point of view it is difficult to see any sufficient advantage gained to the world by overruling mr whittiers wisely critical judgement of his least meritorious productions the arrangement has however given him the opportunity of dismissing the tedious and unreal attempt in the school of scott  mogg megone which disfigured his former collected editions to the limbo of the appendix and thus increasing the honour to which his riper work entitles him from all critics who appreciate artistic unaffectedness and the grace of sobriety the poems of mr whittiers literary prime vary much in quality but all have at least the strength of manly common sense good taste and direct expression while many possess also either reticent and therefore effective pathos or a certain eager and orderly rush rather perhaps of orator than of poet but instinct with metrical vigour which has characterised some of his most popular pieces his boundaries have not been wide but within them he has been master he has been sure of his purpose and what he purposed he could effect and he has shown an understanding of his limits which is in itself a faculty of no mean order in england his poetry taking it all in all has not met with the wide and somewhat undiscriminating acceptance it has received from his own countrymen and only a few pieces can be named as having become favourites of our general public but we may fairly say that the restriction of the welcome on this side the water is quite as undiscriminating as its liberality on the other side for instance now that every one knows  maud muller why are there comparatively few who are familiar with  telling the bees  an idyl so tenderly and touchingly simple that we mean presently to quote it in fullwith  st martins summer with  mabel martin with  the new wife and the old  the suitability of  barbara frietchie and  skipper iresons bide for the semihistrionic recitations now in vogue has made them indeed but too much with us  for it is a dull thing to tire and as we now say to jade any thing too far  but why does no one try  the pinetree or the wreck of rivermouth   the pinetree one of the  antislavery poems is an outburst of wrath on hearing that the antislavery resolves of stephen c phillips had been rejected by the whig convention infaneuil hall in 1846 lift again the stately emblem on the bay states rusted shield give to northern winds the pinetree on our banners tattered field

pilgrim pulse no longer  sits she dumb in her despair  has she none to break the silence 1 has she none to do and dare  o my god  for one right worthy to lift up her rusted shield and to plant again the pinetree in her banners tattered field  this is a fine piece of passionate rhetoric and has real fire in it still mr whittiers antislavery poems do not show him at his best as a poet indeed nobodys antislavery poems ever have been truly poems though some rare few have like  the pine  tree been very good metrical speeches the theme would seem on first thoughts just what must have made any man whose heart was hot about it and who could put feelings into verse at all capable of true poetry for that if for nothing else and must have inspired any true poet with dramatic force and lyric passion to make his least words on it immortal but second thoughts explain why the fact has been so much the reverse antislavery was not a theme for a poet it was too abstract too political and above all too argumentative a great poet might with one short drama one lyric one stanza nay one line about some slave who never existed but in his mind and his readers minds have found his way to human hearts then and for all hereafter as long as the english language lasts but there were in the antislavery agitation no poets who could or would write their poems on the slaves side so the antislavery poets were absorbed in the great public question with all its disputatious details they were in the thick of debates and arguments they wrote them with thought of their opponentsto answer to persuade or to attack poems so written may have their influence in a great public controversy but the controversy over their life is gone they are like weapons of an ancient warfareweapons we respect in the museums but that have no purpose in them for our days mrs beecher stowe in her own line of art managed better she used sympathies of human nature that belonged to all times and peoples and produced a novel which was genuinely a novel with the novels power to absorb attention to amuse and to move and which whatever its faults has lost nothing of that power by reason of the slavery question having become obsolete to her the theme does seem to have given inspiration beyond her normal faculty so that this one book of hers her worst as to some glaring bad qualities has in it a something amounting to genius which her other works can by no means parallel her imagination seems to have been aroused by her zeal while the zeal of the poets whirled their imaginations away and left it the only difference between their polemical productions and those of other able rhetoricians that theirs were in verse and had more similes in them much the same has always been the case with poets polemics weean call to mind no verse directly dealing with aay question agitating the public mind catting for any wrong to be righted urging any great measure which has had it in it to aurvive as poetry the success of its cause except mrs brownings  song of the children and that the  song of the children though intended polemically not only had aa influence on the public mind at the time bat stands forth a poem is because mrs browning with the high poets sympathetic instinct went at once forth from herself aad let her pleadings and her reasonings pass into the piteous simplicity of the thoughts and words of the childrenjust as she would have done in fact had their miseries belonged to ancient history or to an imaginary world to take mr whittier at his best as distinctively a poet we must go to his  poems of nature poems subjective and reminiscent and  narrative and legendary poems as is inevitable when a writer tries to classify his collected poems the series overlap and a piece that stands in one series might as fitly or more fitly stand in another  and it is the merit of the beet poems in these three series that they might all lay claim from one point of view or another to belong to the poems of nature  telling the bees  in the  narrative and legendary poems owes its charm to this and its tender implication and tu4 narration of the simple love and simple sorrow here is the place  right over the hill buna the path i took  vou can see the gap in the old wall still and the steppingstones in the shallow brook there is the house with the gate redbarred and the poplars tall and

occasional series  which with the appendix fill the fourth poetical volume is a set of poems which has only been got into group and made  occasional  by means of a prologue and some tags of conversation at the end of the pieces describing them as having been read aloud by the poet to his companions ina tent on the beach  the collective name of the setthe companions being we are told  fields thelettered magnate and taylor the free cosmopolite declining to accept these oems the wreck of rivermouth the taids of attitash  kallundborg church  the worship of nature and suchas personal and occasional we confine our remarks to the pieces that rightfully belong to these headings when we say that this kind of verse is not so favourably appreciated in england as it appears to be iu the united states possibly all our poets too in their private life write verse to each other but if so they except in one or two exceptional instances do not publish it and they are not often called on for odes and hymns at  celebrations  and openings and anniversariesand so much the better the critic always feels regret when he finds the abilities of men with real gifts frittered away upon these politenesses of the prose there is no need to say much it does not compel blame it does not invite praise margaret smiths journal the editor tells his readers presents a tolerably lifelike picture of the past  unfortunately it does not the shorter tales also show that mr whittier has not that gift of vividness of making even transparent unreality seem true till the moment the reader leaves off reading which is specially the novelists the papers in the two other volumes are on  the conflict with slavery on politics and reforms on literary and historic subjects or are brief biographies of men and of books and tributes to contemporariesall of them manifestly contributions to periodical literature they have of course spirit and purpose we marked from one paper only at least a dozen passages quite amazing for inflation mixed metaphor and bad taste passing to another paper we found not one florid sentence the prose works are not dated but the difference in style must be a matter of dates and it may be reasonably inferred that the florid papers belong to the immature period and the better ones be taken as the true standard of mr whittiers prose,omance_contra

the poor old woman very considerably in my esteem cecilia by having this two hundred a year in addition to the ten thousand pounds settled on each of my mothers younger children by her marriage settlement may be considered aa in some degree repaid for the tremendous sacrifice of having been brought up by mrs watts instead of in the bosom of the laurrington family and i trust that it may

superior church or as mrs trollope has it the church of the riff ht sort a friend of one of the characters writes it from oxforda nice young man of the new faith deep divinitytalking early n the morning churchgoing profound thinking cheerful chatty theologian we congratulate the grave pusey and selfdenying newman on mrs trollopes ladyabbess advocacy here are her views of oxford persecution and the sermon   and talking of that sir edward i can tell you that i have been thinking and so have a lot more of graceless young fellows like myselfi have been thinking and it would be rather difficult to help doing so just now i do believe upon the great and truly wonderful effect of persecution would you believe it sir edward since that extraordinary business the other day at oxford i could count over to you at the very least a dozen and a half of young men of my own particular acquaintance and not one of them a much deeper thinker coz than myself who have not only read the sermon and have felt it too most of them i can tell you to their very fingers ends but have never missed an opportunity since of going to church and always as you will easily believe to the riht sort  and moreover have profited in a i manner that i truly believe nothing else could have enabled them to do by what they have heard there of course you have read it and i should like to know your opinion as to whether there exists in the history of the church any instance of a similar transaction it does seem so new to hear all the young men let their profession be what it will discoursing upon theology but i have heard one of our officers say that this business will do as much good as father mathew and that the sermon will produce as great an effect as the pledge even the young ladies i promise you are not like the same creatures on some points that they used to be as to letting people joke i mean about sacred things  and they do say that there is nothing now which procures so good a reception from many of the most celebrated beauties as letting them know that you are in the habit of going to early church of a morning all this is very remarkable isnt it  i really trust it will do good in all ways and besides i cant help liking it as showing something in favour of goor abused human nature depend upon it sir edward it was the injustice ofthe sentence in the first instance that stirred up mens hearts and womens too upon the subject and if it be for good as most people seem to believe the victim will bc thc first to bless and kiss the rod wc may be very sure of that the mastermanns are well drawn especially frank in the later scenes lady willbury is not so good and in the tendency to caricature the truth is often lost altogether but there is truth in the laurringtons and

matter is less characteristic in more than one outstanding lady novelist wo have noted the determined adoption of passing mannerisms and ephemeral catchwords with the frequent result of loss of originality of outlook and expression the author of faustina had once on a time a sufficient grasp of the nature and habits of average girlhood and her way of presenting her observations was her own

goes without saying miss broughton understood the young peirson of her epoch and wrote of and for herwrote of her language manners aspirations with discrimination and daring she established a convention and handled it with ability and abundant conviction her nancys sarahs and other old heroines had some piquancy and fascination and wanted not a kind of humanity of the later growths of her

tales of these mnlimi  shows him striking what for him is rather an uncommon veln for the story contains a portrait of a little girl it is done with consummate delicacy and is none the worse for

towns by arnold bennett chatto and windus 6s mr bennett has given us in this story something very different from his grand babylon hotel in that  fantasia as he rightly called it we singled out for praise those parts in which character was sketched here character is not merely sketched but portrayed and that throughout while instead of a farcicalmelodramatic setting in the strand we have the grey actualities of the staffordshire potteries the five townshere called turnhill bursley handbridge knype and longshaw are the instantly recognisable centres of the pottery manufacture pottery and wesleyanism constitute the atmosphere the outstanding merit of the story is its intimate and not unpoetic understanding of thc life of the five towns in a drama set under a smokepall filled with portraiture of petty chapel life and dominated by the harsh and miserly character of ephraim tellwright it might be supposed that as a setoff the course of love would be allowed to run with smoothness or at least with ultimate certainty but this is not the case henry mynors the most superior man in the town who can do everything well from arranging and modernising his works to organising a revival is without the power to stir the deep waters of anna tellwrights heart he can command her boundless admiration and waken the hunger or illusion of love but that is all the holier privilege is reservedunfortunately it is reserved rather too longfor willie price the sheepish simple lad who develops a new manliness when his hypocritical father hangs himself for debt in his own sliphouse it is the sudden postulation of futile love between these two at the very end of the story that to our mind is responsible for the readers dissatisfaction with the completed drama for our part we think that anna did really feel for willie price the satisfying love which she perceived only when she was bidding him farewell to australia all her feeling toward the perfect mynors was weak compared with that which flowed unbidden into her words  yes i shall always remember youalways she had saved this lad from disaster by the boldest act of her life an act of opposition to her tyrannous father and she felt for him something of a mothers lovea characterisation finely perceived by mr bennett a womans real love for a man las always in it a touch of the mother for her heart vibrates on a whole  as their eyes met in an intense and painful gaze to her at least it was revealed that they were lovers what to do with them on the last page but one  mr bennetts solution does not satisfy us we do not think that anna would have done what she did or that willie price would have done what he did at any rate neither act seems proved and we are led to wish that this complication had been introduced earlier in the story had been of its stuff instead of its selvage but as a whole the story is a strikingly vivid presentment ol life and character in the potteries  as such it is memorable for its courage and intimacy  fiotion the matador of the five towns by arnold bennett methuen  co this is a collection of twentytwo short storiescontributions to periodical papers of which five are designated  tragic and the rest  frolic by far the best is the one which gives its title to the book  in fact we question whether mr arnold bennett has ever written forty pages more compact of life and imagination than these the diction runs easily and without affectation yet it is strong and serried free from superfluous words the amount of detail included is astonishing but the general effect is kept broad and simple the  matador a certain jos myatt  is the finest fullback in the league   and as the central scene of the tale we have a football match viewed from the grand stand with the players looking like red and white dolls and the vast multitude of spectators itself constituting the chief actor  tragic though the tale is called the humour interwoven with it the unobtrusiveness of the concentration give it rather the character of  pathetic in  mimi there is a charming child who stands apart among mr arnold bennetts children in being shown simply as she is neither as conforming to the carefully calculated exigencies of heredity nor as painfully foreshadowing her own later development into the commonplace or the surprising of the frolic tales  jackataventure under the clock and hot potatoes seem to us the merriest the most skilfully told and the most worth telling we find two or perhaps three more which are well enough the rest are clumsy farfetched and jejune and if they offer us here and there a good epigram a vivid or a grotesque bit of intuition there is plenty of mr arnold bennetts work in which such excellences as these may be enjoyed without the expense of ennui  tales of the five towns by arnold bennett chatto  windus 6s this collection of tales by no means does mr arnold bennett justice once again he takes us to the staffordshire pottery district with its hard commercialism and lack of beauty but his  tales of the five towns  have all the faults and very little of the merit to be found in  anna of the five towns  and leonora instead of a finished picture we are asked to accept mere snapshots as it weresome almost startling in their vagueness and limitation others badly developed and finished off they are more like the photographic attempts of an amateur than of such an experienced and clever worker as mr bennett the author does not show to advantage in the short story his methods are too leisurely too much dependent on detail sometimes in these stories he gives us much detail and very little story as in  the elixir of youth dramatic though the ending of that episode be while in his worship the goosedriver  we miss the light illuminating touches which the author can so well supply in short mr bennett has not the feeling for the short story he seems to have no sense of its delicate and nicely balanced proportionsfew writers have a perusal of the first halfdozen or so leaves the reader with an irritating feeling of emptiness and no desire to progress deeper into the volume is it possible that mr bennett has written these too hastily  a trifle that passes well enough in a magazine will seldom bear reprinting and the author is ill advised to permit it yet one of the qualifications for writing good short stories mr bennett does possessa light bright style and an amusingly sarcastic turn of thought a paragraph here and there is mr bennett at his best but one expects more in a book from him than a few good paragraphs  the matador of the five towns and other stories by arnold bennett methuen and co 6s in this volume mr arnold bennett has collected twentythree of his short stories the first of which giving title to the book is the best the  matador  is a footballer the idol of the populace and rarely have we seen the mental status of the crowd at a footballmatch so mercilessly analysed as in three or four of these pages when a goal is scored the host of the fifteen thousand might just have had their fives saved or their children snatched from destruction and their wives from dishonour they might have been preserved from bankruptcy starvation prison torture they might have been rewarding with their impassioned worship a band of national heroes jos myatt the hero is followed to his home at  the foaming quart where his wife lies ill he has a sordid bet with one of his friends that it will be a boychild and pitiably small we are shown him snarling in the bar over the payment of the money while his wife is dying upstairs it is a powerful little story of a terrible underworld hardly human most of the tales here brought together however are pure comedy and of them all we like best  the cat and cupid the authors methods in the short story correspond precisely with his methods in the novel we feel as we read that he is trying to suppress the profusion of detail in the picture he see but that for a page or two it simply must be set down and in this abbreviated form there is no risk of weariness to the readerthe setting is carefully made and mr bennett proceeds to insert the gem exceedingly humorous are many of the situations in which these five towns worthies are placed and the reader who does not chuckle vastly over the whimsicalities of  the longlost uncle or  the tiger and the baby will be quite unworthy of such a feast without competing with mr wells or other acknowledged masters of the art mr bennett succeeds perfectly in his depiction of an incident

epiite sufficient to elevate her book out of thc class of works of mere amusement into that far higher one of useful teaching the excursions of the imagination when they make no further pretensions may elevate the fancy or in other forms refine the feelings pictures of life may teach us to know the world better  portraits of men may make us more intimately acquainted with the various characters of our fellow beings all these have their respective merits but the endeavour to make all these subservient to the higher aim of enforcing a pure morality and teaching a sterling and useful lesson through a pleasurable medium deserves a higher commendation anel this has been mrs gores strenuous endeavour in  the bankers wife commencing with a minor point we must object to the title the bankers wife is not the leading personage of the history unless on the supposition that she suffers most and that quiescently assuredly the saddest shape of endurance  but even this species of preeminence we are obliged to repudiate because though anguish may be deeply engraven on the surface of the heart it is only remorse that eats into its core the banker is the real hero of the tale and is depicted both with spirit and accuracy position in life is the one thing for which men universally strive to struggle up but never to slide downwards is the great object of the world a little higher and yet a little higher is the still stimulating never satisfied desire of the heart without this craving after an everreceding good which is the bane of peace and the poison of present enjoyment man might and would most generally bc satisfied with his lot since it is not so much on existing evil as on desired good that he founds his dissatisfaction  it is in the desire for happiness which is the shadow that he disregards contentment which is the substance thus the banker makes aggrandisement his aim to keep his position in society nay to elevate himself above it be spends his days in toil his nights in care with the means of ample comfort in his power he rejects its enjoyment for the sake of gaining another step higher in thc work with a wife whom mrs gore has with poetical license made quite perfect and children in whom affection might fairly concentrate and centre his feelings are all poisoned at their spring and turned out of their natural channel it is a sad and dark concomitant of almost every species of crime that it is attended by that other of all the basesthypocrisy but few of the sins of thc world walk avowedly unveiled vice still pays that homage to virtue as but seldom tei show an unabashed unblushing front and hence the intimate connexion of the large family of evil to avoid detection commission follows on commission one sin treads on the heels of another to screen it from observance thus the banker influenced solely nt first by the desire to support the position in life which his deceased parent had occupied gradually gives up every hold on rectitude after exhausting his own resources he trenches on the bankinghouse funds and so there follows a long line of actions of increasing turpitude and the lost man struggling to protract his own utter ruin sometimes trembling at the shadow of a straw sometimes blind to overhanging mountains threatening to fall upon and crush him  labouring like a slave at the galleys oar yet strenuously supporting an aspect of ease devoured with the vulture at his heart yet dressing his lip with miiiles at last becomes that saddest of all things his own victim but the character of the banker is admirably contrasted and the moral of the tale powerfully enhanced by the old hast indian nabob a man who saving and excepting his wealth which he is generous enough not to value for its own sake has been bereft of everything near and dear to a heart abounding in love and home affections a wife on whom he doted with that oldfashioned sort of intensity which has become so outree in modern days and sons grown up to an honourable manhood had all been snatched away wearied with the scenes amid which he had amassed his stores of rupees the old nabob had sought his native land to find himself forgotten by the friends ol his younger days and with all the work of the heart if we may be allowed the expression to begin afresh but the impulses of that heart or rather the fullness of its riches outbursting their overnan ow garnerhouse soon surround the aged and bereaved man with a very atmosphere of love making the happiness of others by a nevertiring generosity he receives the gladness back again reflected into his own bosom while thc banker with every social relationship of life gathered around him is yet as joyless as if he were alone in the vast world true it is that the innate nature and not the outward circumstances makes the reality of a mans true condition the moral worked out by the actions of these two opposite characters is theprimary object of the tale and with this purpose

B9082,['9410645'],  dreamers of the ghetto by i zangwill heinemann mk zangwill is always at his best when he reveals the jews by his patient and sympathetic insight into their ways and by his fearless exposures not only of their greatness but of the more offensive sides of judaism he makes judaismthe judaism which seems to be slowly dying out as the narrow exclusive sect it was intelligible in all its majestic immovability in all its squalid and odious intolerance perhaps no one has ever rendered it so intelligible before sympathetic writers have insisted on the stubbornness of purpose the race and family pride the glorious selfsacrifice for what they hold true which have characterised the jews and their faults have found censorious critics but no one has like mr zangwill fearlessly shown the pathos and the greatness of their squalor and their bigotry and found the secret of their strength even in what renders them most unpopular in christendom ceremony as one of mr zangwills characters here says has been the chief element of their strength another less obvious one which he picks out is the enforced seclusion of the ghetto system which has really only been thoroughly broken down in the present century the bad laws which fastened on them distinctive badges and herded them together in narrow quarters where they saw none but their own coreligionists the insults and persecutions which seemed only to draw them tighter together have all added the strength of martyrdom to their bonds of connexion the removal of these restrictions has already done something to impair the vital unity of the race but not much yet and it remains to be seen if the scepticism and desertions of judaism which are more noticeable now are really anything more than superficial scratches on the system a point which mr zangwill does not notice but which stands out most prominently in his book is the parasitical nature of judaism in the sketch called chad gadya a young venetian jew comes back to venice and makes reflections on the stability of judaism when all the energy and the glory of life which once made venice the great state of the south have departed and he muses on the seeming eternity of judaism when he finds his father living in the palace of some once proud doge or senator that is of course true but he forgets the other point of view that while the proud old venetians gave up all their energy and their wealth to the glorifying of their state the jews a race apart have cared for no country hve made no country great they have flocked where riches were to be found and they have steadily silently selfishly gone on making their private wealth anally to enjoy the half  faded glories in which they had no part the persecutions of the jews are inexcusable but they are explicable from the feeling that all nations have had that they are a race apart who have not the stake in the country which comes from selfsacrifice for it this book is almost entirely concerned with the rebels against ceremony in the jewish foldjews who have been dreamers and have found their souls frozen with the mean ingless jargon and the empty forms which were supposed to make up so much of their livesmen who have tried to burst the bonds but in nearly every case have found themselves either driven back or striving to return to the religion which has guarded them through so many centuries mr zangwill deals with very varied typeswith gay laughterloving heine with the profound philosopher spinoza with the meteor ferdinand lassalle with moses mendelssohn and with sabbatai zevi a messiah who finally turned mohammedan and doorkeeper to the sultan these sketches are not novels they are hardly stories they are as a rule imaginary conversations or isolated incidents in the lives of different people in which their characters stand out translucently a reviewer of mr zangwill said once that he had no human sympathy that his characters do not live there is perhaps a grain of truth in the remark but what would be truer would be to say that all his human sympathy seems merged in judaism as a system he loves it so intensely that though he sees its faults and shows them up he looks on them more as a parent looks on the faults of a favourite child than as a stern critic as he himself justly says in his preface the book is to be looked on as a whole the subject being the old orthodox judaism which all these dreamers play around like flies on a lion as for the sketches themselves the best undoubtedly is that of lassalle the author brings out in a masterly way the stupendous conceit the oriental exuberance of fancy and the marvellous rapidity of execution of this wonderful jew he reminds us much of the glorious and extravagant heroes of disraelis novels or again of harry richmonds father in mr merediths novel heine is good but mr zangwill has fallen into the error which it is difficult to avoid in writing an imaginary conversation of such a wellknown figure he brings in too many allusions to heines own works and employs too many quotations from heine himself consequently the result seems almost too learned to be convincing however it is charming perhaps because there is so much in it of heine himself,omance_contra

of their countrymen that high principle and great talents will under favourable circumstances always command we will even go so far as to say that they have attained to that goodliness of reputation that scurrilous attacks upon them for their spirited yet urbane advocacy of all that tends to promote religious and civil liberty are no longer necessary to make that fame durable that is already so general mary howitt has placed another testimony upon record in the volumes before us that she is fully deserving of her share ot the family honours till they are read few can comprehend how much purity of spirit can be combined with much fervour of imagination i h these volumes we will essay to give the reader a faint idea we believe that the groundwork of it is not fiction it is so domestic so beautiful in its homeliness that invention it ought not to be a family her own goes down to take possession of an inheritance near sunbury and the stories connected or supposed to be connected with the neighbourhood form the staple of the novel for such after all it must be called  for the events throughout arc linked together so as to form what our neighbours the french call a totalitc about one quarter of the first volume is occupied with a description of the surrounding families and the idiosyncracies of their various inmates all this is beautiful writing and for the most part calculated to make us love more ardently our species it also is full of local scenery  indeed through all the volumes there is a superabounding of the pastoral we love the country with ardour an ardour perhaps the more intense that rural pleasures are dealt out to us so sparingly and we love also the writings which describe them but we speak with hesitation it is a matter of mere taste and our taste may be faulty but we think that mary howitt has been rural almost to tediousness take any three or four pages of her continuous descriptions of scenery and we shall find them exquisite  but she still describes and thenand thenwe say it unwillinglywe grow a little weary the descriptions seemed to us in the midst of our admiration like the rapid views we gain of a fine country through the windows of a postchaise travelling quickly  another and another and anotherwe felt overpowered by a succession of beauties the first story of any length incidental to wood leighton is  the sinners grave certainly the most pathetic that we ever read this is the mere fact we found it distressingly so we think that it would have been as a whole much better had it not been so very agonizing the authoress seems to have tried how severely she could wring the heart we do not like uv be thus fooled into tears and to have recourse to twenty little stratagems to conceal the violence of our emotions from whomever may be near us when we read wc know all this will be its best recommendation to the generality of readers your regular devourer of fiction like your inveterate snufftaker requires after a time strong stimulants however this will satisfy them the moral of this tale is excellent and enforced with the strong gentleness of a woman and the authority of an apostle after this strong excitement in order to be quietly let down from our altitudes we haye some excellent gossip about rambles and wayfarers and beggars all in a smooth gossiping gentlewomanly way after we have thus subsided into a dreamy and pleasant quietude we are introduced to the arena in which we find the heirs expectant here mary howitt again becomes great in her strength and vigorously couches her lance against pride in all its hateful ay and in all its graceful disguises too this is a noble talethe pride of power for powers sake which is tyrannythe pride of circumstance anel situation which is follythe pride of stratagem and circumvention which is wickednessand the pride of possessing masses of unused wealth which is avariceare all in their turns exposed aud castigated flus is the holding up of the mirror to mens vices we are strongly inclined to give an outline of this eventful story and of some of the terrible scenes that it involves  hut as to many readers the gradually unwinding of the skein of the narrative aud thus feeding their curiosity discreetly is one of their greatest pleasures we will not rudely tear oh the veil but allow every one to withdraw it from the picture as slowly and as gradually as he chooses lu all sincerity we tell our frieuels that works like this which we are noticing will tend to place the novel in the highest class of writing and make it almost the only vehicle for the inculcation of domestic morality and the rectitude of private life they have already driven the essay from the field of literature we are not sorry for it it is epiite as pleasant to be won as to be coerced to wisdom aud in this light we consider our gifted authoress as au ethical instructress we will dilate no longer on the merits of  wood leighton did we express what we thought of them those who have not read the work might think us guilty of exaggeration whilst those who have might with more justice accuse us either with incapacity sufficiently to commend it or

B4184,"['8664794', '4969372']",  tales of a traveller a literary notices by geoffrey crayon gent on the appearance of bracebridge hall we were led intoa tome what formal expression of our sense of the merits and defects of mr irving  and we perceive nothing in the present volume to mollify the opinion we then delivered either as to the extent of hts powers arid acquirements or to that peculiar direction of them which ensures bira so large a portion of fashionable favour in conformity willi what we then observed we learn that the appearance of these tales has been anxiously looked for in the wellbrea circles to whom after all that is ever the most welcome which sails smoothly on the current of their predominant associations without startling them by any fatiguing originality of thought or offending them wit the inttusiou of a sentiment which can disturb the selfcoinplacency wbioh is their elysium in the article to which we allude we not only endeavoured to show that mr washington irving was essentially a writer of this class but that the curiosity is enhanced anti the approbation more pointed in consequence of so complete a conversion to the tone of the best company of an american republicanif in sinking the sentiment mr i has not also given up the name composition from an angloamerican exhibiting no small portion of the grace and aineuky of the addisonian school in point of expression and that without the occasional annoyance of a sentiment half so bold as even addisons whiggisrn is a curiosity in the world of fashion  not to mention thc insinuating properties of a studied attention to all the estnhlislied notions of the individuals composing it with respect to themselves the adoptions pf their selflove and what they  think they think in relation to a

that notion with the venerable one of the canterbury tales we are first given to understand that the traveller fell sick j at an inn in mentx and composed these volumes during a period of convalescence with little attention to this machinery for such we suppose it to be the first part is entitled  tales of a nervous gentle j man a personification of him who was supposed to relate the very  pleasant story of the  stout gentleman in bracebridge hall they j are related as if told at the hunting dinner of a gentlemanly although foxhunting bachelor of a baronet by the different guests and are  rather incidents or isolated adventures than tales bearing out our general observation that the leading faculty of mr irving is a light and pleasant power of combining reminiscences for of positive inven  tion there is scarcely an iota indeed cur author exhibits a little j consciousness on this score for in his address to the reader he  calls very apprehensively for indulgence therefore although several j of these tales are pleasant in themselves there is scarcely one of them which is not traceable in its elements if not in its concoc  tion the adventure of my uncle for instance is in character and locality a loan from the introduction to quentin durward  the german student is an avowed piece of borrowing and if we recollect aright the only thing not borrowed is a sneer at german mysticism and the destructive fervour of mind and fluctuation of principle prevalent at the era of the french revolution from the tale entitled the mysterious picture in this collection we expected something forcible in the development but it exceedingly disappoints and to say the truth mr irving is not a man to deal with the whirlwind of passionthose tempests of mind which strip human nature of its surface and discover the primary anatomy of the soul to say nothing of length and importance of mrs ratcliffe who did all that a woman can do in this department mn irving must not pretend to bear up the train by far the best piece in this commencing portion of the storytelling is  the bold dragoon related in the person of an irish captain of cavalry it is airy and pleasant in the extreme although from an author not so entirely on the right sideawe might suspect the purity of its morality tm materiel of the next division which is entitled  buckthome and his wends is collected sans peur et sans reproche from the essays and citizen of the world of oliver goldsmith the  literary dinner borrowing additionally from the similar dinner described by smollett in humphry clinker as given by himself to his corps of reviewers it is pleasant in reference to a conversing and a curving partner in the persons of the bookselling firm who give this dinner but we can only say that if the lofty mr murray has told mr irving that he arranges bis guests above and below the salt in the form of a russian noblemans table at which the visitors at the lower end drink inferior wine while those at the head swallow claret he has satirised himself more than his said guests and his laureate and crispinusses more than his  poor devils the oftentold story of a vain young man of common powers coming to london with a manuscript in his pocket which is to make his fortune sinking finally into a hackney writer of all work is anything but new and possibly nothing can less resemble the origin of the existing class of inferior yet necessary retainers of the press than mr irvings tale of  the poor devil author a sketch by the way which does the heart of the author no very extraordinary honour was it even favourable to his head in point of fact the general verisimilitude of all this has gone by and for a very mercantile reasonthere is a more general demand in the market the history of buckthome a supposed mercenary of a higher class is in his character of a dependant on the press a perfect nullity and as to all the rest of him it is hammered out of the adventures of the strolling player in goldsmith there is some pleasantry and now and then a lively and ingenious turn in the narrative but in other respects it is trite shadowy and factitious from beginning to end lite third part takes us to an italian hm at terractna the entire section being devoted to adventures among the italian banditti there is a pleasant portrait of an english milord given beere but still

here that mr ft yiho might have found out that london alds are improveable like other people and that they do not amass fortuna i with precisely the same greasy unintellectuality as in days of yore tl  very mechanics in  merry london town would not in a forei 7 our betray the ignorance of his alderman poplins or of the hobl and the dobbses his satellites being especially protected by the  gentry and instructed by the clergy ignorance so gross is now only to  be found among peasantry be it also known to mr irving that  garrick left off the performance of the london cuckolds more than j half a century ago because he thought such general assumptions ven gross aldermen are still liable to the latter misfortune although not j quite so much so as courtiers but it is no longer polite to assume the j fact as of course may not the imputed ignorance of the municipality of  london claim a similar indulgence  besidesand we are sure that j we shall here be attended to as sir william curtis has recently visited italysome readers may choose to popkinise that rosy amateur of timk  and is not mr irving aware that some of the very highest company endure him  here is a slip much more serious than want of novelty we trust that mr irving will dispatch an explanatory giltedged note to the father of the city forthwith the omission may be serious would however that the foregoing was the only defect in tiie banditti tales but without requiring political observations out of place we cannot help feeling some disgust at a writer who in describing sudh a state of society as these stories treat of is never led into a single generous remark upon the grossness of the tyranny and oppression which can reduce an energetic and capable people into a mental and social bondage so gloomily and inexorably destructive not a wordhowever of this nature is breathed by our american in allusion to this merciless and systematic annihilation of mind and capability in one of the fairest portions of europe

inventions the locality an a scemiy being at firsthand spiritmoving they can scarcely be entitled hut the humour is pleasant and the incident and association less hacknied the story of wolfat weber in reference to force and originality is the best in the whole collection to conclude mr irving is a pleasantimitative writer whose chief merit hes in a light and evanescent vein of humour on the surface
