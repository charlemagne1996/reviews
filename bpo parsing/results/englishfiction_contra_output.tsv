has more of ordinary life in ithas indeed an air of harrowing reality about it which comes home to the convic tions and recalls what has fallen within the experience of thousands there is no over straining in the tale it is an inimitable performance there is nothing in it which has not happened and may not happen againand proves how little occasion there is for going out of the way to pick up

B4974,['6810414'],  tugeru aram wthat has mr wills made of bulwers idea  what will mr irving make of mr willss version of i eugene aram were questions much mooted when we last glanced at what the theatres were doing they were answered on the seventeenth of april when the new play was produced at the lyceum before a crowded and sympathetic audience with every accessory of scenery decoration and costume which the most fastidious admirer of realism could desire mr wills has made a few interesting tableaux out of what bulwer executed as a romance and conceived as a drama to which he doubted his own ability to do justice but he has not made a good play out of it any more than he reduced the readymade tragedy of the life and death of charles the first to the conditions of a good acting drama mr irving makes the most and the best of m1r willss tableaux but he is overweighted by the disproportion of his part and he has to struggle against the inherent unsuitability of the story of  eugene aram for representation on the stage at all unless it were given in its entirety mr wills claims to have adhered neither to bulwers romance nor to hoods poem and in a certain sense he has written his play independently of either though he has taken some of his effects from both it would however be clearly unreasonable to expect that this play should be considered on its own merits only and not to some degree with regard to its proportion to and relation with bulwers novel to which the murderer of daniel clarke owes his posthumous renown outside the records of the  annual register and the  newgato alendar thus considering it the question is naturally suggested why did not mr wills inspired by bulwers idea of a lonely student possessed by remorse and fear out of which he is only partially beguiled by love and whose fate comes up with him just as he is about to marry a beautiful girl refer to bulwers view of how the subject ought to be treated in a dramatic instead of merely adopting it in its romantic form  he had bulwers own exposition of his notions on this point and he had the  fragment of the drama which bulwer commenced but did not proceed with and they make it clear that the novelist perceived and appreciated the nature and uxtent of the difference between the romantic and the dramatic capabilities of the story of crime and misery which had strongly fascinated his imagination bulwer turned the drama into a romance mr wills has turned the romance into a drama in the face of the novelists careful demonstration of the vital distinction in fact the antagonism between the two the novel takes up the murderers life at the point where it is most adapted for description that is for the reverse of dramatic treatment but the  fragment takes it up at the point at which the dramatic element is in its full force that is when motive is most powerful and action most prompt the  fragment might never have been fashioned into a good play but any play founded upon the life of  eugene aram which departs entirely from the method of the fragment must necessarily fail to be a good play in this instance the dramatic instinct has deserted m1r wills and he supposes the existence of a state of consciousness on the part of the audience such as the novelist has it in his power to iniduce by description digression or suggestion but which it is the dramatists business to create we cannot imagine shakespeare bringing the guilty queen on in the first act in macbeth bemoaning herself and washing her hands in her sleep and then the unravelling of motive and the description of the murder of duncan all done backward in a frenzied soliloquy but we follow the skulking figure of rudge the murderer of his master and of his fellowservant through all the pitiful stress of his dastard fear and his remorse which is never repentance until the author of  barnaby rudge discloses the secret with a sense that the exigencies of romance are adequately observed the failure of this dramatic instinct renders the first situation in mr willss play weak and incongruous why should the marriage of the only daughter of the vicar of an important parish with a village schoolmaster be a matter of rejoicing to everybody the vicar included  only it would appear in order that mr wills may not adopt the reasonable side of ibulwers story of a romantic girls love for a learned recluse not divided from her by a hopeless inequality of station while he equally with lbulwer does depart from the fact that euene aram had a wife living at the time of his detection in the revelation to his wife of arams crimeits motive and its perpetration having been made plain to the audience by a prologuethere would have teen an opportunity for the exhibition of true dramatic power in both author and actor an opportunity far more worthy than the declamatory incoherent selfaccusation at the feet of a bewildered girl to whom her moody lover has ever been a problem imposed upon mr irving in a scene impressive indeed demanding the utmost exercise of the actors peculiar skill but which elicits no spontaneous response apart from the tribute of admiration due to that skill because it is untrue to the facts to nature and to the previous indications of the piece in the soliloquy which follows the entrance of eugene aram it is certainly implied to the audience that the remorseful man is in love for the first time in his dark and mysterious life and one of the strongest points of analogy between mr willss play and bulwers romance consists in the conviction entertained by ruth meadows that she is eugenes first love just as a similar conviction delights and satisfies the sentimental madeleine lester of the novel but this theory maintained to the end in the one instance is abandoned in the other in a fashion which is destructive to the ideal of the murderers character as it is put forth in the first scenes it is difficult to believe that the play was written otherwise than piecemeal that the story of the motive for the murder of clarkewhich is neither that imagined by bulwer nor that which really actuated eugene aramwas not concocted for the purposes of the concluding scene so discordant is it with all that precedes it the defect of the play as a composition is the absence of any indication of a previously or actually existing passion in the man to whose past so terrible a history attaches which can explain or account for that history like bulwer mr wills rejects the view of eugene aram as a common thief and assassin but he displays nothing like equal skill in the substitution of a supposed motive for the real one bulwer went as near to the palliation of the murder committed by the schoolmaster as the ingenious representation of an idee fire a devouring passion for learning and the revolt of a gloomy morbidly selfconscious mind against the poverty which fettered all its movements could enable him to go in the  fragment as well as in the novel but mr wills following neither has failed to explain the eugene aram who comes upon the scene a melancholy man indeed but whose melancholy according to his own subsequent explanation of its cause would have barred the approaches of the passion of love that ilulwers eugene aram should have possessed an emancipating angel in madeleine lester is intelligiblehis crime had nothing to do with a woman that mr willss eugene aram should have fallen in love with the parsons daughter is inconceivable his crime having been inspired by the base deception of a woman and his remorse kept alive if he could have forgotten the woman and the crime well and good but he never does forget and the discord makes the whole thing unreal the want of dramatic proportion affects the other characters as well they have no individuality apart from their relation to eugene aram parson meadows is a singularly credulous not to say silly old gentleman with an accommodating indifference to social distinctions which we are inclined to believe was less common in england in the last century than it is in this and so deficient in perception that he could hardly claim with hamlet to know a hawk from a handsaw considering the facility with which he invites houseman one of the most ruffianly ruffians ever produced upon any stage to join the family party on the day before the wedding of his daughter dr primrose is a smart man compared with mr willss parson who has a number of pretty speeches to deliver about arams gentleness and tendt ress about his putting the worm in his path into a place of safety releasing imprisoned birds and winning his pupils hearts they are very pretty speeches indeed there is a good deal of prettiness in the play and a little real poetrybut the gentleness and tenderness of eugene aram have to be taken for granted he is from first to last under the absolute dominion of remorse his love is more full of self pity than of passion his self absorption does not yield to the wouldbe joyous influence of the occasion while yet there is nothing to excite the ever latent fear in his breast it is difficult by the way to conceive a more inconvenient fatherinlaw elect than mr meadows for a man whose dread of the mere passing presence of a  stranger  is so great that the mention of the arrival of such a person suffices to distract his attention from the pretty protestations of his bride on the eve of their wedding here again mr wills while adhering to a portion of bulwers conception of the situation neglects a material constituent in it the murderer in the romance knows who it is who is lurking about threatening to reveal his secret to boland lester but the murderer in the play displays terror at the extremely natural occurrence that it stranger has introduced himself to the notice of the vicar of knaresborough and yet he is wholly unprepared to find that the stranger is houseman his former accomplice again in the story of the dreaded and threatened exposure mr wills is in accord to a certain extent with bulwer but not far enough bulwers aram is a comparatively rich man at all eventshe is in a position to make the coarser villains scheme of clhantage feasible but the village schicolmaster who is going to marry the parsons daughter has no money to be bullied out of and is a likelier subject for the tactics of conciliation which has an eye to the future the concluding scenes which are unlike either the novel or the facts are constructed entirely with regard to the characteristics of mr irvings acting they are made for him as exclusively as his costume is made for him and they become him as well this is in this particular case interesting but it is not drama and in the end we believe it is a system which will be found to be as injurious to the actor as it is unjust to the dramatist it is the most infallible method of encouraging mannerism that could be pursued not mannerism in the higher sense of characteristic conception and rendering but the mannerism which is as often as not mere affectation and which lends itself readily to the purposes of burlesque it dispenses the principal actor in a liece from the finer kind of observation while it taxes his energies in one direction it leaves a whole set of faculties without demand upon them in another it tends to drive him into exaggeration on the one hand and on the other into the carelessness which comes from the absence of comparison and by placing every one else at a disadvantage it deprives him of legitimate assistance pieces made to order in this way are to true dramatic writing just what zuccheros pictures were to really artistic portrait painting in the present instance to only one person besides eugene aram is any interest even supposed to attach it is to ruth meadows his betrothed a part by no means illplayed by miss isabel bateman but hopelessly ineffective because endowed with no vitality except that of the circumstances inconsistent and unnatural because ruth is merely a reflet of eugene arams moods and characteristics bulwer took care to establish an interest in his readers minds for madeleine lester to depict her in strongly individual colours and to sketch her life and associates before he plunged her into the deadly peril of love for an undetected criminal to tell all about her enthusiasm her lofty visionary mind and the studentfancies she holds as faith but that a parsons daughter whom we meet as an ingenue presiding over a village choir lauded by her gardener as the household angel a being of white muslin blue ribbons poetry and posies should mingle the most innocent and orthodox piety with a declaration that if eugene arams hand were even stained with crime she would still regard him with the passionate worship which he has inspired is unnatural and unpleasant not only or chiefly because the sentiment is at variance with every principle on which her life has been trained with every other to which she gives expression but because there is no reason for its suggestion except the authors absorption in eugene arams supposed state of mind and his inability to shift himself to that of any other person however comparatively important in the drama so as to give consistency or vitality to the other characters it is no wonder that miss isabel bateman is artificial and constrained all through she has a most unmanageable lover to deal with one so totally selfengrossed that she is made to appear as she must feel an interruption whenever she is not merely a chorus and the fact is that the only real chance she gets of producing any effect of signifticance is during the brief interval when eugene aram is off the stage in his case also by far the most effective scene is that in which he is quite alone when in the churchyard the murderer in his unbearable agony of remorse makes abject confession to heaven the dramatist puts forth the best that is in him the sense of interruption and incompleteness is lost in that solemn scene full of breathless interest the solitude of the guilty soul isolated by its incommunicable grief is broken by the only commune which has no discord in it and for the first time the legitimate condition for the employment of crime as a motive of dramatic action the inspiring of pity and of fear is fully attained mr henry irvings acting in the character of eugene aram is quite up to public expectation he plays the part with wonderful minuteness elaboration of detail and variety of expression considering the limited range of the emotion and its terrible profundity the slight demand for subtlety in the earlier scenes because every one is perfectly willing to be deceived and the complete surrender of the later scenes in which the presence of houseman in one and that of iruth meadows in another is of no practical account he is unreasonably suspicious and uneasy and preoccupied all through the first scene with ruth but that is the fault of the text he has to interpret  the fine touches in the interpretation the despairing glance over the girls head as it lies on his breast the vague absent smile and the lapse into thought far away from her even while the love words are on his lips and the caressing hands are touching her the writhing under the torture of praise and love in the address from his pupils as it is inflicted by the lips of his bride the shrinking from the pretty details of the weddingall these are his own in the agony and terror of detection in the morbid dread of the poor remains of the man he has slain in his dreadful question to houseman  diditstir  throughout the whole of the concluding scenes mr irving displays increasing power and intensity of expression but the situations are unduly prolonged and in the concluding scene in the churchyard he has too much ground to cover it is impossible to follow him through the contortions of that final agony without feeling that physical effort has too much place in it that it is suffered to divide the attention of the audience with the terrible mental struggle destined to end in utter defeat and death in a proportion which injures the effect of the whole in that one instance only the play is better than the interpretation the words are faultless the action is overdone many other passages of considerable beauty adorn mr willss play but they do not suffice to rescue it from the sentence of mediocrity as a dramatic composition that it is very much better than many plays with which the public have been satisfied of late years is not weighty evidence in favour of either the play or the public but we are far from accepting  eugene aram as the best that mr wills can do the author of  medea and the man o airlie and even of charles the first with all its faults as a drama ought to produce lieces which certain actors should aspire to perform not only pieces which aspire to be percormed by certain actors in the inversion

B8856,['9429114'],  trevlyn hold or squire trtvlyrcs heir new novels bythe author of  east lynne 3 vols tinsley brotherstrevlyn hold is more interesting and less melodramatio than most of mrs woods later works there is nothing startling about it not even a ghost she has succeeded in working out a good story full of action and plot without the aid of any very gross crime there is not a single murder worthy of the name not a robbery commonly so called not a forgery not a divorce case and only a very mild commonplace trial before a few county magistrates and yet strange to say in spite of this forbearance mrs woods new novel is more exciting than any she has produced since her first success in east lynne this is partly owing to her having refrained for once from imparting to her readers any lessons in teetotalism or political economy so that the story runs its course uninterruptedly and is full of interest from beginning to end another marked improvement in trevlyn hold is that there is more delicacy of touch in the delineation of the characters more light and shade than is usual with this author there aresome good points to be found even in members of the unpopular family and we are led to suppose that some of the persecuted race are liable to occasional failings of temper which render them infinitely more lifelike and true to nature than her heroes usually are mrs wood true to herself however is far from neglecting her favourite theory of retribution villany she believes brings its own reward even in this world innocence is sure to triumph sooner or later whether this is always the case in real life we do not feel so confident but in the world of fiction where the author has an unlimited power of bestowing rewards and punishments it would be hard if the wicked were to go scatbless and if the virtuous failed to obtain their rights at the end of the third volume the story of  squire trevlyns heir is as follows the old squire dies leaving one single daughter and two married daughters to succeed to his estates of his two sons one has run away in early youth and is supposed to have died abroad the other always a delicate invalid has died of consumption also abroad leaving a wife and an infant daughter but the squire never knows for it is fraudulently kept from him that joes widow has given birth to a posthumous son who should of course be heir to trevlyn hold the squire is a passionate vindictive old gentleman and tyrannical withal he is angry with his eldest daughter for having married tom ryle the gentleman farmer and he is angry with his son joe for having married the clergymans daughter and it is not difficult to persuade him to leave his property which is not entailed to the other married daughter mrs james chattaway and her children james chattaway has for years established himself at  the hold as confidential adviser and manager of the estates and by persuading or bribing the unmarried daughter to aid him in keeping the secret mr chattaway succeeds in concealing the birth of joes son and securing the inheritance for himself after his own sons rupert and joseph the squire accordingly bequeaths the hold to his second daughter mrs chattawaythus cutting off all hope for though children of his son joe and of his eldest daughter mrs ryle at the time the story opens james chattaway has been for born years in possession of trevlyn hold and his son cris lords it over his cousins bravely as the young squire should do mrs kyle is bitterly aggrieved that her son trevlyn kyle is deprived of his lawful rights and the neighbours generally regard the chattaways as usurpers and interlopers and feel convinced that rupert trevlyn poor joes orphan boy should be if all had their rights the master of trevlyn hold mr chattaway has received into his family joes children for their widowed mother is also dead and a pleasant life rupert and maud trevlyn have of it there mrs chattaway a weakminded helpless woraau does her best for them but she is as much afraid of her husband as they are and she can do but little to help them maud is made governess to the younger chattaways and rupert is honoured with the office of clerk at some mining works on the estate cris and octave chattaway taking good care meanwhile that they shall not be spoilt by any foolish overindulgence from softhearted mrs chattaway aunt diana tbe unmarried miss trevlyn who also resides at the holl is anxious that no gross injustice or cruelty should be perpetrated and so far as she is concerned administers justice to all her nephews and nieces with an even hand the hero of the tale is george ryle mrs ryles stepson a thoroughly upright conscientious young man who with the most unselfish motives manages trevlyn farm for his stepmother and halfbrother pays off all chittaways unjust claims upon them and is ready to retire in his brothers favour the moment he is required to do so of course george ryle falls in love with maud trevlyn and though persecuted with attentions from octave chattaway never swerves from his allegiance to the oppressed governess and equally of course is handsomely rewarded at last rupert trevlyn is however the bestdeveloped character in the book and in his wrongs and sufferings the interest chiefly centres worn out by a long train of daily insults from his uncle and cousins and stung to madness by a horsewhipping unjustly administered for some trifling offence rupert seizing a burning torch plunges it into a hayrick which stands temptingly close at hand and thereby ruins all his hopes of any mercy from the avaricious chattawaywe will not here relate the end of the story for it would forestall the pleasure of reading the book itself assurance may be given that though cruel chattaways are defeated in the most surprising and unexpected manner and that  the hold  becomes the property of its rightful owner all in good time there are some very welldepicted scenes scattered about the three volumes the accident at the mine and the burning of the ricky ard the death of farmer ryle and the advent of the mysterious stranger with the red umbrella are all excellent some of the characters too are original and well contrasted one with the other gentle mrs chattaway and her strongminded bisters airs ryle and diana trevlyn are good so are nora the bustling housekeeper at the farm and ann canham the weakeyed but worthy charwoman at the lodge take it all in all  trevlyn hold is a successful novel and will be more popular than many of its predecessors though perhaps it is not up to the standard of east lynne which seems to be still the work of this prolific author,lishfiction_contra

the children of the ghetto that in this subject he has found his true sphere and that instead of being merely a purveyor of amusing stories and good jokes he is also an artist and the art displayed here is of a very high orderthe art of revealing he beauty inherent in what at first sight is merely ugly or commonplace for mr zangwills polish jews are certainly not obviously beautiful they might almost be called repulsive in some aspects they have associations of squalor and unintelligent superstition which it is difficult to overcome ana indeed mr zangwill does not attempt to overcome them he presents them in all their native ugliness he glosses over nothing he hides nothing and yet he adds just the touch of beauty which raises the commonplace into a fitting subject for art he knows just where to introduce  the droppings of warm tears and the touches of things human till they rise to touch the spheres the most wonderful story of these four is that entitled the sabbath breaker it is about a horrible old polish woman dying in hospital she has been a nuisance to all about her with her querulous exactions but just as she is dying she falls into a torpor when she lives over again the one great episode of her life the episode which makes her human and glorifies her otherwise miserable existence the other really excellent story is 4 the diary of a meshumad of which the chief interest lies in the tenacity of racefeeling displayed even in a jewish renegade the first story is the weakest although the weird likeness of the dwarf to satan is an effective dramatic touch  novel notes ghetto tragedies by i zangwill mcclure as an interpreter of the jew to the gentile at once a naturalist painter of hebrew speech and manners and a revealer of hebrew ideals mr zangwill is already known in this field he has a magnificent opportunity and few rivals the life of modem jews even in london where they are more absorbed in the population than anywhere else has recesses and sanctuaries which few gentiles guess not only in the east end among the poor and the wretched are their religion and ritual a great fact but behind the complacent comfort of jewish villadom there lingers still a wealth of eastern ceremony and sentiment a picturesqueness of custom out of which the spirit has not all died and a tenacity of racial habit without parallel in a shifting age modem hebrew life presents the rare spectacle of a cease less struggle for money which is quite unable to kill the religious and the poetical sentiments mammon is not wholly victor it is not however with the judaism of bayswater that mr zangwill deals here but of the east end and of foreign countries a few of his pages almost convince us that his race has found a masterly interpreter in mr zangwill and the rest is pure disappointment of the four stories  satan makatrig  the diary of a meshumad  incurable and the sabbath breaker the second and third deserve high praise and now and again in al of them the inner life of judaism its exalted moments its fervid domestic affections the significance of its symbols the pathos of its memories are depicted in a way for which we have only the most sympathetic admira tion the religious ecstasy of rivkoly in the first story the early racial instincts of the apostate in the secondinstincts triumphing over all the influences and the selfinterest of his later lifethe painful adherence to every possible letter of the law even in its heroic breach in  the sabbath breaker are described with quiet force but here hesitation comes in in the first place he has not proved that he can write a story rather he has proved that he can markedly fail satan makatrig  is the most ambitious from a narrative point of view but with much good detail it is a jumble of improbabilities a heap of uncalled for exaggerations it is a story of neither this world nor another neither natural nor supernatural striving after effect yet ineffective a study in religious fanaticism and of blasphemous mania it needed sobriety of treatment for want of which it has little coherence and carries no conviction it is difficult at first to say wherein lies mr zangwills defect but we steal upon it in  incurable this sketch of life in an eastend refuge has in it an incident very striking and truly pathetic sarah the bedridden paralytic has a faithless husband she taxes him with his neglect and desertion and he does not deny it but excuses himself with shuffling whining cowardice his wife is not without a feeling of bitter indignation at her luckless fate and scorn for his weakness but she will not have him live in sin and so she commands him to bring her the gettthe voluntary acceptance of which by the wife annuls a marriage the episode is really sublime but it is nearly spoilt by the accessories by the heaping up of the agony of the surroundings by a struggle for effect which overreaches itself the second story which is more reflective than narrative is artistically far better it is the diary of a russian jew who became an apostate in his youth married a christian and brought up his son paul in the christian faith but in the afternoon of his life he finds that the old belief is strong in him still that old memories are dearer and nearer to him than any of the advantages of his apostasy than the thought of his dead wife dearer than anything save paul and paul ignorant of his origin is an orthodox bigot an inciter of antisemitic riots and cruelty the four tragedies are all remarkable full of tender statement and wrapped about by picturesque circumstance but mr zangwill is not yet an artist his earlier literary sins have left him an unfortunate legacy no one can write bachelors clubs and  oid maids clubs with impunity the popular success of such attempts is dearly bought by any one who aims at literature and finds his hand subdued to the baser stuff it has worked in mr zangwill is by nature an idealist he is an idealist who went astray for a time but he is on the right track now,lishfiction_contra

lazy fashion it opened one eye and discovered that an old shrivelled up little man with a brown face was standing by the counter it watched him lazily but warily out of a halfclosed eye and then finding that he appeared to be quite harmless closed it again the intruder was not an impatient type of customer he stood for some time gazing round him then a thought struck him and he approached the cat and stroked it with a masterly hand never in the course of its life had the animal met suoh a born stroker every touch was a caress and a gentle thrum thrum rose from its interior in response something went wrong with the stroker he hurt the cat started up suddenly and jumped behind the counter the dark gentleman smiled an evil smile and after waiting a little longer tapped on the counter the brown man threatened to send a devil to work his revenge that evening the cat goes apparently mad and the jew stumbles over its dead body on his way to bed this is the prelude to a terrible night

do not remember any previous attempt to exploit the language and modes of thought of the east coast smacksmen the rather farcical but honest and successful wooing of capt wilson of the seamew is wholesome and pleasant reading in spite of the occasional failures of his devoted crew of three men and a boy to second his endeavours these simple mariners expose themselves to many adventures and frequent lapses from such cardinal virtues as truthtelling and sobriety in their quest for the missing parent of the fair annis whose hand is to be the reward of success it is possible to read these studies in humble life without the sadness and loathing which attend other realistic descriptions of latterday social phenomena  the brown mans servant is a short and vivid description of a recondite and horrible murder thrown in apparently as a contrast to the pleasant fooling of the longer story,lishfiction_contra

its mystery seemed to have set its mark upon him for even this last tie to the world was threatened next to be torn out of his shattered heart the winter time had set in cauld and grim and a lonely blackness seemed to brood over the ntlhbourhood of leafless carloghie when one dark night towards the middle watches a solitary figure of a woman came stealing towards the farmhouse of reen braes she was dressed richly for a pedestrian yet there was in her appearance and manner au air of wild and rockless dilapidation she sought the window where she saw a light burning i need not say this was the once handsome and proud lady barbara of carloghie with hesitating steps and rising emotion she drew near to the little window there was no screen and she looked in as well as her blinded eyes would allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is far away with them that never loved her as i have done  and now thou art her last saddest remembrancer and cold deaths creeping up to thy young heartand 1 am a bereft and brokenhearted man he stopped suddenly choked by his sorrow and thought he heard a noise without it was barbara groping agitatedly for the latch of the door the sounds were low but became shaip and abrupt and the door moved as if the walking spirit of death sought hasty admission in another instant the figure of a female wanderer stood before him and the pale and haggard countenance of bis own barbara appeared by thc dim light

of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated

of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of

grounds indeplently of the mythological and philological interest attached to the dear existence of these stones this collection is valuable for another reason in it is preserved authentic remnants of pure scotch gaelic in the spoken lic as it flow exists there are three elements the irish gaelic of the chi bithe printed religious gaelic of later times which dates after he f  anntion ad the pure scotch gaelic of the morven and tine weurchan districts of ar leshire and of the western islands which b lenained uncorrupted by the english idioms that exist in perthshire d the lrishisns elsewhere the pure vernacular language is more perfectly werved in legendary tales and in poetry orally handed down than in written rw into which foreign idioms must gradually creep hence the value of p cl pupular ales as these and of such poetry as that of the uncultivated d3 published recently in the book of the dean of lismore it is another qesti how far it is desirable to foster the gaelic language or to let it die vttif it is to be preserved there can be no doubt on this point that it ought tobe preserved as far as possible in its original purity in these ballads nd stories handed down from generation to generation by oral tradition perfection of the original dialect is a necessary ingredient mir campbell beu collected these tales from the mouths of the speakers and thus he has done good service in preserving his favourite language pure and uncorrupted on these various grounds there can be but one verdict upon the three first lous of mr campbells book every one must thank him for his work and congratulite him upon the result of his undertaking it is a disagreeable task to find fault with what has given us so much pleasure but it is the duty of the reviewer to state his conviction honestly and it is more satisfactory for the author to see such a conviction expressed h toreadso many lines of undiscriminating laudation miscalled criticism the publication of the fourth volume is to be regretted twothirds of this rolume are occupied by the resuscitation of the ossianic controversy most people considered that it was buried and left to the oblivion of its grave it was not beautiful in its life in its resurrection it is not more imposing mr campbell raises the dead body but he fails to galvanise it into existence not one man in a hundred who will read his book can now feel the smallest interest in that exhausted controversy and if any interest was excited it would not be satisfied with the manner in which mr campbell reopens the discussion he is indeed an easy and agreeable controversialist neither flippant nor sarcastic but pleasant bantering and on this subject sensible but he is unsatisfactory he does not grasp the question thoroughly or handle it vigorously he is sadly inconsequent and inconsistent he begins with clearness and logical precision but soon falls away into digression and rambling desultory writing the reader is left much where he was he closes th book and has learned nothing similar accusations must be brought against mir campbells mythological fragments and his plea for gaelic there is throughout both these portions of his book a want of scholarlike thoroughness the argumentation is feeble sometimes frivolous and the whole discussion is pervaded by a superficiality that is the reverse of satisfactorv the following passage will show that this accusation is well founded if it was important for the interests of the state to found a chair of sanscrit which nobody speaks surely there ought to be some means of learning gaelic devised for england where a large section of the people speak the language sti this is unworthy of mr campbell on the same principle he would abolish all the chairs of latin and greek in the different universities and would establish in their place professorships of the language of the japanese and the maories it is of a piece with these two passages which at best are trifling and superficial iny one who knows gaelic can easily put a meaning on numbers of italian ames for example monte soracte monadh sorachan mountain peak or hi1lo is a small peaked mountain standing alone near rome monte afppennino mlonadh na beinne the mountain tract of the hill country is at last as descriptive in gaelic as italian and the sounds are very like still  english is a  bar to the advancement of proprietors if they cannot speak those who pay their rents and it is the want of english not the pos ion of gaelic which retards the advance of those who seek employment ere english is spoken so highland proprietors should learn gaelic and teach rlish gaelic is no bar to advancement it did not clog the steps of the lord ricegeneral or his brother the ambassador or of the vicechancellor or of us of other men of mark whose learning included gaelic it has not ighed in my slower race through life and it gave me a stock of sounds which in other languages and which an english tongue can rarely pronounce wt do not fec fn controvert the position advanced in this last passage fallacy implied in the use of the word  advancement  must be plain to r campbell himself when a man of mr campbells ability allows hims to write on a great question in this very inefficient manner his best iise is that his celtic proclivities at times get the better of his reason in pa for gaelic and in his idealisation of the highland costume on which etio we lo not propose to enter his celticism becomes ungovernable otally forg ets his acceptation and assertion of the aryan theory of lan and instead of looking upon gaelic as an offshoot of aryan he appears consider aryan as an offshoot of gaelic he gets upon his hobby and it away with hiii it is as uncontrollable as jains niare to whom the sea landare all one it gives its front to the sea and its back to the  and son carries him beyond his depth and leaves him hopelessly at it i a pity that this volume has been published in it mr campbell up then questions which he ought either to have left untouched or to worked out with much more thorough elaboration any one who has the masterly dissertation on subjects similar to those here treated

tales of the west hiejhlands orally collected with a translation bv j f campbell vols iii and iv edmonston  douglas we have two more volumes of mr campbells contributions to the existing mass of celtic literature they will be perused perhaps with some disappointment by those who received with alacrity and pleasure his former two volumes and readily appreciated the hearty nationality and good humour of the collector it is however in the nature of things that a second gleaning should not offer such rich results as the first the first of these new volumes contains mythological tales fables and ossianic ballads and the last is a volume of dissertations by mr campbell on the ossianic controversy gaelic poetry british traditions highland dress ornaments and mythology of the ossianic portion a good deal of the interest has been forestalled by the recent publication of the dean of lismores book and other ossianic publications nevertheless such versions as mr campbell has collected will be of use to the celtic scholar the compiler however entertains the ambition of setting the ossianic controversy at rest once and for ever but in this he mistakes his capabilities  as a collector he has done good service but he has too little of the critical faculty to render his opinions of much value most highland gentlemen imagine that nobody but a highlander is competent to pass judgement on their literature or on the genuineness of a certain portion of it but this ian entire mistake the mere possession of a knowledge of highland gaelic is of little moment for the purpose in view with whatever facility a man may speak gaelic that in itself is no evidence of his capacity to pass judgement on the genuineness of a single ossianic poem this will be apparent to any one who considers how few englishmen well read in english literature would be competent to pronounce a verdict on any newlydiscovered poem said to be by gower or chaucer how many englishmen who have not made such things their study are there at the present day who would discover rowleys poems to be forgeries from a mere inspection of their diction  indeed the general critic unacquainted with gaelic who has compared the poetic evolutions of thought and sentiment in other languages ii far more likely to come to a right conclusion i such matters than the mere speaker of gaelic but the critic av ho is now required to take th matter in hand is the scientific philologist who shall be neither a scotchman an irishman a welshman nor a breton at least in feeling and prejudice but a celt one who shall take up th whole of the literature of the celtic races and edit their legendary and traditional relics with true impartiality philosophic insight scrupu lous comparison and broadness of view suojb an investigation

day capable of embracing the whole range of celtic literature and marshalling the literary treasures of its various dialects in due order and showing the affinities which subsist between the different legends in the different countries of all the labourers in the field of celtic antiquities who have hitherto done good service none deserves more honourable remembrance than owen jones the poor peasant of myvyr who unassisted by patronage devoted his life to the preservation of the literature of his country he came up t london a poor boy engaged as a clerk in somecity establishment and after forty years f selfdenial with the accumulations of his hard won scanty earnings published the myvyrian archaeology at his own cost in 1801 and 1807 and it is from this repertory that sharon turner was enabled to draw his welsh legends and bardic poems in the first volume of his history where they first attracted the attention of m villemarque it was a work which might havebeen done by a king an institution or a society ofthe noble and the learned but it was accomplished and scrupulously accomplished by a poor welsh peasant nor must we forget the great service rendered to the literature of her country by lady charlotte guest whose three splendid volumes of the mabinogion with their fine paper type and steel engravings form a direct contrast in costliness of production tethe three modest and closelyprinted quartos cf poor owen jones the mabinogion is however also an invaluable treasure and there are the favourite topics of the most celebrated troubadours of mediaeval europe to be

notiaia of the primitive beauty of these old tales till they read them in  the mabinogion it is curious however that the mabinogion clas of story seems to have no points of contact with taliesin and the bardic literature yet the welsh popular tales have certain undoubted analogies with the gaelic legends arthur and guinevere for example have a certain likeness to finn or fion and grainne his wife and lancelot and diarmaid have a resemblance for in both canes the beautiful warrior is the cause of the infidelity of the queen and in both eases he is more tempted than tempting a resemblance has also been attempted to be traced between oisein or ossian and taliesin hut on this as on many other points criticism will suspend its opinion till philology has done it work with more scrupulous severity  the literary iaier popular tales of the west highlands orally collected i with a translation by j f campbell two volumes edinburgh edmonston and douglas a better book of its kind than this no country possesses dr dasents norse tales are of high value and the relation of scandinavian mythology or legend to our own folk lore as well as to the traditions of the east is very close but gaelic of the british islands interests us even more than the traditions of the norse and mr campbell while he takes in his work as a collector all the interest of a philologist and shows a complete sense of the value of literal accuracy in placing the old popular tales of the west highland gaels within reach of all students of literature proves himself by the manner of his introduction to be not only a scholar but a man of genius his vi porous and graphic english and his curious felicity of illustration are of a sort very seldom to be met with in asciation with the scholarly exactitude for which these tolumes are conspicuous it is a very great addition to the value of the work that not only are the stories taken in gaelic from the lips of west highlanders collated compared and when proved by the form of their frequent occurrence to be true traditions of the gael set down in the closest of translations all the closer for being also nervous english but the gaelic itself has been taken down and printed hector urquhart gamekeeper at ardkinglas on loch fyne and hector maclean schoolmaster at ballygrant in islay have been mr campbells chief helpers in this part of his work a body of gaelic literature is thus taken from the lips of the people and fixed before the ministers and schoolmasters shall have silenced the last reciters of tradition that has lived through generation after generation the old days of telling tales or sgeulachd by the highland fireside are even now passing away as hector urquhart depoes i knew an old tailor who used to ted a new tale every night during his stay in the village and another an old shoemaker who with ilis large stock of stories about ghosts and fairies used to frighten us so much that we scarcely dared pass the neighbouring churchyard on our way home it was also the custom when an aodia or stranger cele brated for his store of tales came on a visit to the village for us young and old to make a rush to the house where he passed the night and choom our seats some on beds some on forms and others on three iokestd i 5insulto gh now ta  ju u i ha o whn a rfaed acor ca om to persan in the gtheave the goodman 1 th e uually

riddles in the solving of which all zn the hoos had to tax their ingenuity if one of the party put a riddle which asnot osved thatnight he went home with the title of king of riddles besides this there was usually in such gatherings a discussion about the fei which comes from fantamdh giant the fantaibh were a body of men who volunteered to defend their country from the invasions and inroads of the danes and norwegians or loclusia fiu who was always called king of the fein was the strongest man amongst them and no person was admitted into the company who was les in height than he however much taller i remember the old black shoemaker telling us one night that fiunk had a tooth which he consulted as an oracle upon all important occasions he had but to touch this tooth and whatever he wanted to know was at once revealed to him the above is all i can at present readily call to mind of the way in which the evenings were spent in the highlands thirty or forty years ago the minister came to the village in 1830 and the schoolmaster 1 soon followed who put a stop in our village to such gatherings and in their place we were supplied with heavier tasks than listening to the old shoemakers fairy tales from that period till i collected the few in this collection i have not heard a tale recited on going to visit my friends last summer i expected that i would get some old tales among them but i found that the most of the old men who used to relate them in my young days had died and the few who were then alive of them were so old that they bad lost their memories so that i only got but a trifle to what i expected it was doing no small service to literature to save these tales from perishing giving them to the english student in his own language to the gael and the student of gaelic in the exact words of the teller with the tellers name and habitat assigned to every one as precisely as a botanist would name the habitat of any plant in his collection mr ijrquhart in the letter we have quoted speaks of tales of the fein or fenii the first of our volunteers the irish and scotch gaels have many of these legends in common for all tradition bears witness to the close association in old timesin the third century if we may accept the date commonly assigned to fionnbetween ireland and the western isles of scotland and that mainland of alban the alpland or highland from which we have derived the name of albion the fein were the first of british volunteers sworn say the irish legends to defend their shores against invasion and each bound to fight nine men of any other nation who should challenge them their marvellous qualifications have been often told oisin ossian the son of fionn commanded the more ambitious of the two clans into which it split and he according to the book of hoath was sole survivor from the battle of gabhra in the year 296 he could live therefore to have his dialogue with st patrick and to be unwillingly converted by the saint quite apart from the extinct controversy about macphersons ossianie work which is now generally admitted to have been a sentimental rendering of gaelic traditions into a form suited to the english humour of his day all that can now be collected of traditions of the fein has a strong interest three years ago a weak effort was made by mr j h simpson in poems of oiain bard of erin to present to the public these traditions from the irish side his book included six or eight fenian traditions orally collected from among the mayo peasantry and incomplete and unsatisfactory as it was it has in the absence of a better certain literary value we trust that mr campbells example will now stimulate some irish scholar to do for the gaels of his own island what has been done so thoroughly for those of the western highlands giving as mr campbell has given precise authority for all that he prints and the gaelic of the storyteller as well as his own translation mr campbell himself with curiosity strongly excited and much baulked during a visit to the isle of man asks for a manx man who will fix also the legends of the manx gaels before in these days of schoolmasters who consider it their duty to discountenance all oldwives tales the oral literature that he compares aptly to the driftwood floated from a faroff world shall have been utterly destroyed we may question the speculation that can find analogies between the fairies and the lapps that will trace celtic fairy legends back to the supposed tatar tribes thinly spread over europe before the days of the great halfl historical invasions of cimmerians and goths those tribes that according to professor worsaae left their traces in the coast barrows containing only tools and weapons of shaped stone pass for the aborigines of europe who are represented in the south by the basques and in the north by the finns esths and lapps but there is ground even for that speculation which appears so fanciful and it is not so hostile as at first sight it may appear to another speculation that connects the fairy with the peri however that may be it is on this earliest period of european history that we may expect light to be thrown by an extended study of the popular traditions of all nations there can be no doubt also that this is the right time of year for a profound speculation on the fairies mr campbell who has himself spoken gaelic from his childhood went systematically upon storyhunting tours as other men engaged by other sciences set out upon botanical or geological excursions his specimens were of a kind to be got only by the skilful thus we are told how he went at easter to a highland district near the lowlands where a gamekeeper bad marked down a lot of taletellers and i was soon convinced that there was plenty of game though bard to get the difficulty may be worth some explanation for it exists elsewhere and bears on the collectior of tales everywhere highland peasants and fishermen especially those dwelling near the lowlands are shy and proud and even more peculiarly sensitive to ridicule than peasts elsewhere mauy bawc a lurking belief in the truth of the sioies whi they tell man a 3 eated castlatom tha wi ym with a better educaon will la1g at the bliet northwest the stay an the nu raw and his landuage f he should bwei enough to ventin on english and betroa his knowledge of seultachd and his creed e cannot im n that any on out of his owf clan am possibly be amused by his fivolous p sim no one ever has hitherto he sees every year a summer flood of tourists of all a ou ring through his loa sandglens but he knows as little of them as they know of him the shoal of herrings that enter loch syne know as much of the dundoer on the hialssde a londoners and highland peasants know of each other each gets an occaioial peep at the other as the deer may see the herrings capering on the locheach affeeb the other slowly but surely as the herrings do drive away the wild deer by attracting men to catch them but the want of a common language here as elsewhere keeps highlands and lowlands celt and saxon as clearly eparate as oil and water in the ame glass the first step then towards the acquisition of a story is to establish confidence it may be that the wouldbe collector sees before him a strapping lad dressed in the garb of a west country fishermana rough blue bonnet jacket and trousers he steps out and ranges up alongside the highlander glances from under his busby eyebrows and sees with his sharp grey eyes that the new comer is a stranger he looks rather like a saxon highland curiosity is strong and he longs to ask whence he comes but politeness is stronger and it would be uncivil to begin questioning at once so with a nervous kick of one foot and a quick shy glance the fisherman jerks out  its a fine day  tha n latha briagh  the day is fine replies the stranger and as he speaks the whole face and manner of his companion change as if by magic doubt and hesitation suspicion and curiosity become simple wonder his eyes and his heart open wide at the sound of his native tongue and he exclaims you have gaelic  you will take my excuse by your leave but what part of the gaeldom are you from  and then having found out all that is to be discovered the ice being broken and confidence established it oozes out gradually that the fisherman knows a story and after much persuasion he tells it while he rows the gentleman who can talk gaelic across a high land loch at parting he adds that he has only told it to please a  gael and that he would not have said one word to a gall stranger but the man who is fluent in his boat is shy and awkward when set down to repeat his story for transcribing and it is only when set with one of his neighbours whom he knows that his story is got on paper or it may be an old dame in a tall white mutch with a broad black silk band a red cloak and clean white apron she is seventy and can walk ten miles she has known all the neighbouring families for generations if you can claim cousinship with any she is your friend but she will praise the ancestors and tell of the adventures of bob roy the gregoracl the last of the freebooters but mary can you say murachag and mionachag huch my dear that is an ursgeul that is nonsense the good being bless you i knew your grandmother etc etc so one must rest contented with the fact that old mary knows one tale and probably many more which a weeks persuasion might perhaps extract and so forth the tales when got are often rude but sometimes excellent even to the spoilt modem taste the riddles in which celts delighted as much as the early anglosaxons are singularly pointless but some of the fables are as neat as man can wish nothing for example can be better than the fable of the fox who sat on his tail for a gossip with the cock in the farmyard and asked him how many tricks did your  mother teach you    three he said  how many have you been taughttwo or three thousand i know one that is capital i can shut my left eye and scream so as to wake a parish i can do that said the cock so he shut his left eye and began to crow with all his might the fox on the blind side of him snapped him up and was running away when the farmers wife looking out of doors cried iheigh fox stop that is  my cock tell herthe cocks yours whispered the victim so the fox opening his mouth cried to the dame the cock is mine  then it was his no longer out of a tolerably thorough study of the folk lore of all nations that has based on works like this but to which few so good as this are likely to contribute a most interesting and important book has to be written we have in these tales variations upon bluebeard and upon known stories of almost every land thus the incident in the battle of the birds of the giants beautiful daughter hid in a tree top over a well we read last with all its details as an incident in one of jacob ayrers plays a german translation of the english play from which shakespeare may have taken the first notion of the tempest  popular tales of the west highlasdst  the northwestern perts of scotland says an old dutch geographer are inhabited by irishmen the southeastern parts by englishmen this distinction one of the highest importance when these words were written is now of little practical value and is hence often overlooked intercourse between the two races to which he refrrs having almost obliterated the differences between them it must be clearly apprehended however by any one who would understand aright the history of scotland or the subjects discussed in the learned and able introduction to these volumes the scottish lowlands densely peopled by an english population were at all times permeable to the influences acting upon the civilised countries of europe every new continental school of philosophy or literature sent a wave of thought or feeling over this island which only broke when it reached the welldefined frontier of the highlands the old scottish knights who threw off the yoke of the english kings were closely connected with france and through france with all the latin countries of southern europe some of them indeed had been educated in the schools of paxis need we feel surprised then to hear that robert brace when he osted weary and travelstained by loch lomond side under the birch and the rowan trees with his mailclad followers withthomas randolph and hugh de ia hay and good sir david de berkelay read to cheer their spirits and wile away the time tales of gallantry and prowess from the pages of an old french romance a generation later and the first great poem in the english tongue recorded the exploits of the good king and his companions and told by its references to the nitingale and its use of the commonplaces of romance how much the literature of scotland had been influenced by the troveres and the troubadours the reformation burst forth in germany and forthwith appeared the evidence of a close intercourse between scotland and the low countries before the storm had reached the frontier of france the northern parliament had passed an act to prohibit  skippers  from introducing heretical books from the continent and friars were denouncing from the market places as familiar namesmartin luther that saw loon black bullinger and melanctoon a ery different state of things prevailed in the highlands there the people spoke a language unintelligible to the english of the lowlands their flinty hills attracted no foreign priesthood their old celtic institutions repelled feudalism no norman aristocracy introduced into the land the study of southern romance no highland students rose to fame at pari or padua the irishry or selvages of the highlands lived apart altogether from the traditions of the great continental world with ireland however the connexion of the highlands was intimate just as the english dialects of the people melt into each other between london and aberdeen the dialects of the erse pass gradually into each other between cork and inverness the people of the highlands ireland and the isle of man formed indeed one people the early history of the erse race is ill undertood six centuries before christ they are supposed to have reached the british islands already occupied by the welsh or british races and to have settled in ireland and northern scotland their oldest traditions throw little light however on this event they record the exploits of the brave tribes of the feene and more especially of fin mac coul thegreat hero of the race it is frm one of his epithets  miledh the warrior that the monkish chroniclers devised the story of milesius the word seene being after a similar fashion perverted into phamician the poems which record the exploits of the seene bore in some respects the same relation to the erse people that the homeric poems bore to the greeks many ments of them are yet preserved by oral tradition some have been committed to writing the gaelic poems of ossian which were formed of passae from poems of the feene have been proved to be authentic and he who now calls their genninenes in question

the persons from whom they have been gathered are housemaids nurses and old women drovers fishermen blind fiddlers and tinkers tailors and shoemak are however the principal tribuators the reason is

gatherings the sgeulachd have been set down just as they were told by mr campbell he well remarking that it would be as absurd to tamper with such relics as to gild an old copper coin or to paint the fossil bones of an ichthyosaurus one of the most striking and characteristic of these highland tales is that of i the southeast maiden told by an old fishean in the hebrides it is a tale to be found in all the european langaages it resembles an irish  fenian story taken from a very old ms there is something much akin to it in sanscrit it is a version of shortshaiks in the norse tales of dasent grimms german tales contain it its incidents appear in the classical stories of  perseus and an dromeda and hercules and hesione it is in the italian of strapanola as fortunio and in the french of the6 cabinet des fees it is in every lan guage in europe as st george and the dragon it is the story of sheep shanks  in a ms collection of lowland scotch tales made by mr peter buchan in 1847

to say he hag  set down stories told him by the egyptian priests which reappear in the high land tales k in the introduction to which we have already referred mr campbell endeavours to ascertain the date of the tales he has recorded and to ascertain whether his countrymen have derived them from other european nations or have inherited i them from old primaeval times to some it may be difficult at first eight to under stand how this is possiblean illustration may serve to explain it when an old wall was disinterred some years ago in paris a dispute arose as to its age some said it was roman others that it was medkeval  let us pull down one square ard of it said an antiquary  and i will be bound to say that you will find precise evidence of its date the wall was dragged down and in the very heart of it there was found an onamnt of the renaissance the building was proved to belong to a late period in modern history mr campbell has subjected these tales to a somewhat similar testcomparbng them with other stories to ascertain if they contain incidents which indicate the source by which they have head this island examined in this way he thinks that they have not been rived through the same channels as the old fairy tales but like the breton irman and norse tales recently published in truth ae directly derived from people in a very primitive stage of civilization here are a few of the consi rations which lead to this conclusion the hero often saves many maidens and weds them all this implies a state society at the period of their importation among the irish people

popular tales that combs were but those who have travelled among halfcivilized people understand what is meant when the knight lays his head on the ladys knee and she dresses his hair the giants may

part of the harm though of course it is an extrinsic one in the stories whlicih mr camnphell has collected for tile first time lies in thle fiamiliarity ever and anon of the incidents and characters

unlettered and unreading speaking anl hearing only its native ralic sometimes mr campbell has to seek a parallel in a novel of boccaccio or in an episode of a sanscrit epic for a passage in the narrative which he has gleaned from the lips of the blind fiddler of islav or the septuagenarian cottier of south uist it is another proof ailded to the many already existing ot the common origin of the family which plhiloloists used to call the indogermanic the philological proof is an excellent ind irrefragable one but this irawn fron the similarity ot or recurrence of incidents in tales popular from the himalayas to the hebrides is one of the pleasantest and most interesting that we know lwe think however that mr campbell has somewhat exaggerated the historical value of these stories

B333,"['6818244', '8921068', '3178068']",  fiction the queens tragedy by robert hugh benson pitman bs whatever else may be thought of father bensons latest historical novel no one will fail to find it fresh suggestive and interesting it keeps one asking is this true  was that wisely done  which was the right course in those circumstances such questionings mean that the book both holds attention and stimulates the mind to speak of the fiction as distinct from the history is really impossible for the two are interwoven like warp and woof so i address myself to the latter at once different as the judgments of protestants and catholics havecbeen about queen mary all agree that her reign closed in disappointment even before the worst had arrived father benson describes her feelings thus eighteen months ago she had been so happy the legate hd come with a splendour that promised great things england she thought had been restored to unity  her husband had been with her the babe had leapt in her wombthe dear babe that was to take up the government when she laid it down now it seemed as if all were a ghastly delusion the legate indeed still here but how powerless the heartshaking scene in westminster hall was no more than the rehearsing of a play that seemed postponed indefinitely her husband had disappeared into silence and the leap of the child was a thrill o a horrible disease    she had begun by hoping that    b restoring little by little the old worship the light of faith would be rekindled and her people had answered by attacking her priests mocking her religion and weaving sedition and heresy so inextricably together that it was impossible to punish the one without glorifying the other that is graphically as well as truly and sympathetically put in mary we see good intentions and mistaken policy tending to failure and failing while on the other side stands elizabeth worldly wise and unscrupulous knowing that she will win and winning in conclusion marys  star sets in gloom while the courtiers almost to a man slip away to worship the rising sun the main interest therefore and the chief problems are connected with mary but there is also a romantic element guy manton a cambridge master of arts is introduced an unconventional but interesting character whose development shows us what father benson thinks would have been the line taken during those troubles by one  of cathouc character he  is human of course and we see in him the degrading effect of the burnings having watched them he becomes aa he himself confesses a hard devil the obsession is admirably described with all the power of psychological and religious analysis in which father benson excels the narrative too here reaches a high degree of excellence man tons fidelity is put to a dramatic test and he wavers in the end however his better nature conquers but at was said before the true interest of the book lies in pure history and what of that history  to me it seems that in its main outlines it is unimpeachable the trials the successes and failures of the historical characters correspond with what actually took place for the rest the author has attained that degree of vrai semblance which is to be expected in a historical novel as we descend to details however we note the points at which differences of opinion will begin to assert themselves extremists will of course never be fully satisfied the admirers of foxe though they will find some things to their liking will not find enough believers in the inspiration of nicholas sander will not relish the way in which la ti mer and his confreres are praised  for as much as they did wisely enthusiasts for elizabeth and they are many will say that her portrait has been too darkly drawn but for my own part i think that a more notable error is one bearing hardly on queen mary as for elizabeth though no one would assert nowadays that se was truthful yet on the other hand no evidence is forthcoming to prove her such an unblushing hypocrite and traitor to her sister as she is here represented to have been this is true i think and yet father benson does not seem to me to have here exceeded the licence always allowed in a historical novel for as soon as he looked beyond marys reign and considered the contrast between elizabeths conduct before and after its terminationand perhaps pondered the wording of the coronation oath which she took in the hands of the old catholic prelates when she had fully decided on the measures for the overthrow of the old religionhe would feel fully justified in attributing to her as much as he has done of trickery and of faithlessness but however this may be i pass to a more important question is the mary tudor of this novel correct ly drawn from life  she is here a stupid woman conscious of her lack of wit and gaiety  unable to win love and affection and she is constantly losing herself in dreams her  mans voice  and prematurely aged appearance are insisted upon in and out of season i do not think that this is good portraiture it was perhaps tiue of her last days when the bloodletting and the other barbarities of contemporary leechcraft had brought her down to a shadow of her former self but this was not the woman who has made her mark on our history the dispatches of the ambassadors who came into actual contact with her show that she was active matteroffact well informed queenly and gifted with great insight into the men and matters that came under her notice it may be regretted that father bensons story concerns itself with the gloomy part of her reign exclusively even if otherwise faultless a picture so drawn is bound to be somewhat onesided of course there are also smaller points which might be discussed if space allowed he seems to me to be too hard upon philip too favourable to pole and to underestimate marys dislike of her halfsister which so good an authority as a venetian ambassador has called  hatred when elizabeths life was in the balance it was saved by philips intervention this would hardly fit in with some of fathers bensons most striking scenes whatever may be the objective truth about the points i have criticised it is clear first that they will not affect the the queens tragedyexcept in details which are nonessential and secondly that father benson has been so much on his guard against showing too much partiality for his coreligionists that when he does err it is generally to their disadvantage vuviau iv iuvii uiaauvauiac jh pollen sj  the queens tragedy  by robert hugh  benson sir isaac pitman  sons it is the novelist rather than the annalist who seems able to tell the truth about mary tudor that she was human and a woman is of service to her reputation as soon as we come close to her but proximity in this case can only be attained by imagination mr benson has not only come close to her  his mind has also glowed with sympathy for her she is in his pages a piteous woman the sport of extreme irony without peril to her devoutness and on her deathbed visited graciously by phantasmal children of heaven she is unintellectual she toils at embroidery  ridley and latimer are burnt and we see the candle lit that is not extinguished  yet for an hour or two we are loyal to mary because mr benson though no apologist is the voice of the pathos that is hers first love a passion for philip of spain in the breast of a woman of thirtyseven is tragedy in suspense from its commencement and the novelist makes her foolish heart flutter before us till we need the annalist to reduce the temperature of our pity there is no love story in the book except the queens instead of the usual fictitious wooing there is a deeply interesting study in manhood the subject being a fellow of cambridge who has left the university to become one of the queens gentlemen his aim is to be hard enough for his loyalty and the witnessing of torture he succeeds in spite of his tenderness for a friend in trouble a priest however is shrewd enough to divine that he is a man at wilful war with his own nature the writing at the end of the book is fine and grandiose  the queens tragedy by robert hugh benson 6s pitman one matter for congratulation is that mr benson has not made his new historical novel from the easy recipes that have been so popular of late years that they have grown tircsomelv conventional he has given us no lovely persecuted heroine and no dahinv and irresistible hero who is always arriving everywhere just in the nick of time to do something thrilling and saive the situation in a style that is admirably lucid and simple though one wvishes he would curb an inclination to colloquialism when one reads of people being horribly il horribly distressed or horribly startled i he teils the story of the dark and troubled reign of queen mlary as it was known to guy manton who served her alaestv as a gentleman usher he has drawn the pathetically unlovable character of mary clearly and with a very sympathetic insight and has woven the principal events of her life and the leading men of her age into a brilliant and fascinating romance that is the better and more intvresting fo being occasionally coloured ith something of partiality for her cause the closing sccne where the queen lies dying deserted and almost alone is a finrw inainecd and poignant piece of work alike for its

B7932,['8565754'],  tlte fortunes of nigel literary notices by the author of waverley sec  knifegrinder story  lord bless you i have none to tell sir poet ry of the a ntijacobin we have copied the motto with the title of this new production of the most fertile imagination ofthe day because it will spare a world of criticism as a tale the fortunes of nigel is a mere abortion and the author is so conscious of it that he has constructed an intro ductiou of no mean length to prepare us for the fact and to excuse itan introduction by the way which wa should have liked full as well if it had exhibited less ofthe equivocal slang of blackwood magazine we hare no objection to a little deportment en cavalier from an individual who cfttsctyqs of merit and the art of pleasing despises the cent

defects of the story or the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political emergencies before his accession to the throne of england and the sole business of the story is to relate nis fortunes tn a journey to london to induce honest king james to repay it here we roust observe that a phenomenon is exhibited which from an author north of tweed approaches to the miraculouswith a w minor exceptions of no great moment every scousttan io the book

uniformly playing for low stakes with inferiors and as regularly winning upon this piece of north british prudence indeed most of toe adv en ture in these volumes is made to depend for it enables acotert enemy to disgrace him at court aud it is this disgrace which supplies nearly the whole of the incident bearing in mind the authors account of hit manner of writing his unfavourable scottish portrait ture may be almost accidental but it is an accident from which our northern brethren are so genet all preserved we have hitherto concluded that its avoid ance might be safely left to instinct the story opens iu the very best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it is accounted for while physically accurate is certainly imaginatively disgusting contrary however to all anticipation abe does not prove to be the heroine and the lady who is so is after all only a diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public will be extremely disappointed bnt this is of little import to an author who can so effectually plead privilege he has only to trim the lamp of hie nriegmation southwest begin again  we observe in the

qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage becomes transparent in the opening chapters to all resent and to come therefore be it known that porthgenna tower with the premises adjoining is the tomb aud temple of n great family mystery captain and mrs trevertonthe former the lord of lands and monies the latter the daughter of an actress have there their local habitation  with them resides their only child rosamond mrs trevertons servant is called sarah leeson and in the first scene this woman is summoned to the deathbed of her mistress she is compelled by her domestic allegiance to write a letter to her master which the wife signs anil the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both be dont talk so dont talk so tellme quietlydear dear mother tell me quietly hush hush i am going to tell you she threatened me on her deathbed if i thwarted her she said she would come to me from the other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead

new issue of the dead secret in our literary summnzar last week  btit a niore detailed criticism is called for alike by the justly eminenit positwn of the author and the sterling character of the work itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

B4015,"['6785067', '9406189', '8679551']",  the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a

applaud the omission of needless indelicacies in the translation of this very tale libussa is an excellent example of the spirit in which he took up old legends and of the halfmodern satirical garb he dressed them in two very powerful stories somewhat alike in their moral drift are the criminal from lost honour of schiller and the michael kohl haas of heinrich von kleist schillers would show that the extremes of guilt are never more surely engendered than by degrading punishments awarded to trivial offences von kleists that a man driven to desperation by the denial of justice may be made a criminal by his outraged sense of right this latter tale is unequal but we know few things in fact or fiction more masterly than the first half of it the scene where with forced calmness michael listens to the outrages committed on his servant is a piece of high tragedy the writer afterwards plunges into historical detail and somewhat soils his fancy with the thick dust of german chronicles but heinrich von kleist not to be confounded with an older author christian ewald von kleist was a remarkable person he belonged to what was called the romantic school bis works are edited by tieck at

delighted with his dwarf seeing satisfaction expressed on the countenance of his ifutt hut on the fifteenth day it happened that the duke while at table sent for the dwarf presented him to his guest and asked bow he was satisfied with his cooking m  you are a wonderful cook replied the prince and know what good living is all the time 1 have been here you have not repeated a single dish and have prepared everything exquisitely hut pray tell me why have you not all this time prepared that queen of dishes the pie called  souseraine    the dwarf was startled at this question for he had never heard of this queen of pies however he recovered himself aud replied c my lord 1 was in hopes that your serene countenance would shine some time yet on this court therefore i deferred this dish  for with what dish ut the queen of pies should the cook honour the day of your departure v  indeed said the duke laughing  i suppose then you wish to wait for the day of my death to honour me for you have never yet sent it up to me but think of another dish to celebrate the departure for tomorrow that pie must be on the table m  your pleasure shall be done my lord replied the dwarf and retired but he went away uneasy for the day of his disgrace and misfortune had come he did not know now to prepare this pie isle went therefore to his chamber and wept over his fate when the goose mimi who was allowed to walk about came up and inquired the cause of his grief when she heard of the pie  dry your tears said she  this dish came often to my fathers tible and i know pretty well what is necessary for it you have only to take such and such things in certain quantities and should these not be all that are really necessary i trust that the taste of these gentlemen is not sulhciently refined to discover the deficiency  at these words the dwarf danced with joy blessed the day on which he had purchased the goose and set about making this queen of pies he first made a trial in miniature and lo the flavour was exquisite and the mastercook to whom he gave the small pie to taste praised once more his great skill l the following day he prepared the pie un a larger scale and after having garnished it with flowers sent it hot as it came from the oven to table after which he dressed in his best and went to the dining hall on entering he found the steward engaged in carving the pie and presentnig it on silver dishes to the duke and his guest the duke swallowed a large piece turned his eyes upward saying  ha  ha ha  jutlv is this called the queen of pies  but my dwarf is also a king of cooks is it not so my friend   his guest took a small morsel tasted it carefully and smiled somewhat scornfully and mysteriously the thing is made pretty well replied he pushing his plate away but it is not quite the soueraine as i well imagined  at this the duke frowned with indignation and turned red saying  you hound of a dwarf how dare you do this to your lord i i will have your big head cut off as a punishment for your bad cooking    1     ah my lord said tfte duart tremnung  xor neaveu s sake have compassion on me  i have made that dish indeed according to the proper receipt and am sure that nothing is wanting   tis a lie you knave replied the duke giving him a kick  tis a lie else my guest would not say there was something wanting i will have you yourself cut up and baked in a pie   have compassion on me  exclaimed the dwarf shuffling on his knees up to the prince and clasping his feet  tell me what is wanting to this pie and why it does not suit your palate  let me not die for a handful of meat or flour   this will not avail you my good nose replied the prince laughing  even yesterday i thought you would not be able to make this dish as well as my cook know there is wanting a herb called sneezewithpleasure which is not even known in this country without it this pie is insipid and your master will never eat it in such perfection as i do  at this the duke flew into a rage and cried with flashing eyes   i will eat it in perfection yet for i wear by my princely honour that by toinoirou i will either have the pie set before you such as you desire it or the head of this fellow shall he spiked on the gate of my palace go you hound i give vou once more twentyfour hours cried the duke now the herb wanted is the very herb that will disenchant the dwarf and being

and a wilder humour about the merry and disreputable miss di pradella with her passion for embroidered pillowslips of course daniel chaucer is always very childlike and one of the habits of childhood is to chuckle over jokes that it cannot explain so the savage satire with which he cudgels countess macdonald a horrible picture of what a wicked fabian would be like is sometimes incomprehensible the same combination of wit and obscurity that made one feel the force of the satire one was not permitted to understand was observable in high germany but the book as a whole is a complete reaction against daniel chaucers earlier manner one can remember the time when daniel chaucer committed the sin of henry james in every supersubtle sentence but that influence has gone the last pages which contain mrs petts description of the death of sergius mihailovitch belong to the manner of joseph conrad the weathercock veers to many winds but it is always the same weathercock and the individuality of daniel chaucer is always precious whatever wind it follows  the new humptydumpty by daniel chaucer 6s john lane the new humptydumpty is the young king of galizia whose people have rebelled set up a republic and made it necessary for him and his mean pompous old mother to escape out of it they settle down in england very much as a certain real king and his household are settled in exile amongst us at this time and presently a little group of plotters is gathered about them scheming and intriguing to replace the dispossessed monarch on his throne it is an amazing group including an american millionaire an english lady and his lordship her dissipated husband a fatuous chauffeur a lightcomedy actress a lady of lighter reputation still a bumptious cockney journalist and for leader of them all the russian count macdonalda wholly likeable and charming character the one utter idealist and fine spirit in the sordid selfsceking shoddy company the american millionaire helps to finance the adventure with a couple of millions on the understanding that he receives valuable mining concessions the english lady aldington and her husband contribute to the treasury because they own profitable tin mines in the country that the republic is governing the count who under the tuition of the egregious cockney journalist mr pett has been an anarchist and a socialist and squandered his fortune for the good of those causes has now taken up the kings cause on pure idealistic grounds and for no possible good to himself incidentally he is hampered with a very jealous wife the daughter of a london shopkeeper a girl he had married in his socialistic days he is further hampered by the american millionaires sentimental daughter falling in love with him and by falling in love himself with the unhappily married lady aldington wnrhich opens the door to some biting satire on our divorce laws as the whole story opens it to a satiric handling of modern methods of company promotion and to an ironic presentation of the grotesque realities that underlie the outward glory and dignity of kingship the characterisation is masterly and the satire of the book especially when it is concerned with the futile personality of the exiled king or that of a certain degenerate russian grand duke or that of the great little mr pett cuts home but it is all done with so light and whimsical a touch that even when it is most biting it is irresistibly amusing there is nothing cleverer or more entertaining among the new novels than this witty and brilliant story of how all the kings financiers and motley hangerson and that one delightful idealist went to work to put humpty dumpty together again  the new hmnptydumpty fiction by daniel chaucer john lane 6s  mr daniel chaucers work has the quality of a really good champagne it exhilarates and the general effect is that of a slight but quite pleasant intoxication no novelist eludes classification so successfully other writers are grave and gay in turns but mr chaucer is grave and gay at the same time he is at once a keen observer of contemporary movements a social satirist an explorer into the strange realms of phantasy and a purveyor of honest entertainment his style is marked by a distinction that lifts it to a very high level and his dialogue is a feast of delights one may perhaps take mr chaucer halfseriouy for it seems to us that it would be as great a mistake to see too little in his story as to see too much he chronicles with a certain eager avidity the lives of wellbred people of dissolute habits for the crankconsidered purely as a typehe has a special fondness and the study of mr pett the theoretic socialist is inimitably perfect the story is concerned with a counterrevolution in the kingdom of galizia the king is living in exile a republic has been established the kinga mere boyhas acquired a little unfairly a reputation for a certain not very reprehensible licentiousness he is believed to be fond of actresses but he has friends and thesefor various reasonsare anxious to see him reestablished on the throne of his ancestors the financial aid of an american syndicate is invoked and thus the quite perfect mr dexter with his tufthunting daughter are introduced for the delight of the reader but the dominating figure of the narrative is sergius mihailovitch macdonald round whom the other characters revolve like stars in the planetary system macdonald is indeed mr chaucers supreme achievement in portraiture and the curious passion of the count for lady aldington provides a love interest which is less absorbing than the various ramifications of that  dark forestto adopt mr chaucers beloved metaphorthe heart of macdonald himself the conclusion of the story is as artistically satisfactory as it is somehow unexpected all readers of  the new humptydumpty  will await not without impatience mr chaucers next novel we wonder by the way who mr chaucer is,lishfiction_contra

B9059,['9433186'],  1 kissing the rod a novel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth novel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends

william gifford palgrave 2 vols macmillan  co it is a rare thing to have two works so important on cognate subjects issued on the same day and by the same publishing firm as lady gordons letters and mr palgraves narrative since lane produced his modern egyptians we have had no such pleasant addition to our knowledge of arab life on the middle nile as these letters from egypt by lady duff gordon offer a few bits from these pictures have already appeared in the athencwm kindly transcribed for our use by the eminent lady to whom they were addressed but let us hasten to add in fear of misunderstanding that the volume is a new book as fresh in interest as it is sweet and bright in style lady gordon has lived with the arabs and become bint el beleda daughter of the country the present visit to the nile was not her first bhe stayed her year and a half upon the river and its banks and she has friends and kinsmen in important posts in egypt this should be said by way of warrant that her stories of the people and their ways of living and thinking are not dropped by her in either ignorance or sport these stories will be rather surprising to people who have been taught to regard the arabs as dirty and lazy hareem life as a sink of iniquity and islam as a foul and corrupting creed a pious old scotch friend who called on lady gordon at eluksur told her in the course of a long and orthodox wail on the state of egypt that there was some truth certainly in the moslem faith but that this portion of truth was the work of satan whose  toeenisters the ulema were lady gordon adds that as satan would have it the people were just then reading the koran in the hall and that one of them who was giving a feast that day at his own expense came in at the instant and gtitely offered the scotch critic a dish of sweets he is very fond of telling these little anecdotes in favour of arab toleration of her arab teacher sheikh yoosuf a teacher of the law a man whom the jews would have called a rabbi a masterwe grow in these letters to be fond as of a familiar friend and this no less on account of his childlike wisdom and insight as to moral and spiritual things than for nis gentleness of manner and his purity of heart sheikh yoosuf is indeed woefully ignorant of many things he never in his life wore gloves ate with a fork or tasted pale ale he has but a vague notion of the dignities and uses of a bishop and never heard of a public meeting in his life yet in lady gordons opinion this untutored son of the desert has a good deal of natural piety and of acquired toleration he abstains from tobacco and preaches to his neighbours once a weekon friday he reads and believes in the holy books including the new testament which last he says is a true book only the bad christians have perverted its sense in many ways when it was proposed to send a young boy to england the simple sheikh desired lady gordon to read the gospels with the boy before he left egypt so that he might understand them truly and not fall into peril of his soul through the inventions of vulgar and bad people yoosuf has some ideas which lady gordon quotes with high approval  i was talking the other day with yoosuf about people trying to make converts and i uttered that eternal betise  oh they mean well true 0 lady perhaps they do mean well but god says in the noble koran that he who injures or torments those christians whose conduct is not evil merely on account of religion shall never smell the fragrance of the garden paradise now when men begin to want to make others change their faith it is extremely hard for them not to injure or torment them and therefore i think it better to abstain altogether and to wish rather to see a christian a good christian and a muslim a good muslim after telling a story in which a doctor of the law had likened her to a good moslem lady gordon sums up in a few words her observations on the religious change now passing over islam i believe that a great change is taking place among the ulema that islam is ceasing to be a mere partyflag just as occurred with christianity and that all the moral part is being more and more dwelled on my great aliin also said i had practised the precepts of the koran and then laughed and said i suppose i ought to say the gospel but what matters it the truth el hakk is one whether spoken by our lord eesa or by our lord mohammad to like the arabs as lady gordon likes them you must not only live among them but have some natural genius for the study of their manners very particular persons are not likely to do it to pious british females in general the egyptian fellaheen will always present themselves as poor things french women do not easily get used to them rachel for her sins went up the nile and stayed three months in the very village occupied by our countrywoman  she hated it so that on embarking to leave she turned back and spat on the ground and cursed the place inhabited by such savages we can well believe it and yet sheikh yoosuf lived there as well as mustapha the consular agent who keeps a clerk and lends his horses and gives dinners and receives no pay what is a man like yoosuf to mdlle lecouvreur french women says lady gordon generally do not like the arabs who they say are not at all galants as i write this i laugh to think of gcuanterie and arab in one sentence and glance at my brother yoosuf who is sleeping on a mat quite overcome with the simoom which is blowing and the fast which he is keeping today as the eve of the eed elkebir as an arab dare not look into a womans face unless she is his wife or slave it is quite easy to see how a french actress should find him wanting in gallantry eating with the hands instead of with knives and forks is another great trial of manners in which the poor arab comes off badly in the opinion of most europeans a great deal can be said in favour of eating with the fingers and lady gordon says she has come to prefer food with fingersarab fingers as she explains  which are washed fifty times a day we have ourselves been on the nile and have tented in the desert and we can say thus much in confirmation of our authors experience that we have no objection to eating with fingersfor arabs for ourselves we prefer knives and forks more than once we tried to dip into a common dish of stewed olives mutton and lentils but the english feeling in favour of forks was too strong and after two or three trials we gave up the attempt to conquer this particular prejudice but then our opportunities were limited we had not been a year and a half in an arab village and learnt like lady gordon to live upon nothing like every one who dwells in the east lady gordon sees how wonderfully the daily life of sheikhs and peasants explains the holy scriptures and she has many a sly little laugh in her letters over the ignorance of men who ought to do better things for example she says in one placei received an illustrated news with a print of a ridiculous rebekah at the well from a picture by hilton with regard to eastern subjects two courses are opento paint like mediaeval painters white people in european clothes or to come and see mawkish misses in fancy dress are not benat elarab like rebekah nor would a respectable man go on his knees like an old fool before the girl he was asking in marriage for the son of his master of all comical things though victor hugos  orientales is the funniest elephants at smyrna whynot at paris and london quelle couleur locale sheikh yoosuf had a good laugh over hiltons rebekah and the camels more like pigs as to their heads he said we must have strange ideas of the booka of towrt the pentateuch in europe and sheikh yoosuf is assuredly right about our strange notions of the pentateuch of all the great questions which agitate human beings that of the relations of man to woman is beyond compare the most complex and attractive and it is also that in which eastern life affords us an experience wholly unlike our own in egypt as in every part of islam the man has rights which europe denies to him and the woman has rights which europe denies to her the chief of these rights are that the man can marry four wives and buy as many slaves for concubines as his purse will permit and that the woman has a perfect claim to maintenance and to all her powers as a citizen and a human being in europe where men have made the laws and the public opinion we think a great deal of the fact of polygamy and in many of our thoughts the whole system of life in tne east appears to turn upon this domestic arrangement as the cardinal fact it may be that it does so turn many male voices assure us of it but then we know that it is extremely hard for a man who merely stays in cairo or sails up the nile to learn anything trustworthy about the hareem only a woman can enter that secret corner of a moslems home and few english women have had the opportunities of seeing and hearing of these strange matters for themselves miss martineau speaks very strongly against hareem life but then miss martineau is neither a mother nor a wife and her knowledge of conjugal relations is necessarily slight and secondhand it is doubtful whether any english matron would consider an old maid a fair judge of married life even in our own country on this delicate topic lady gordon is particularly full and explicit we believe her letters were written to her mother and her daughter ladies with whom she had no reason to be reserved on such points and whether her observations on arab domestic life should prove to be final or otherwise the matter which she presents is curious and startling to begin with unlike miss martineau she is enamoured of oriental female charms if i can get hold of a handsome fellaheh here i will get her photographed to show you in europe what a womans breast can be for i never knew it before i came here it is the most beautiful thing in the world and gloriously independent of stays or any support lady gordon is so well known in society as a woman of beautiful race that her compliment to the egyptian peasant may be taken at its highest value without injustice now let us descend at once on the domestic carpet says ladygordon thereare a good many things about bareena hm which i am barbarian enough to think extretaely good and rational i heard from an earwitaeae a conversation which passed between an old turk of cairo and a yoong englishman who politely chaffed him about muslim license upon thu the venerable turk who had been in europe asked toms questions ae to the nature and number of the englishman relations to women which the latter was wholly unable to answer  well young man said the turk  i am old and was

the word has acquired another meaning it was a very difficult question for the european to answer on another occasion we read  i heard a curious illustration of arab manners today i met hasan the janissary ofthe american consulate a very resjhjctable good man he told me he had married another wife since last year i asked what for it waa the widow of his brother who had always lived in the same house with him like one family and who died leaving two boys she is neither young nor handsome but he considered it his duty to provide for her aud the children and not let her marry a stranger so yon so that polygamy is not always sensual indulgence  and a roan may thus practice greater selfsacrifice than by talking sentiment about deceased wives sisters i said laughing to omar as we went on that i did not think the two wives sounded very comfortable  oh no not comfortable at all for the man but he take care of the woman that is what is proper that is the good muslim this feeling says lady gordon is universal in egypt in noticing a few days ago the mohammedan laws we spoke of the husbands obligation to maintain his wife at all costs lady gordon tells a little story in point  a man married at alexandria and took home the daily provisionn for the first week after that he neglected it for two days and came home with a lemon in his hand he asked for some dinner and his wife placed the stool and the tray and the washingbasin and napkin and on the tray the lemon cut in half well and the dinner  dinneryou want dinner where from what man are you to want women when you dont keep them i am going now to the kamee to be divorced from you  and she did the min must provide all necessaries for his hareem and if she bas money or earn any she spends it in dress if she makes him a skull cap or a handkerchief he must pay for her work all is not roses for these eastern tyrantsnot to speak of the unbridled licence of tongue allowed to women and children zeyneb hectors omar and i cant persuade him to check her  how i say anything to it that one child omar is a perfect treasury of unconscious fun and knowledge he is an index to egyptian life here to wit is a curious trait in europe men may speak to each other of many delicate things which they could not speak to a woman about in egypt it is the other way a man may speak to a woman not his wife of things which it would be considered indecorous for him to mention to a man tims when seleem effendi told lady gordon about his purchase of a young black slave for his hareem omar said it is proper to say such things to a lady but wrong to mention them before men again omar gave lady gordon a very particular account of his own marriage  i intimated she writes that english people were not accustomed to some words he used and might be shocked upon which he said  of course i not speak my hareem to english gentleman but to good lady can speak it from omar indeed we get many a curious glimpse into this unknown hareem life  he tells me his domestic affairs and talks about though women of his family whioh he would not do to a maa he refused to speak to his brother a very grand dragoman who was with the prince of wales this man came op to us in the hotel at cairo and addressed omar who turned his back on him i asked the reason and omar told me how bis brother had a wife an old wifebeen with him long time very good wife she had had three children all dead all at once the dragoman who is much older than omar declared he would divorce her and marry a yoong woman omar said  no dont do that keep her in your house as head of your household and take one of your two black slavegirls as your hareem but the other insisted and married a young turkish wife whereupon omar took his poor old sisterinlaw to live with him and his own young wife and cut his grand brother dead see how characteristic the urging his brother to take the young slavegirl  as his hareem like a respectable man that would have been all right but what he did was not good ill trouble you as mrsused to say to settle these questions to every ones satisfaction omars account of the household of his other brother a confectioner with two wives was very curious he and his wife aad they all live together one ofthe brothers wives has six children three sleep with their own mother and three with their other mother and all is quite harmonious it is certainly very odd and quite unlike what english people fancy polygamy must be until we came to govern india and to study the mohammedan law most of us imagined that an oriental woman was a slavea slave to a brutal and voluptuous tyrantwho found a ready punishment for her infidelities in the bowstring or the rack we never dreamed that an arab wife had rights we never conceived the idea of an oriental being compassionate towards the weaker sex and were probably unacquainted with the moslem duty of  concealing evil once on a time lady gordon surprised her pious servant into the avowal of a doctrine that will undoubtedly shock every  wellregulated mind  it is impossible to conceive how startling it is to a christian to hear the rules of morality applied with perfect impartiality to both sexes and to hear arabs who know our manners say that europeans are  hard upon their women and do not fear god and conceal their offences i asked omar who is very correct in his notions whether if he saw his brothers wife do anything wrong he would tell her husband nb he cant endure her  certainly not he said  i must cover her with my cloak of course the offence of unchasteness is very great but though arab holds it to be equally great in man and in woman and his instinct revolts gainst the terrible punishment sometimes inflicted on the weaker party to this sin mr palgraves narrative of a years journey through central and eastern arabia is a much longer and graver work than lady gordons  letters having a different kind of interest for its readers and indeed appealing to a different class of readers altogether lady gordons is a book for everybody a volume for the summer lawn for the seaside and the easychair an idleness a delight and a pastime mr palgrave addresses the geographer and the politician who must take to him map in hand and with all that has been written on arabia fresh in his mind he is expected to know everything about places the very names of which are not to be found in ordinary maps of the countrymaan for example mr palgraves point of departure the  narrative in truth is a piece of solid reading both in its matter and its type in the east a man travels at a great disadvantage compared to a woman a woman may enter an arab nouseholda man may not more than half the worldand by far the most fascinating portion of itis therefore cut off absolutely from masculine observation a man can see the outsides of things in towns the walks the public gardens the streets the caravanserais and in the country the fields wells mountains sand plains and so forth but of the domestic life he can study absolutely nothing still even in matters open to mans observation there is a great deal yet for ns to learn in the arabian peninsulageography ethnologytopography and agriculture and we will say very confidently that in these mattera of public knowledge no work of recent yean has added so much to the stock of general information about arabia as mr palgraves  narrative mr palgrave has gone over a new route from the dead sea to the persian gulf and contrary to the expectation of most persons he has found that instead of a magnificent waste peopled only by a few nomadic shammar and anezi bedouins it is in a great measure a settled country sprinkled with towns and villages having resident kings and sheikhs with a fixed policy a peaceful commerce ana extending alliances in fact the result of his journey is to give us a new map of arabia more than a new map indeed he gives us unlike lady gordon who has been studying arab life in its domestic as well as in its publio aspects he thinks poorly of his oriental friends and he is especially fierce upon their religious practices mr palgrave asks his reader to dismiss all his romantic and excited notions about bedouin freedom arabic culture and mohammedan piety these are all delusions he asserts in a thousand places the bedouins are false and brutal savages the arabs have no science never had any he says not even the moors of cordova and granada and while he maintains that the faith of islam never exercised much real influence in arabia he somewhat inconsistently as it seems to us declares that islam is one of the main causes perhaps the chief cause ofthe backward condition of arabia these views being novel to say the least we should have been glad to know a little more of the critic than he has been pleased to tell us is he free from national and sectarian bias  what were his objects in travel  how far were his disguises and misrepresentations necessary to his safety what are his religious opinions two rays of light we get upon these questions in the preface mr palgrave tells us that he was in connexion with the order of jesus and that louis napoleon paid his expenses what mysteries of purpose these two statements may be held to cover we shall not affect to guess but mr palgrave would not hate made them public unless he had desired his reader to bear them in mind with the caution implied in this reference to the circumstances under which mr palgrave travelled in arabia we may quote his opinions about the arabs the wild arab of the desert and the settled arab of the inland towns arab nationalitythus far like that ofthe historical jew or the highlanderis and always has been from the very earliest times based on the divisions of families and clans tribes as they are often called nor is the name misapplied if taken in its original sense of hereditary alliance without the additional idea of barbarism and unsettled life often annexed to it in its modern application the tribes or dans were soon by the nature of the land itself divided each and every one into two branches correlative indeed but of unequal size and importance the greater section remained as townsmen or pea sants in the districts best susceptible of culture and permanent occupation where they still kept up much of their original clannish denominations and forms though often blended and even at times obliterated by the fusion inseparable from civil and social organization the other and leaser portion devoted themselves to a pastoral life for which the desert that is about a third in extent of the arabian peninsula affords ample scope they too retained their original clannish and family demarcations but unsoftened by civilization and unblended by the links of closedrawn society so that in this point and indeed in this alone they have continued to be the faithful depositaries of primaeval arab tradition and constitute a sort of standard rule for the whole nation hence when genealogical doubts and questions of descent arise as they often do among the fixed inhabitantsor dwellers in brick to give citizens and villagers their collective arab denominationrecourse is often had to the neighbouring bedouins for a decision unattainable in the complicated records of town life whereas the living gwillym of the desert can readily explain every quartering and surcharging in every scutcheon of arab nobility but in all other respects in religion arts science and civilization these heralds of the wilds have naturally enough retrograded rather than advanced one step beyond their first condition how indeed could it be otherwise with the desert for their only teacher and camels and ostriches for fellowscholars  hence while the fixed population have added to their first stockinhand of knowledge and arts many of the new acquirements and ameliorations which the progressive law of the human mind when under favourable circumstances never fails to bring among men the bedouins have on the other hand receded to the utmost limit of barbarism possible among arabs and have at last become such as we now see them till they bear the same relation to the rest of their fellowcountrymen that a wild crab offshoot below does to the thriving and fruitladen branches above even their vaunted hospitality to strangers though it is not denied is explained away into something less than the wild virtue which it looks like in our ordinary books their openhandedness often springs more from the childish levity of the savage than from true and praiseworthy liberality of character like an infant that stretches out its small hands and opens its little mouth for whatever comes within its reach be it a guinea or a cherry and with almost equal readiness lets its new acquisition drop no sooner than grasped the bedouin is at once rapacious and profuse coveting all he sees without much distinction of its worth and lightly parting with what he has already appropriated from very incapacity to estimate or appreciate its value to give to beg or to plunder are for him correlative acts all arising in the main from the same immense ignorance of what property really is and what its importance and thus he is often soarce more entitled to commendation for the one act than liable to berious blame for the other  in a word he knows no better besides he has in general but little to offer and for thai very little he not unfrequently promises himself an ample retribution by plundering his lastnights guest when a few hours distant on his morning journey it may be added in this connexion that mr palgrave runs down not only the bedouin but his camel his ass and everything that is his against the camel he nurses an implacable hatred and our old favourite ship of the desert comes out very badly indeed from his shaping hands but the great vials of mr palgraves wrath are reserved for the bedouin upon whom and upon whose friends he has poured out all his indignation for example  the european public is deluged with accounts of arab customs arab ways arab qualities houses dresses women warriors and what not the most part from materials collected in syria mesopotamia egyptirak perhaps tunis algiers and morocco or at the best in djiddah and on the ites sea coast sometimes a romantic spirit will rnnsh scenes among the hybrid bedouins of palmyra as portraits of arab life sometimes we are invited to study arab society in a divan at gabo or aleppo such narratives however accurate they may be for the localities and raoes they dsasribe have not an equal claim to the title of correct delineations of arabs and of arab customs the case appears to me much as if the description of a backwoodsman of ohio should be given for a faithful portrait of a yorkshire farmer or the ways and doings of connaught for a sketch of norfolk life and manners syria and egypt palmyra and bagdad even less mosoul and algiers are not arabia nor are their inhabitants arabs the populations alluded to are instead a mixture of curd es turcomans syrians phoanicians armenians berbers greeks turks copts albanians chaldeeans not to mention the remnants of other and older races with a little a very little arab blood one in twenty at most and that little rediluted by local and territorial influences that all more or less speak arabic is a fact which gives them no more claim to be numbered among arabs than speaking bad english makes an englishman of a native of connaught or of texas for the popular figure of the bedouin i must add that even were he sketched as he rarely is from the genuine nomade of arabia it would be no juster to bring him forward as an example of arab life and society than to publish the pickwick papers or nicholas nickleby with scenes in high life or tales of the howards on the back these unlucky and muchtalkedof bedouins in the syrian also miscalled arabian desert are in fact only hybrids crosses between turcoman and  curdiah tribes with a small and questionable in  fusion of arab blood and that too none of the best i like a wineglass of thin claret poured into a tumbler of water in short among these races i town or bedouin we have no real authentic arabs  arabia and arabs begin south of syria and pales  tine weet of basrah and zobeyr east of kerak  and the red sea draw a line across from the top of the bed sea to the top

politician the route of his travel lay through iliad to hof hoof and kateef overland then bywater to bedaa linja sharjah orniuz sohar and mascat adventures in the desert and a storm at sea varied the journey with a dash of personal danger but the end of all was happy the traveller returned to europe by way of bagdad aleppo and the syrian coast mr palgraves journey is described with a minuteness truly arabic he seems to have listened to the coffeehouse storytellers until he has caught their manner of narrationa chief merit of which is that the story shall never end hence we have digression upon digression parenthesis within parenthesis so that nearly every page contains a reference to something already told or a promise that byandby it shall be delivered more at length the effect of such a method of storytelling may be very delightful in cairo or damascus where the sun ia fierce and the palmtree shady and a man may sit with his amber tube at his lips and dream away his hours in luxurious peace but in busy london with the pulse of life and thought electric in speed the effect of this manner of longdrawn discourse is not so acceptable the reader is always expecting to be told mr palgraves secret all the more so when such a barbarian as telal is taken into his confidence but he waits and hopes in vain the general of the jesuits and the emperor of the french keep their own whatever it may be and mr palgrave has probably made to these authorities a secret ana separate report we take what we are offered and are thankful for it but we cannot help following the train of

B6269,['4381583'],  browinlows mrs olipitants recent novel was originally published in blackwoods 3magazine but it extended over so many numbers that it was scarcely possible to form anything like a correct estimate of its qualities in its present form the story will be looked upon with much interest the impression produced by the minute characterpainting and patient fidelity of the chronicles of carlingford  being yet fresh in the recollection of most readers of fiction brownlows  will be chiefly welcomed on account of its negative virtues there is an entire absence of the melodramatic vulgar and coarse qualities which make so many modern novels offensive mrs oliphant is never affectedly cynical her characters never talk bombast and she never for a moment approaches that region of detective murder and adultery fiction with which we are familiar these are merely negative virtues but they are none the less grateful on that account when we come to the positive merits of the book we regret that they have been partially obscured by the disproportionate length of the story the simple incidents of the tale the characters and the dialogue suffer alike from a diffuseness which may have been dictated by the exigencies of magazine writing but which should never have been per mitted to disfigure a reprinted work the condensaion of these three volumes into one would have produced an admirable little story pointed and straightforward as  nina balatka  in its progression and perhaps not unworthy to be wompared with that little gem of fiction in style and treatment the skeleton of plot which is clothed by such a mass of writing as  brownlows by mrs oliphant author of  chronicles of cadgfor edinburgh blackwood these volumes offer is exceedingly simple and it is withal novel and interesting the head of the l3rowiilowv family is a solicitor in a country town to whom a certain mirs thomson leaves a fortune of fifty thousand pounids in charge for her daughter who some years before had married a common soldier and been disowned in consequence this dauglhter has not been heard of since and in the event of her not being discovered within twentyfive years from the date of the bequest the money is to revert to mr brownlow he immediately proceeds to ferret cut the missing woman but wholly fails advertisements and private inquiries are equally unavailing and in the end the existence of the woman is almost forgotten brownlow removes to a fine house outside the village which comes in the end to be called  brow nlows and here he lives in good style with his daughter sara and his son jack the twentyfive years are drawing to a close and nothing has been heard of a claimant for the fifty thousand pounds when a young man applied to mr brownlow for a situation as clerk this young man whose name is powys says his mother comes of a good family who once lived in these parts and that his father was a soldier altogether lhe gives sufficient particulars to convince mr brownlow that this young mans mother is the owner of the money the use of which he has enjoyed so long he forbears in the mean time to force a full disclosure wvhich would lave necessitated his surrender of this fortune but he engages young powys to be one of his clerks and then asks him to visit brownlows with a view to his forming a mateh with sara this young lady has philosophic views about marriage and privately declares to a friend that she does not believe in love and that she will marry any suitor whom her father recommends this she promises to mar brownlow and there is no doubt from the special favouritism which mr brownlow evinces for the penniless young clerk that she must consider the latter to be the coming man meanwhile another woman called mrs preston and her daughter come to the neighbourhood and take lodgings in a cottage which adjoins brownlows on the day of their arrival the girl falls on the snow and sprains her ankle and jack brow nlow who is passing carries her into the house subsequently he calls to see how she is falls in love with her and she with him the course of the story from this moment ought to be clear to every experienced novelreader powys falls in love with sara and is so bewildered with mr brownlows patronage that he hardly knows whether to make an avowal or not finally he comes to mr brownlow with a bundle of papers which he fancies will prove his gentle lineage and the father discovering that the young man is no relative whatever of the missing heiress quietly packs him out of the house mr brownlow anticipates no opposition to this disposal of matters from the philosophic young lady and he is therefore thunderstruck by the effect the news has upon her this scene is described with much vivid force  hush he said still smoothing her pretty hnir  we have never had many words about it it is all at an end i thought it would be a relief to you to hear  to bear what cried the girl sharply with her head averted and then to her fathers utter cansternation she withdrew as far as she could from his arm and suddenly burst into tears mr brownlow was totally taken by surprise he had not been able to read what was going on in his daughters heart he could not believe now that she understood him he put his hand upon her arm and drew her back  you mistake me my darling be said i mean that you are quite free saraquite free it was wrong of me to ask any promise from you and it was foolish of you to give it but providence thank god has settled that it is all over there is no more necessity cant you forgive me you have not suffered so much from it as i have done before i could have come to the point of sacrificing you   sacrificing e  cried sara suddenly flashing back upon him in a storm of passion and indignation her cheeks s0orching yet wet with tears her big eyes swimming  is that all you think of  you had a right to sacrifice me if you likednobody would have said a word they did it in the bible you might have cut me into little pieces if you liked but oh what right had you how dared you to make a sacrifice of him   him  cried mr browolow and he took a step back in consternation and gazed at his child who was transfigured and a different creature her cheeks blazed under her tears but she did not shrink weeping blushing wounded ashamed she still con fronted him in the strength of some new feeling of which he had never dreamed powys returns to his desk and tries to forget the temporary madness which had induced him to think of sara brownlow so matters roll on and the last day of the twentyfifth year has been reached on the morrow mr brownlow will be a rich man and he hopes by sending jack into parliament to make him forget the daughter of this poor woman pamela preston whom he has vowed to marry shortly before twelve however mrs preston rushes in calls jack and sara to witness in presence of their father that she is in time to claim the money and denounces mr brownlow as an impostor who has cheated her and her daughter and kept them out of their righits brownlow is overwhelmed with the discovery and for the moment harbours the thought of murdering this halfmad and brokendown creature whlo is come to destroy the futureof his children but sara notices this strange look on her fathers face takes the woman under her protection and makes her sleep in her bedroom for that night 3nrs preston shortly afterwards dies jack marries paniela and gets the brownlows and the money  andi zara marries powys whose claims to gentle lineage are tound to be of some value such is the thread on which mrs oliphant has strung her present sketches of character and these it must be said are in parts so full of sym pathetiz power and analysis that one all the more regrets the  spinning out  of which we have spoken sara brownlow is a charming study and the courtship of jack and ipamela preston is described with a quaint humiour and an unaffected tenderness which one does not frequently meet in novels mrs oliphant rarely uses lay figures her characters arc restricted in number and she draws from the life mr llardeastle is rather vague perhaps because he is unimportant and mrs preston is a little theatrical  but those characters on which mrs oliphant has expeuded labour bear witness to the faithfulness ot the hand which wrote the  chronicles of carling ford ivhoever reads  brownlows  through will be satisfied and grateful the misfortune is that the unnecessary copiousness of writing about insiginificant details may at first sight act as a

certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of english society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design perhaps mr thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern english aristocratic society his pictures most likely are not faultless whose are a line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation a man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation and now what is the nature of this fashionable world according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   vanity fair  pendennis  newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one the land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life mr thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that haut tonne is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of haut tonne can present us for the most part with such elements as these is the marquis of steyne a representative personage and his sister lady kew and the most noble farintosh is miss ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and lord kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman does love among these upper clwases usually signify flirtation and life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the world a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand marriage a convenient arrangement and religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like potichomanie and death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones

worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of vanity fair than themselves a doleful and depressing view of human nature surely true we have mr pendenniss mother and lady walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have mr pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model i wife and worship him the colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of mr i thackerays creations we can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement with tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample

person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not

on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to truth with a smile or a wink to fashion in the same moment  praising pilgrim and faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in nuditty fair the chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 vol i p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us there is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in the newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as the kickleburys fur instance which the times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its

regarded as a mystery under the very promising title of  a great mystery solved we have here a book destined to end the worlds suspense and to quiet all regret that the  fragment of a story so full of promise how condescending to be sure to the late mr charles dickens  could not be finished by the great man who commenced it mr gillan vase is the name of the heroic mortal who has not feared to puck up the pen fallen from the dead hand of charles dickens and to finish off his incomplete work for him courage rather than modesty would appear to be the distinguishing virtue of mr gillan vase he does not himself appear to be afflicted with any timidity about this  ambitious attempt to finish a work commenced by one of englands most illustrious writers  but since  it has been deemed advisable we presume by mr vases publishersthat he shouldnot apologise of course but let us say offer some explanation to his readers for what he aptly describes as this  audacious venture mr vase with some naivete proceeds to relate how he came to enter upon the undertaking some years ago then mr gillan vase first read the fragment of the  mystery of edwin drood grieved at the abrupt interruption of the story he waited impatiently in the hope that some one else some one of dickens many literary friends would gather up the broken threads and weave the story to its end mr vase had apparently overlooked the note affixed to the last number of  edwindrood in which the friends of mr dickens stated their belief that what the author would himself have most desired was done in placing before the reader without further note or suggestion the last pages written by him only a few short hours before his death at any rate mr gillan vase grew weary of waiting and brave man that he is began to solve the mysteryat first only for himself and for some appreciative friends but after a little while a very strange thing happened something stirred within mr gillan vase  something strangely like ambition1  i soon discovered he observes almost to my consternation that i had entered upon a road from which there is no turning back even though only the grisly hag disappointment should be in waiting at the end i had raised a monster which took possession of me body and soul for whoever takes up an authors pen however thoughtlessly is very soon not its master but its slave wc are not quite sure whether the last somewhat alarming statement is to be taken as applying to the pen of authorship generally or whether it applies to the special case of picking up other peoples pens and adopting so far as ones ingenuity admits of ones doing so their manner of writing but in thc latter case thc observation is singularly appropriate a distinguished american medium has we believe claimed to have received the only time and authentic conclusion to thc mystery ol edwin drood  from the spirit of charles dickens himself i mr gillan vase it will be observed does not claim to be the spokesman and slave of the spirit of dickens but only of his pen and this exactly represents his position he uses indeed the selfsame pen and dips it in the selfsame inkand forms his handwriting upon the same model but if the pen be the pen of dickens the hand which holds it and the spirit which guides the hand are those of mr gillan vaseof mr gillan yrase with a  something stirring within him strangely like ambition we are not quarrelling with mr gillan vase because of his ambition vaulting ambition is no crime in literature even when as sometimes happens  it ocrleaps itself the head and front of mr gillan vases offending is not that he has attempted to continue dickens to the best of his ability and has fa lcd but that he has with a great deal of perverted ingenuity set seriously to work to mimic dickens and in a lamentable way may besaid to have succeeded it is the reverse of the old fairy vale when straw was spun into gold mr vase has indeed gathered up in his hand the broken threads of th story but these threads of pure gold have magically and imperceptibly become transformed by his touch int common straw and the worst of the matter is that it is extremely difficult to realise afterwards that they ever were threads of gold honest and eccentric mr grewgious is made to insist so frequently upon his angularity and to smooth his head with such wearisome persistency and to deny his susceptibility to anything like sentiment being so patently open to sentiment all the time that at length he becomes not only a little like a hypocrite but even a good deal like a bore bright openhearted mr crisparkle in though same way makes his open heart a weariness to the spirit stately miss twinkelton quite descends from her dignified but gracious pedestal and becomes a vulgar and spiteful old maid setting her cap at every stray bae h dor she may chance to meet mrs crisparkle the pretty od luna shepherdess becomes such an artificial china shepherdess that it would be a great consolation if she would only get broken and put upon one side aneldurdles eventhe incom irable durdles becomes simply a very illmannered stone un son addie ted to bad language when in his cups and the strange the fatal part of the business is that all this mischief is done without any glaring departure from the style and plan of the original on the contrary such constant care and watchfulness have been observed to make the different personages of the story act up to their several characters they an so laborously themselves and insist so upon making us remark that they have lost none of their idiosyncrasies and peculiarities in passing out of the hands of their creator charles dickens into those of their showman mr gillan vase that our distaste towards them in their last state semiehow spreads back to them in their first and wc are afraid that no one who has been sufficiently unfortunate to read a great mystery solved will ever again be able to revert with the same pleasure to the mystery of edwin drood it docs not appear tonnes that a writer who constitutes himself thecontinuator of to use his own expression  one of tin most illustrious of englands writers has the smallest claim to any indulgence wo have not therefore hesitated to express our opinion that a great mystery solved might much more appropriately be entitled a great work spoiled at the same time we do not mean to deny that mr gillan vase has displayed a good deal of ingenuity in handling an extremely complicated plot and in working out from it a sufficiently probable conclusion fleas are not lobsters and ingnuity is not genius and mr gillan vase is not charles dikens nevertheless epiite enough cleverness has been thmwn away upon this untoward venture to provo that the author if he will

indies for the purpose of entering on the duties in question that johnson died in common with the rest of her family aphra settled in surinam where her adventurous career began as though she had not names enoughand most if not all of the variants assigned her were accepted and employed by herself  the appellation astrea bestowed upon her by her admiring contemporaries was advanced by langbaine as her real name it was not until the 6th of september 1884 that the accuracy of the accepted biographies was called seriously into question in the athenaum of that date appeared a letter from mr edmund

escaping with her life the secret whioh in the course of her flirtations she had surprised of the intention of the dutch to sail up the thames and burn the english ships in the medway was derided at court her applications for a payment she had well earned were refused she appears to have been lodged in gaol for debt and found herself compelled to seek a living by her pen the tragedies with which she approached the stage were unsuccessful and it was not until she produced comedy after comedy licentious in intrigue and coarse in dialogue but possessed of a certain measure of vivacity and spirit that she won recognition during a literary career which lasted for something under a quarter of a century she acquired the intimacy of dryden killigrew tate otway and the wits of the day and when in 1689 she died owing to the ignorance of her physician she found a restingplace in poets corner westminster abbey where on a slab of marble her name may still be read the irony of fate thus pursued her to the end and the woman whose name not too justly has become a byword in such state doth lie as has been vainly demanded for more than one of the greatest poets of following centuries it was at surinam that aphra made the acquaintance of oroonoko the african prince whose adventures she narrates in the bestknown of her romances how much of the story she tells is fact and how much fiction is as doubtful as are most other things connected with her life and proceedings the novelist was credited by her contemporaries with intimate and dishonouring relations with her hero a gratuitous and wildly improbable suspicion for never surely did an amorous woman depict a successful rival in colours so bright as those bestowed upon imoinda the inspirer of oroonokos passion and the sharer in his fate seven years after mrs benns death the story of oroonoko was dramatised by thomas southerne who afterwards expressed his regret at having coupled so touching a theme with comic scenes of extreme coarseness southernes tragedy was thrice amended or imitated a pale and colourless rendering by dr hawkesworth being lukewarmly defended by jdr johnson from one or other of these dramatisations the popular idea if such can be said to exist of oroonoko is drawn the fable itselfwe leave the reader to accept the word in whichsoever sense it commends itself to himbelongs wholly to mrs behn and to her is due the credit of finding in a fugitive african slave a subject for romance at a period when the choice by shakespeare of a moor as a hero was being seriously rebuked that there is a basis of fact in the story of  oroonoko or the royal slave will not be seriously disputed the narrator claims to have been an eyewitness of the deeds she recounts and asserts  what i could not be witness of i received from the mouth of the chief actor in this history the hero himself who gave us the whole transactions of his youth she states also that she had had presented to her a set of feathers such as were converted into dresses adding what is credible enough that she gave them to the kings theatre  it was the dress of the indian queen infinitely admired by persons of quality and was inimitable a costume of the sort is characteristic it might be supposed of the aborigines of the island rather than of the african importations with whom they had nothing in common except experience of european treachery cruelty and deceit it is the indians of whom mrs behn speaks rather than africans when she says that such is their respect for truth and ignorance of falsehood that when the english governor who had pledged himself to meet them failed either to come or to send a message they mourned and fasted for the death which alone could as they assumed have caused his absence oroonoko himself is described as a black a perfect ebony or polished jet with eyes  the most awful that could be seen a nose  rising and roman and a mouth firmly shaped and with no signs of the thick lips of the negro his sentimental adventures may be assumed to be in part imaginative but his death in circumstances of revolting cruelty after heading a servile revolt has nothing that offends probability mrs behn is then to be credited with being among the first to denounce the horrors and atrocities of slavery had the whole of her novels been as simple and direct as this story they would have taken a permanent place in literature the more serious of them are however extravagant in action and commonplace in style most of them bear traces of foreignprobably spanishinfluences and some must be accepted as

B729,['8771387'],  norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale barton cathcart is the son of a farmer who had from a small beginning worked his way to a position of independence and comparative wealth and from this father barton inherits the strong new england

various persons who have little indeed to do with j the furtherance of the plot but not one of whom we would 1 be willing to have left out they are as the seasoning to i the dish barton goes to college without any disclosure of 1 his feelings for rose returning to the village only for occa  sional vacations meanwhile she grows up to womanhood i her character formed partly by her fatheran idealist j owning a sympathy with all things animate and inanimate and partly by her fathers housekeeper agate bisselin  every respect the counterpart of miss ophelia in  uncle 1 toms cabin the same conscientiousness the same in  dustry and the same untiring energy which marked that i indefatigable lady rose under this training became as  near perfection as is possible for mortals barton finally

sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a gentleman wants a decorous faith a good plain sensible worship and then with a good conscience he turns to the enjoyment of life leaving to the deity andexcuse meto the yankees the management of unfathomable mysteries he makes little progress with rose but the arrows aimed for her find their mark in alice cathcart and she learns to love the bright young southerner an accident which happened while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely broken in upon by the news of the bombardment of fort sumter and we have an animated description of the rapidity with which the war summons was answered our friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a

be said for our al fresco repast you know what form we like that grace to take be it as brief as you will but it must be in verse we are not in sicily he said  nor am i theocritus but veronica asked me the other day if i could give her some idea of the short pastoral idylls written two thousand years ago which not all of us can read but of which all of us have heard i am not so presumptuous as to suppose i have succeeded in responding adequately to her wish but perhaps our almost sicilian surroundings and the indulgent temper of the hour may confer on the attempt something of the appropriateness it would otherwise lack the latter speaker of formal antiquated sentences was the poet and his audience consisted of veronica his wife lamia a young unmarried woman and the chronicler of the party who figures throughout as i  four personages who will be familiar to readers of the garden that i love and in veronicas garden and we have placed this passage at the head of our article because it is typical of the authors curiously oldfashioned manner of recording conversationsa mixture of the leading article and mrs opie why he should thus put back the clock we have no conception we cannot believe that there are readers today who favour in dialogue a return to the diffuse and artificial periods of our forefathers crispness and terseness have surely proved their case yet here is mr austin the titular head of english letters clothing his sentiments in copious and uncomfortable brocades that we hoped had long since been motheaten beyond recovery it is peculiarly odd because in the lyrics which are scattered through this volume mr austin keeps luminously and directly to the point indeed so careless is much of though prose so fluent and haphazard and journalistic that one cannot help feeling the author has considered it of inferior importance to the verses  they are the jewels the prose is merely the setting which does not really matter may easily have been his contention hence such an ugly phrase as  the purchaser alone gets any delectation out of them   such tautology as  a kindred need of this kind  and the verbosity of the whole everyone knows that it is more facile to be verbose than succinct we do not mean to say that lamias winter quarters is actually badwe do not consider that it isbut its lack of distinction in workmanship and the total absence of any vivacity any animating spirit any gaiety makes its triviality too noticeable such booksthe record of a family partys sojourn in a villa of tuscany must necessarily deal with trivial matters because domestic details are always trivial and the conversation of travelling companions usually so but there is a method of so treating the trivial that the result is literature mr austin has however not mastered it lamias winterquarters has all the machinery of a charming book and is yet without charm the poet is a bore he is selfconscious and pontifical he is often a prig veronica is dull and a near relative of mrs grundy lamia is meant to be a revelation of beauty and winsomeness but instead she has the skittishness of a governess at a picnic she is arch in the early victorian way she would tap you with her fan she gives the impression that she might even say with a giggle you naughty man and surely mr austin never intended that she tells the chronicler that he will never understand women she asks will it be very unromantic to seem hungry  adding  because if it wouldas i should not like to hurt anyones feelingsi can sat the edge of appetite with bare imagination of a feast or at most with the unsubstantial pageant of a mandarin orange subsequently it may be mentioned the party indulged in the pleasant and perfectly safe satisfaction of their appetite now such things as these we hold are not matter for a book they are only in place in an essay entitled our winter in tuscany read before a provincial essay society after subtracting these passages there is still a quantity of serious disquisition on a number of conversational topics but mr austin has not the art or the genius for taking pains to make it good reading the authors verse however is in pleasant contrast to his prose it has brightness and clarity as of old he shows too great facility in dropping into mere rhymed catalogues of natural phenomena but as these lists are lists of flowers and birds and beasts which are associated in our minds with rural contentment we like them they bring fragrant and delectable memories thus  goodnight now dwindle wan and low the embers of the afterglow and slowly over leaf and lawn is twilights dewy curtain drawn the slouching vixen leaves her lair and prowling sniffs the telltale air the frogs croak louder in the dyke and all the trees

with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many

publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of

prepared to demand his works at the circulating library if he is so fortunate as to please the popular taste  there are critics major and minor anxious to shine in reflected glory by being first in the field to discover great merit or even great promise and while the standard of the best publishing houses is high a novel must be very bad indeed not to find acceptance at the hands of one of those firms that seem to exist only for the purpose of purveying indifferent fiction it is not to be wondered at therefore that innumerable men women aye and those who are little more than children rush if not always into print at least into the production of manuscript yet while so much that is written and published is unworthy of notice it is nevertheless a fact that there has not been a period in the history of english letters when the average merit of novels was so high as it is now indeed it is not too much to say that if a reader knows   the way up by mi p willcocks 6s john lane how to pick his fiction he can find enough really good books in that branch of literature issued every year to occupy all his leisure he will not find a mir strudge a  kings mirror or a  beloved vagabond  at each dip

please the critical as wvell as the uncritical reader there was a welltold story in each book and admirable characterdrawving in both praise could also be given to a man of genius though this work was not so convincing as its predecessors notwithstanding it showed a marked improvement in technique in  tle way up  miss willcocks has taken a broader canvas than she has before used upon which to paint her picture and up to a certain point in the story it is the best work she has ever done we feel her absolute mastery of the story and of the characters up to that point the point where she brings her heroine to london it would appear that the author has no inside knowledge of stageland wherein the heroine deports herself during the last chapters and the descriptions of the theatrical characters and of the theatrical atmosphere are far removed from life all that part is unreal this is to be deplored because of the great merit of the earlier part of the story the characterisation is particularly good michael strode the hero is especially wellconceived as a young man he sacrifices fortune without a pang in order to have opportunities to study the lot of the workman by himself labouring in a factory as  a hand  and as a middleaged man he is still filled with enthusiasm to improve the condition of the class whose interests he had made his own though he has married a wealthy wife he insists on living in a small house in the workmens quarter and it is his one ambition to make over the factory he owns acquired with his wifes money to the workmen to run for their own benefit he is so absorbed in his calculations and in his theories that he alienates the wife who was devoted to him and never attracts the only child of the marriage the wife too is happily depicted a pleasureloving minx whose love of gaiety and society is long held in check by her affection for her husband but the greatest character is michael strodes mother mrs strode is a figure that lingers in the memorya largehearted broadminded woman who loves her son and miracle of miracles in a mother sees him as he is with all his faults as well as with all his virtues she is cast in a large mould and

mrs crow es night side of nature airs crowe approaches her subject with a conviction that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and with so much faith in spiritual appearances as amounts to an admission that  there is something in it and an endeavour to treat the matter philosophically mr oilier sets himself to the task with a predetermination to negative the conclusion and with intent to disprove the assertions of those whom he terms the credulous it must be admitted that mr oilier is clever and smart and if ghosts are to be written down his pen will do it he not only collects all the established arguments against the supposed communications of the spiritual with the material world but he puts them in the most telling shape and where argument is wanting he is prompt with fun which is perhaps even more effective with the general public who prefer the pleasure of a laugh to the labour of thought now there can be no doubt that very few ghoststories will bear close examination and the fact is undeniable that a ghost never a ppears to the sceptical and healthy even the instances collected by mrs crowe are not satisfactory it is impossible for a cautious man to accept the 6xistence of ghosts as a fact upon any evideace yet adduced we do not venture a step beyond this we cannot dogmatically assert our unbelief because no plausible reason is or can be assigned why there should not be communing between the world of spirit and the world of flesh on the contrary the presumption would be not only that it is possible but probable that is to say such will be the conclusion of those who admit the extence of spirit and acknowledge a future state the only question is if it has been estbiehed as a fact and to that we must reply in the words of the scotch verdict not proven it is otherwise with dreams second eight presentiments and such like of these there is abundant evidmce as matters of fact and the difficulty lies in accounting for them by any other means than reference to agency which is usually called supernatural but which would be more properly termed abnormal because it is not a violation of any natural law but the operation of an existing law that is called into action only in certain conditions of mind and body the attempts to explain away these prophetic promptings of the soul by the easy assertion that they are accidental coincidences will not bear a moments reflection such coincidences cannot be accidental according to any known calculation of probabilities there is infinity to one against them and they occur too often and with too many persons and under circumstances too remarkable to be answered by reference to chance but what is chance  nothing more than the result of laws which we have not taken into our calculation in truth there is no such thing as chance every event is the necessary consequence of certain fixed laws and might be predicated with certainty if we had the capacity to grasp and trace them if then the coincidences in question are the result of fixed laws have we a right to assume that there is no meaning in them that the author of nature i affixed to them no purpose and that we are to treat them with disregard and contempt would it not be more philosophical to investigate them carefully with intent to ascertain if the soul have not even while in this its tenement of clay the power under certain conditions of the body to which it is linked of communicating with the spirit world and of obtaining by a kind of intuition knowledge which cannot be procured through the circumscribed media of the bodily senses and that this knowledge it is but how obtained we cannot tell which we term presentiment second sight dreams and which it perplexes us to account for because we have no memory of the circumstances under which it was obtained  it appears to us that this is the philosophical view of the question which has occupied so many pens pro and con and in this manner we should like to have seen it treated by mr ollier who has skill in writing to make philosophy popular we note as an instance of the sort of grtuitous assumption with which mr oilier has sought to explain away facts his account of the murder at dundry which was discovered by too persons having dreamed on the same night that the body was deposited in a certain well and mr oilier assumes that there can be little doubt that the general opinion among the deceaseds servants wvas that their master was murdered now this is a pure supposition and the fact was otherwise we were present at the trial and made very particular inquiry into the circumstances from the witnesses and the truth was that up to the time of finding the body in the well at the earnest entreaty of the men who had dreamed that it was concealed there not the slightest suspicion of murder had been entertained by any person in the family or out of it it was supposed that the farmer had either killed himself or died in a fit therefore it was that nobody thought it worth while to examine a dry well covered by a huge stone which it required two men to lift hence there was not in the minds of the dreamers anything that could have led their sleeping thoughts to the well besides if they had suspected murder why did not the well suggest itself to their waking thoughts when actually on the premises searching and it was before their eyes  it is at least an extraordinary fact that two persons should have chanced to have the same dream in itself a marvellous accident on the same night such combinations of accident would be more wonderful than the fact itself and more hard to believe than the explanation which we confess presents itself to our mind i as that which is the rationale of this and all  other revelations of the same kind namely that the state of mind and body which in mesmerism calls forth that faculty of perception beyond the range of the senses which we term clairvoyance exists also in certain other states of body and mind that one of the conditions under which this species of perception occurs is thati the attention should be intensely fixed upon the object that in the case under consideration there was the condition of attention fixed upon the object namely the missing farmer that in sleep the state of mind and body occurred wvhich permits of perception by other than the media of the bodily senses and then the object vas perceived by the sleepers and remembered by them as a dream it is a phenomenon every day witnessed in persons in a state of mesmerism and there is no reason why the faculty should not be developed in other states wve have little doubt indeed that when the subject comes to be investigated by a series of close observations it will be found that this faculty which is called clairvoyanee is possessed by nal of us but developed only in certain states of mind or body more frequently however than we at present ha ve any suspicion of we are not sure that many of the thoughts and much of the knowledge we possess is not obtained by means of this facultynay we are inclined to believe that all of that mysterious intelligence which we term instinct is to be traced to the same source but this is too large a subject to enter upon here for the present we close mr olliers book having derived from it much amusement and with a hope that lie will be induced to look more profoundly into the subject and employ his great abilities to its elucidation rather than to an endeavour to laugh it down the papers collected in this volume originally appeared in ainsworths m1agazine and that will account for their somewhat gossiping tone,lishfiction_contra

B1144,['8655833'],  white and black a story of the southern states new novels 3 vols hurst  blackett england has pretty well recorded her views upon slaver there are various ways of testing a mans practical faith in his own opinions no belief can get itself established until it hos had martyrs who have dared to die for it people have ventured to suffer shame ignominy and the loss of all things sooner than depart from what they believe to be right short of these extreme testimonies but still a tolerably sharp practical test of a mans sincerity in his profession of faith is his willingness to pay down an inconveniently large sum of ready money for it men may sign bills as they run up bills without realising the fact but to pay ready money is a dead lift out of a mans pocket about which there is no charming illusion except in those oldfashioned plays where mr t p cooke as a sailor on shore representing the old british navy used to take out a long purse stuffed at each end with soidisant bank notes and guineas and hand it with an inimitable heartiness saying  here messmate take this it is prizemoney taken by the timbuctoo and his virtue was enthusiastically rewarded by the whole house but when it comes to paying the consciencemoney to a gruff stoneyvisaged taxcollector who never says or feels a  thank you kindly then paying for a principle sustains a tolerably strong test for everyday wear and tear now england has done this and more than this to express her detestation and abhorrence of slavery  and england more than any other nation has that quality which jockeys call stay in a horse and without which no generous enthusiasm is worth more than a flash in the jiangood to kindle but worthless for warmth now what england bas done once she can hold on by in all its consequences without weariness or fickleness the hatred of slavery by englishmen is a thing said and done and settled we have no more enthusiasm to bestow upon it all that goes now to feed our persistence in our opposition to it we do not talk about itwe do not discuss itbut we continue to pay taxes to suppress it wherever we find it whilst doing this like britons we must enter an emphatic protest against being bored with it in our novels and books of amusement exquisite white heroines who somehow turn out to be black in the course of the story and so can legally be treated as if they were tables or chairs or dogs or horses areto be pitied and we do pity them and we have pitied them accordingly but when under the pretence of amusing us we are presented with three volumes full of abolition speeches and details of all that a delicatelynurtured and highlyeducated young lady must feel who having been brought up as an heiress and in ignorance that she has isegro blood in her veins ami whose father is a furious brute who to revenge himself on an abolitionist sells his daughter down southor to have details of all the domestic misery jealousy and cruelty which the female quadroon slaves bring to the lawful wives may be all very true  but it is a great bore to listen to a sermon on doctrines we have lived by and accepted absolutely for years  precher un converti is the deadliest infliction that human ingenuity can devise short of bodily torment white and black is a good sensible novel of the kind the arguments and illustrations are all of our own persuasion irene is a heroine who is very troublesome to her friends and who might have kept out of all the adversities and dangers which befell her if in the beginning she had listened to advice and used some common sense but as she was predestined by the author to point his moral and adorn his arguments of course she could not help it she was born to ill luck we confess to feeling great sympathy with chauncy burgoyne the fine highspirited planter who becomes converted to abolitionist views and loses his life in their defence the story is as well done as a story of the kind can be but we protest against being dragged through details ofthe evils of slavery from brutal floggings to more brutal love besides which our sympathy for irene is entirely destroyed by the last pagi in the book which casts a doubt on her ever having been good for anything it may be that death has already removed the bonds of the young american girl it may be that she still lins degradtd brokenhearted we can only feel that if she could live degraded after allhehad known and feltand the sacrifices of noble lives that had been made for her she deserved her fate the slavequestion is avenging iself fearfully at this moment in america the halfhearted north is trying to go two ways at once in regard to slavery it wants all the credit of repudiation and all the convenience of cottongrowing slaves freed by othrs it degrades men of colour and makes their condition to the utmost generation that of pariahs pretends to afford them liberty whilst it insults them as human beings has the north dared to accept its own principles and act mi them  has it dared even to right for its belief in the right of slaves to freedom i and fighting for a point is the very easiest and most primitive form of faith in conclusion we beg to enter our own protest against antislavery literature the perverseness of human nature is great and a few more books like uncle toms cabin and  white and black would go far towards turning the current in favour of the masters instead of the slaves,lishfiction_contra
B8740,['4358623'],  the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the author succeeded in the delineation  the queens manes a romauce of holyrood by g j whyte mielvle two tols parker so  bourn of historical character on the contrary the representatiobs which appear on his canvas are daubs or caricatures the wise and politic rtandolpha worthy ambassador even for queen elizabethbecomies a conceited dancingmaster the character of bothwell has been borrowed from the pretentious doggerel which mvr aytoun published some years ago under the name of a poem the borderer is delineated as from the first the unselfish lover of his queen  anl the brutality and cowardice which he displayed when he hat won the object of this pure devotion are glossed over in grandiloquent and meaningless sentences such as these 1the nman who would once have shed his hearts blood freely to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work there is nothing in the booknot even incident instead of the usual huntingfield with its impossible leaps we have a hawkingparty on the links of saint andrews composed of the queen and john knox than which we never read of anything more absurd these two volumes in short are as dull less authentic and far more lengthy than any record of the same period they have nothing of

aylor  co the study of the english language has of late received more attention and been pursued in a more philosophical spirit than formerly englishmen are beginning to feel the inconsistency of knowing less about the theory of their own tongue than of that of any other the conviction is gaining ground that the english language if not so scientific as the greek or the german may be made almost as valuable a means of intellectual culture in the hands of a competent instructor to acquire a critical knowledge of english the several elements of which it is composed the relative proportions of each the changes that they have undergone and the way in which they were at first introduced and have since amalgamated together demands a good deal of patient investigation add to this a thorough comprehension and ready command of all the terms of the language and it will at once be evident that no englishman can be really master of his language without having gone through a course of study beneficial as a discipline of thc mind and  fraught with information which a due regard j to national feeling must make him anxious to  receive the deficiency of inflections the numerous anomalies and the other imperfections which may be considered drawbacks to our tongue as a means of education are more than counterbalanced by thc fact of its being our tongue and spreading over so vast a portion of the inhabited world no man has done more than dr latham to place the study of english on its proper footing by his philosophical treatment of it he lins raised it to the dignity which it deservesand shown that while an essential in the earliest education of children it is not unworthy to hold a high place in college pursuits his present work is a sort of medium between his large and school grammars it is rendered much more interesting as well as more useful to a student than the school grammar by containing not merely a greater number of facts but also a more copious discussion of principles nnd a fuller explanation of though origin and reasons of particular usages on though other hand it is less abstruse and more practical than the large work on the english languageit begins with an account ofthe  general ethnological relations ofthe english language followed by a  history and analysis of thc english language this portion of the volume contains much historical and ethnological information it also describes the leading characteristics of the tongue at different periods and points out some of the tendencies of the present agc then folio about fifty pages on  sounds letters pronunciation spelling in which we find a complete list of all the simple sounds with their various combinationssome excellent remarks on the alphabet its history deficiencies and redundancies  the laws which regulate the changes of letters in different connexions and the reasons on which these laws are founded with an explanation of accent and quantity the next part treats of etymology and occupies a much larger space dr latham having previously explained the principles on which though changes ot letters rest is enabled to make the reader easily understand how the apparently anomalous forms of the plural number have originated as the possessive case is not generally understood correctly wc will cite what is here stated on the subject thu true nature rf thc ge nitrc  ins it isa ciinmon notion that t o giiive for fa tit cres is contracted from father li though  xsioit in our iryoi jesus christ his te which i nur ly a pleonastic one is the only touaduion fur tins assertion as the idea however is not only one ofthe commonet but also one of thc greatest errors in etymology though following three statements are given for the sake of contradiction to it 1 the expression the queens majesty is not capable of being reduced to thc queen his majesty 2 in the form his itself thc s has pn ciely the power that it has in fathers c now his cannot be said to arise out of at f his 3 in the slavonic lithuanic and classical tongues the genitive ends in s just as it does in english  so that even if the words father his would account for the english wori fathers it woutd not account for the sanskrit genitive pad as of a foot though zend dvghdhars of a daughter the lithuanic dugtcrs the greek 6zovtoq  though latin dentis cc the whole of this subject of etymology is handled in a most masterly manner all peculiarities of inflexion are carefully considered and if possible traced to their true origin or referred to some general law it is wonderful how few inexplicable anomalies are allowed to remain after dr latham has brought his powerful analysis to bear upon them by making free use of the anglosaxon and occasionally of other languages he gives the reader a thorough insight into all the varieties of inflexion and formation his account of the verb is highly instructive syntax and prosody are the topics discussed in the remainder of the work   the former naturally engrossing by far the greatest share of attention here too a truly philosophical spirit prevails in explaining rules of construction dr latham goes to the root of the matter and shows the dependence of the laws of language upon those of thought he decides in all disputed or doubtful cases by a reference to the idea intended to be conveyed rather than to the external form of the words used we give as an instance the following passage from the chapter on the  concord of verbs  in respect to the concord of person thc following rules will carry us through a portion of the difficulties  littlein sentences where there is but one proposition when a noun and a pronoun of different persons are in apposition the verb agrees with the first of themi your master command you not ctmmanils  your master i commands you not command  to understand the nature of the difficulty it is necessary to remember that subjects may be extremely complex as well as perfectly simple and that a complex subject may contain at one nnd the same time u noun substantive and a pronoun the keeper he the merchant c now all nounsubstantives are naturally of the third personjohn speaks the men run the commander gives orders consequently the verb is of the third person also but the pronoun with which such a nounsubstantive may be placed in apposition may be a pronoun of either person the first or second  i or thoui the commanderthou the commanderin this case the construction requires consideration with which does the verb agree with the substantive which requires a third person  or with the pronoun which requires a first or second  undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leading idea  and undoubtedly the idea which explains qualifies or defines it is the subordinate idea and undoubtedly it is the leading idea which determines thc construction of the verb we may illustrate this from the analogy of a similar construction in respect to numbera man with a horse and a gig meets me on the road here though ideas are three  nevertheless the verb is singular no addition of subordinate elements interferes with the construction that is determined by the leading idea in the expression i your master the ideas are two ti the idea expressed by 7 aud the idea ixprcsed by master neveithcless as the one only explains or defines th othu the corstnution is the sime is if the idea were hai your hiashr i is in the same condition the gmia statement is made concerning the matter and it is intended to say what he does the word  merely defines the expression by stating who the master is ofthe two expressions the latter is the awkwardest the construction however is the same for both from the analysis of the structure of complex subjects of the kind in question combined with a rule concerning the position of the subject which will soon be laid down i believe that for all single propositions the foregoing rule is absolute pulein all single propositions the verb agrees in person with the noun whether substantive or pronoun which conies first  but the expression it is i your master who command or commands you is not a single proposition it is a sentence containing two propositions 1 it is i 2 who command iou here the word master is so to say undistributed it may belong to either clause of the sentence ie the whole sentence may be divided into eitherit is i your master oryour master vho commands you this is the first point to observe the next is that the verb in the second clause command orcommands is governed not by either the personal pro noun or the substantive but by the relativeje in the particular case before us not by either or master but by who and this brings us to the following questionwith which ofthe two antecedents does the relative agree  with  or with master  this maybe answered by the two following rulespule 1when the two antecedents are in the same proposition though relative agrees with the first thus 1 it is  your master 2 who comma nd you pule 2when the two antecedents are in different propositions the relative agrees with the second thus 1 it u i 2 your matter who command you this however is not all what determines whether the two antecedents shall be in the same or in dif fcrent propositions i believe that the following rules for what may be called the distribution of the substantive antecedent will bear criticism  pule 1that when there is any natural connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the second clause thus in the expression just quoted the word master is logically connected with the word command nnd this fact makes the expression it is i your master who commands you the better of the two pule 2that when there is no natural connexion between the substantive antecedent nnd the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the first clause it is i john who command not commands you  to recapitulate the train of reasoning has been as follows1 the person of the second verb is the person of the relative 2 the person of the relative is that of one of two antecedents 3 of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the one which stands in the same proposition with itself 4 which position is determined by the connexion or want of connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative  respecting the person of thc verb in thers proposition of a complex sentence there is no doubt  your master who commands you to make haste am not is in a hurry here i am in a h wry is the first proposition who commands you to make haste the second it is not difficult to see why the construction of sentences consisting of two propositions is open to an amount of latitude which is not admissible in the construction of single propositions as long as the different parts of a complex idea are contained within the limits of a single proposition their subordinate character is easily discerned when however they amount to whole propositions they take the appearance of being independent members of the sentence with regard to the use of the subjunctive mood dr latham lays down the simple principle that whenever both conditionality and uncertainty are impliedno matter what conjunction or pronoun or other part of speech is employedthen and then only the verb must be in the subjunctive mood we have a little doubt as to the correctness of what follows whenever two or more pronouns of different persons and of the singular number follow each other disjunctively the question of concord arises  or youyou or hehe or i i believe that in these cases the rule isas follows1 whenever the words either or neither precede the pronouns the verb is in the third person either you or i is in the wrong neither you nor i is in the wrong 2 whenever the disjunctive is simple ie unaccompanied with the word either or neither the verb agrees with the first ofthe two pronouns  or he am in the wrong he or  it in the wrong thou or he art in the wrong lie or thou is in the wrong we need only say in conclusion that the english student is deeply indebted to dr latham for this valuable addition to his labours,lishfiction_contra
B5100,['6725006'],  selections from the writings of walter savage landor arranged and edited by sidney colvin  golden treasury  series macmillan a landobian anthology has long been wanted and badly to the many landor has always been more or less unapproachable and has always seemed more or less shadowy and unreal to begin with he wrote for himself and a few others and principally for himself then he wrote waywardly and unequally as well as selfishly  he published pretty much at random the bulk of his work is very urge the editions in which he appears are rare or unwieldy or both and the majority have passed him by for writers more accessible and work less freakish and more comprehensible it is probable too that even among those who inspired by natural temerity or the intemperate curiosity of the general reader have essayed his conquest and set out upon what has been described as  the adventure of the seven volumes which were seven valleys of dry bones only a few have returned victorious of course the seven volumes are a world but it is objected the world is one of a peculiar pattern abounding in antres vast and deserts idle in gaps and precipices and  manifest solutions of continuity and enveloped with sn atmosphere which ordinary lung find now too rare and now too dense and too hypnotic moreovor it is peopled chiefly with abstractions bearing noble and suggestive names but all surprisingly alike in stature and feature all more or less incapable of sustained emotion and even of logical argument all inordinately addicted to superb generalities and a kind of monumental skittishness all expressing themselves in a style whose principal characteristic is a magnificent monotony and all apparently the outcome of a theory that to be wayward is to be creative that human interest is a matter of apophthegms and oracular sentences and that axiomatic and dramatic are identical qualities and convertible terms this is the opinion of those adventurers in whom defeat has generated a sense of injury and an instinct of antagonism others less fortunate still have found landor a continent of dullness and futility have come to consider the seven volumes as so many aggregations of ennui suoh experiences are onesided and partial no doubt and considered from a certain point of view they seem worthless enough but they exist and by existing they are in some sort justified landor when all is said and done remains a writers writer and it is impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with those who hesitate to accept him for anything else the number of those who do sofrom ignorance or distaste or downright stupidity is large it is probable however that by the publication of the present volume their ranks will be thinned perceptibly and their pretensions considerably abated mr colvin is a determined landorian  but his landorism is neither pedantio nor fanatical and has in no wise debauched his humanity his judgement of landorconveyed in a prefatory note which is certainly one of the best of recent yearsis exceptionally generous both in essence and substancetoo generous i think to be final but it is nicely balanced on the whole and strikes a possible mean between the enthusiasm of disdain and the enthusiasm of admiration mr colvin takes cognizance not only of what is good and sound in his author butto a great extentof what is bad and false as well he is quite willing to recognise the fact that the author of landors unpopularity is mainly landor himself and that unique as was landors talent and notable as is landors achievement the world is not altogether to blame for the attitude of indifference it has hitherto maintained to them he claims much for the man and perceives a vast deal in the work but he admits more or less explicitly its many faultsits abruptness its inconsecutiveness its want of tact the unreality of much of it the egotism of all his object has been to produce a landor who shall be generally acceptable a landor that is to say whose blunders shall be corrected and whose better qualities alone shall be in evidence this object he has attained and eminently well planned and brilliantly executed his work is really a model of its kind it takes rank with the best anthologies in english and i cannot choose but believe that it will succeed in conquering for landor an enduring popularity and will remain the textbook of his fame and the proof of his greatness as a writer i have already referred to mr colvins preface i shall add that it contains among other notable passages an analysis of the classic and romantic methods which is comparable with heines own the book proper is divided into three parts the first  dramatic and narrative is subdivided into two sections  of specimens of landor at his best and most coherent as a writer of what it appears to be the proper thing to recognise as  drama and of landor at his best and stateliest as a storyteller and an artist in allegory in the first one is surprised and not pleasantly surprised to find extracts from the  conversation between peter the great and alexiswhich mr colvin obligingly describes as this fierce historic satireand that between fra lippo lippi and pope eugenius which contains some of the worst  comedy  ever perpetrated even by landor the rest of this section has been chosen with perfect tact as has the whole of the second of the second part which is split up into nine subdivisionsof religion of love and human nature of  literature and language and so forth the interest is purely gnomic it is admirably edited and its effect is extraordinary such a hoard of verbal jewelsof maxims cut like gems and sentences that ring like golden oracleshas not before i think been brought together the lustre it reflects upon landor considered merely as an artist in words is remarkable never before have the dignity aud beauty of his style asserted themselves to such purpose  never before has the ocular proof of his genius as a writer appeared so majestic and so overwhelming the third partof extracts  personal and autobiographicalaffects us in a different way before we have only admired here we learn to love before we have dealt with landor the writer here we are brought face to face with landor the man the effect is irresistible mr colvin has performed hi task with infinite delicacy and skill and by selection and arrangement merely has given us a better and a nobler landor than we ever knew before no doubt the landor existed but he existed in seven volumes and his aspect was vague and nebulous his editor may be said to have rescued him from himself to have made him organic and comprehensible and to have set him full in the light of that affectionate immortality which is after all his due i regret that the space at my disposal does not permit me to do more than refer in passing to one or two of what i conceive to be the weak points in mr colvins preface as i think for instance he is grievously mistaken in his estimate of landor as a dramatist and i cannot ohoose but quarrel with his attribution to landor of the gifts of heroic imagination and a sound creative faculty to many of us landors imagination i3 not only inferior in kind but limited in degree his creative faculty is limited by the reflection that its one achievement is landor his claim to consideration as a dramatio writer is negatived by the fact that poignant as are the situations with which he loved to deal he was apparently incapable of perceiving their capacitiesinasmuch as he has failed completely and logically to develop a single one of them inasmuch too as he has never once succeeded in conceiving much less in picturing such a train of conflicting emotions as any one of the complications from which he starts might be supposed to generate to many of us there is nothing greek about his dramatic work but the absence of stage directions  and that quality of  landorian abruptness whioh seems to mr colvin to excuse so many of its shortcomings is identical with a certain sort of what in mea of lesser mould is called stupidity w e henley,lishfiction_contra

either complicated 1 l or artistically worked out hugh farquhar is a highlyaccomplished gentleman who exhibits a large amount of booklearning conveyed in very clever and brilliant conversations which it would be delightful to listen to for halfanhour but dreadful to endure for any larger portion of ones natural life his conduct moreover is not at all in keeping or upon a par with that of ordinarily decent persons of his ser and the presence of the naughty italian woman under the same roof with his wife is an offence against goodbreeding and good taste which would be simply impossible in real life on the part of such a character the secretdoor in tile library is unworthy the writers inventive power and indeed the whole conception of the incidents to which it leads is faulty and improbable but that portion of barbaras history which occurs previous to her removal from her aunt mrs shakeshaft of stonycroft hall is charmingly told amidst glimpses of english scenery that discover the artist in the author and make those who most desire her success long to find her writing a story that shall rely wholly upon its vraisemblance to realities the most original and bestsustained character in the volumes before us is mrs shakeshaft and wve quite regret to lose her wholly in the second volume and to hear so little of her in the third as for barbaras family the whole might be left out of the book without causing any loss to its interest and with the exception of professor metze the german school is as unproductive of character yet with all its shortcomings barbaras history is replete with evidences of the authors talent clever and brilliant dialogues graphic descriptions of scenery and places with little ripples of wit scintillating here and there and frequent eloquence

on writing such stories as barbaras history she will on some bright day of a lucky season wake up and find herself famous she hos made great progress since the publication of  the story of cervantes and her other books for children the patient labour of a long apprenticeship has not been without good results to the artist for now that she undertakes to amuse a superior and more critical clas3 of readers she brings to the task qualities necessary for the satisfactory completion of an imaginative work seldom if ever found in inexperienced essayists miss edwards however has qualities superior to mere literary facility and acquaintance with the artifices of her art she has humour insight into character a somewhat extensive knowledge of books and a mind thoroughly feminine in tone but strong enough to pass through fields of thought without leaning on a more powerful intellect wishing to do the lady justice we lay especial stress on our recognition of her strength and ability to stand alone  for while we give her full credit for having written a thoroughly readable and at some points deeply interesting novel we may not omit to state that she is greatly indebted to others for the plot principal characters and general tone of her book we tread on delicate ground and are anxious to avoid misconstruction no eharge of plagiarism is either made or insinuated in what has just escaped us it is quite possible that whilst the author was thinking out her story during quiet country walks and in the silent hours of sleepless nights she never gave a single thought to  david copperfield and  jane eyre a clever shy ugly awkward child of a poor proud selfish gentleman barbara churchill is sent from her dull london schoolroom into suffolk where the little girl has an eccentric aunt named ann shandyshaft a lady of landed property whose whims create laughter for miles around her residence stoneycroft hall the little girls journey from town to suffolk her reception at stoneycroft hall and the character of her relation are extracts from  david copperfield  with a difference little barbaras adventure with the dissenting minister who devours her sandwiches whilst the hungry child looks on feeling herself wronged but unable to defend her rights recalls the scene between david and though waiter in the coffeeroom where the latter drinks off the little fellows ale this is only one of many points of resemblance between barbaras history and copperfields experiences the aunts of the two children are distinguishable only by difference of income and social positionmiss ann shandyshaft being a much grander and wealthier personage than miss betsy trotwoodand by a diversity of taste which impels the latter lady to hunt donkeys and the former to drive pigs the intercourse of the one aunt with her nephew closely resembles that of the other lady with her niece it is however needless to enforce a parallel between the two ladies it is enough to say that it exists and then leave readers to detect for themselves the points of similarity adjoining the estate of stoneycroft hall are the domains of hugh farquhar a gentleman of vast powers and wasted opportunities hugh has travelled read suffered much and scandalised society a good deal more when little barbara crosses his path but though he has seen much of the world he is still a young man his country neighbours think he ought to marry and settle amongst them  but the owner of eleven thousand a year is of another opinion he is a gentleman who scorns social trammels and it is delicately hinted that he nurses a secret sorrow after a years stay in suffolk barbara and the two other principal characters of the tale are separatedaunt shandyshaft sending the child home to her harsh father and hugh farquharthe superb the sumptuous mysterious hughtaking his secret sorrow and flashing eyes to foreign landa after a while barbara is sent to a german college where she distinguishes herself as an artist from this point of the book almost to the end of the story mr dickenss influence ceases to make itself felt and the author works away under inspiration drawn from charlotte brontes novels the life of the german college is the college life of villettewith a difference  barbara no longer a feminine edition of david copperfield becomes a refined spiritualized jane eyre  and hugh farquhar who unexpectedly makes his appearance at the college plays the part of mr rochesteralso with a difference the girl and the man fall fiercely in love with each other but instead of throwing himself at her feet and asking for her hand he strives against a love in the gratification of which lies his only chance of happiness the secret sorrow already hinted at the black mysterious trouble of his days forbids him to make the girl his wife at length the offer is made and he is accepted  but even after matters have reached that point hugh farquhar flies from barbara not daring to marry her in defiance of principle of course the reader assumes that like mr rochester hugh farquhar is already married unable to live away from weird little barbara the tempestuous lover returns and they are married a period of continental travel succeeds the ceremony and after a while hugh reluctantly consents to return to england and settle with his young wife at broomhill as soon as she has entered the old mansion barbara begins to suspect that it contains secret apartments from which she is excluded and a mysterious occupant of those apartments whose acquaintance she is not permitted to make time and accident convert suspicion into knowledge barbara ascertains that a lovely woman is kept in the house of which she herself is mistressa woman of whom her husband has never made mention this is the most exciting part of the story first the reader suspects that hugh like mr rochester has a mad wife shut up in his house then that the mysterious lady is a mistress whom he dares to cherish under the same roof with his wife barbara and hugh at length come to an understanding about the mysterious ladythe husband telling his wife a rigmarole little calculated to impose on so j clever a woman and barbaraclever woman and jealous wife though she isaccepting the flimsy statement but the fire is only deadened i not quenched ere long barbara passing along a gallery overhears her husband in private conversation withins beautiful lodger they are sitting together like lovers the lovely italian woman is passionately reminding hugu of her devotion to him and declaring that barbara will never love him as she maddalena has loved and still loves him pleasant talk this for poor barbara a minute later she hears hugh address the woman as  poa mia barbara stays to listen no longer that same night she flies from broomhill and after sickness and peril makes her way to rome eventually a reconciliation is effected between barbara and her husband  and in order that the heroine may not be censured for pardoning the man who appears to have put upon her the worst affront husband can offer to wife miss edwards covers her hero with so thick and complete a coating of whitewash that there ia not enough darkness left to account for what has taken place in the story it is shown that hugh never married maddalenathe reader thereby learning that his indignation against mr farquhar as a bigamist has been murplaced and that in addition to the pleasurable excitement of reading a good bigamy case he has also the pleasure of discovering that the supposed criminal is innocent the whitewashing goes on it is shown that hugh cannot be said even to have seduced maddalenaaye more that he cannot be said even to have loved her true he was his mistress many years before his marriage  but he was drawn into the affair by pity not love for the woman who threw herself at his feet vowing that she idolised him the process of whitewashing is not yet done it is shown that hugh would have married her if he could have done so  but as her existing marriage with an aged and repulsive husband prevented him from taking that step he promised her never to marry any other woman it is proved also that hugh had long since ceased to give maddalena any special signs of personal favour  and therefore that though he was guilty of indiscretion in harbouring her in though same house with his wife he had in no way been false to his marriage vows it does not seem to strike miss edwards that the statements of this whitewashing part are not only inconsistent with her characters but break down the entire framework of her story it is not very probable that a fastidious refined and highly sensitive mana man without any alloy of physical or moral weaknesswould live with any woman under the circumstances described from motives of commiseration  sensitive men do not love women who throw themselves at their feet and play the part of whipped spaniels licking thc dust off their masters shoes it is simply incredible that a keen flippant sarcastic sceptic like hugh could have bound himself to such a worshipper by an unsought promise never to marry another woman  and even if in a moment of weakness he had given such a promise he most ussuredly would not have regarded it as a valid obligation years after relinquishing personal intercourse with the dishonoured beauty again if that had been the true story of his intimacy with maddalena what reason was there for keeping the matter from barbaras knowledge after he bad married her in fact the apology does too much bringing down the entire structure of the tale with a crash let us however say that we like missedwards all the better for her error con senting to humour the existing taste for bigamy stories she was determined not to make too great a sacrifice of womanly dignity for a consideration she would touch pitch  but pitch white and perfumedpitch which ehe might lay aside with clean hands just as mrs ratcliffe used to season her stories with the requisite amount of ghostly horrors capable of explanation in the last chapter so has miss edwards effected a compromise between her own sense of right and the depraved appetite of the public giving zest to her romance by the introduction of a bigamist who as the curtain falls is proved to be a man of exemplary character what her story loses by this compromise the personal character of the lady gains whether it will not be best for her both as a woman and an artist to have no further transactions with white pitch is a question which she will do well to put to herself,lishfiction_contra

fallen in love resolves after the fashion of young men who have been spoilt and who have never had occasion to deny themselves the indulgence of a single whim or emotion in the course of their lives to see more of her and casts about for means of becoming acquainted with the courtneys to this end he displays some ingenuity and by means of an accident created for the purpose by him he gets admitted into their domestic interior the play of the different characters is extremely well delineated mr courtney the father a coldmannered reserved highlybred english gentleman evidently in a wrong positionhis wife delicate sad blameless  but struggling with the influence of some past event which overshadows her life are both very cleverly drawn and give the impression of having been taken from

other which is all very skilfully and truly managed carr becomes confirmed in his intention of proposing for gilda in spite of his ignorance of all her connexions and antecedents partly by the discovery of their sudden intention to quit bologna and partly by an illtimed and extremely detestable letter from his mother gilda might not have been likely to acquiesce in his intentions had not

all the ies she thinks convenient she works artfully upon carr himself she discovers that she herself is the natural daughter of mr courtney and she obtains possession of the family secret of gildas parents this secret is quite dark enough to deter any man who did not love with a devotion and strength of character very rare in the world from seeking their daughter for a wife mrs courtney was a woman of high rank and had been the heroine of a terrible tragedy and cause celcbre she had eloped from her husband her lover had shot him dead in a duel and this was the reason why they were obliged to live in such profound seclusion under a false name gilda of course knows nothing of all this her mother is more than repentant if sorrow could efface crime her father dying of ennui and regret he is anxious to have his daughter married and though he would have preferred poor guido as the one who would have been less likely to be outraged by the knowledge of facts still as guido has drawn back carr cannot be called ineligible and mr courtney resolves to accept him his wife wishes the whole truth revealed courtney like a man decides that it is unnecessary he merely impresses on young carr that the intimacy and proposal had been of his own seeking all the parties act up to their own respective characters and the tragedy of the story results from the natural influence of some quality not exactly reprehensive or some other quality which like the sulphur and saltpetre in gunpowder are harmless until brought together when the result is at the mercy of a casual spark carr marries gilda who is a charming and adorable creature she has told him the truth about guido so far as she knows it herself and then she sets herself to efface the dream of the past and she succeeds it has often been remarked that the daughters of those women who have lapsed from virtue are brought up more carefully and sternly than the daughters of mothers who only know evil by hearsay and mrs courtney has expiated too bitterly the sin of her youth to have left gilda unguarded guido goes away to fight the battles of nis country but not before sara gisborne has made an avowal of her love and been refused in the most chivalrous but decided manner possible being a determined young woman she is not to be repulsed but bides her time and makes use of the knowledge she has obtained to wring terms from mr

ravings and recognises that he has always loved her and that sara has lied it is too late now and the pure womanly way in which she clings to the husband she has taken shutting out all regret or thought of the past is very delicately drawn and is charming unfortunately carr hears accidentally that guido is in thc hospital appearances are against gilda but this time her perfect truth and frankness disarm his suspicious nature but the first grain of sand has been thrown in to trouble the waters carrs mother comes to visit them and the mischief and discomfort from the incompatible natures of all the parties are very true to life in the midst of this the malignant jealousy of sara gisborne comes in maddened that gilda has heard the truth of guidos love for her she writes to

natural conduct towards guido gives rise it is the curse of her parents sin that is working upon her the working up of the dinotimenl is very interesting but not very probable but the reader will not stop to be critical poetical justice is executed on sara gisborne and laurence carr is left at the end a sadder and a better man than he ever had been before this novel is of a higher class and of greater power than the general run of novels we have indicated the main incidents but it is in the working out of the details that the skill of the author is most shown,lishfiction_contra

B4784,['9456054'],  barren honour a tale by the author of guy livingstone 2 vols parker son  bourn the title of this novel is the clue to the lesson which it is intended to inculcate it is generally considered a high crime and misdemeanour against the laws of novel reading to glance at the end of a book till we have fairly and honestly worked our way through the preceding volumes up to the last page without having a notion wnat we shall find there but nevertheless we believe that by bearing in mind the catastrophe upon which the plot is hinged we are not only able to take a more lively and absorbing interest in the story itself but we are also better qualified to appreciate justly and without bias the powers and abilities of the writer in carrying out the design he has in view we do not therefore apologise for quoting here the last words of the author of barren honour  i have attempted he says to sketch roughly what befell a man very weak and erringwho was often sorely triedwho acted ever up to the light that was given him at the cost of bitter selfdenial and selfsacrificewho nevertheless in this life failed to reap the tithe of his reward alan wy verne was strong up to a certain point but he had not faith enough to make him feel always sure that he had done right in defiance of appearances nor principle enough to keep him from repining at results he could neither comfort himself nor others thoroughly he was a chival rous truehearted man but a very imperfect christian he dared not openly rebel against the laws of god but he was too human to accept unhesitatingly the fulfilment of his decrees throughout alans life honour usurped the place where religion ought to have reigned paramount he shrunk from shame when he would perhaps have encountered sin to that one principlesound enough if it had not been the ruling onehe sacrificed love and friendship and revenge and life thus it will appear that the author proposed to himself no very light or pleasant task when he undertook to prove by relating this story what a barren fruitless dreary comfortless and unsatisfactory thing honour becomes when a man has no higher principle of action no more solid basis on which to rest his future hopes sir alan wyverne had but one great object in life the desire to do his duty thoroughly as a gentleman and a man of honourand he did it but his life was a failure the story is an old one but not the less interesting for that sir hubert vavasour is an honest goodnatured reckless country squire with a mortgaged estate an idle son a lovely daughter and last but not least a clever and intriguing wife alan wyverne the squires nephew is not unlike him in character and the two are sincerely attached still more attached however is sir alan to his beautiful cousin helen and though he knows he has already wasted the chief of his substance in riotous living and that lady mildred will certainly  forbid the banns he nevertheless has the temerity to avow his affection to his cousin as well as to her father and ventures to indulge in some hope that it may be possible to arrange satisfactory settlements enabling him eventually to carry off the fair helen as his lawful prize sir hubert is quite aware of all the difficulties in the path but he cannot resist the temptation to make his daughter and his nephew happy so he shakes his bead and consents but owns he has not the moral courage necessary to announce the awful fact to my lady my lady however baffles them all she caresses her daughter playfully reproaches the culprits plan and fairly puzzles her husband by her tacit acquiescence but in her heart she makes a vow that  it shall never be  she thought that such a weddingdress would become her daughter worse than a windingsheet and she will leave no stone unturned to break off the engagement she goes to work warily and with caution and makes alan feel properly grateful to her for her great kindness and consideration she however contrives to persuade him to wait a twelvemonth before fixing the weddingday and she insinuates that her daughter is exacting and absurdlyjealous for the rest she trusts to her usual good fortune and lies in wait for an opportunity to make the most of the little advantages she has already gained on her sons max vavasour return home the tug of war begins in earnest max openly avows his regret at the marriage having been even so far settled he owns he  has no prejudice against wyverne personally for nobody has such weaknesses nowadays but it is a simple question of political expediency max brings his friend lord clydesdale to the dene it is too late now of course to hope any good can come of that but max and his mother understand each other and they have a year before them yet raoul tenth earl of clydesdale was the premier parti of england and a coarse selfish overbearing illlooking young man but it would have been a very proper match for helen and so lady mildred feels naturally aggrieved at the thought of how much had been lost by alans rash and precipitate conduct lord clydesdale moreover no sooner set eyes on helen than he began to think himself an illused man he could have made up his mind to confer on her the title of countess of clydesdale and he did not see what right wyverne had to secure the young lady without even giving him a choice in the matter it was not to be born with patience his friend and toady harding knowles suggests that many things might happen before the fatal twelvemonth is over  sir alan might die you know or miss vavasour come to her senses harding does not object to laying very long odds say 6000 to 50000 that the marriage will never take place the bet ls accepted and booked with looks of wicked crafty significance by knowles who for some trifling reason hates alan and is sadly in want of money from this moment the plot thickens alan is persecuted by letters with a curious cypher engraved on the envelope lady mildred and her daughter receive anonymous letters warning them to inquire into his conduct during his absences from the dene explanations are given and received but somehow they are not quite satisfactory lady mildred pretends to make excuses for him thereby doing his cause a great deal more harm than good helen has seen mrs lenox once and has heard of her often she is hurt and grieved at what she believes to be alans conduct with regard to that dangerous lady but she trusts him still and would conting to trust him till death only lady mildred takes care to prevent that and alan gives up his case as hopeless and retires from the field this is the weak point of the story it is extremely improbable that a man conscious of his own innocence and aware that a trap is likely to be laid for his ruin would voluntarily sacrifice the woman he loves for the sake of the woman who loves him nina lenox is a careless imprudent creature always in trouble either about love or money wyverne does not pretend to care the least about her but he was goodnatured and helped her out of her scrapes and thought her rather a bore than otherwiseyet sooner than betray her confidence to his future wife even in his own justification he quietly breaks off his marriage with helen and makes both her and himself miserable for the rest of their lives this is the great instance of alans preferring honour to every other virtue or even duty helen not caring much what becomes of her after this marries lord clydesdale and hates him though he frees her father from his heavy embarrassments and saves the dene from passing into the hands of the jew who had intended to secure the property for his own thereby earning for himself the eternal gratitude of lady mildred and her son max we will leave the dinodment of the story to unfold itself to its readers at their leisure feeling convinced that with a little judicious skipping of lengthy digressions and superfluous descriptions of character in the first volume they will never rest till they reach the end of the book there is a most exciting description of a fight with some poachers and another of a hunting feat of sir alans which will delight the male readers of barren honour and there can be still less doubt that every lady will sympathise deeply with the sorrows of the countess of clydesdale and be ready to lament the mistaken views of the too scrupulous sir alan who in everything but this overstrained sense of honour is about as perfect and loveable a character as can be met with in any novel of the present day,lishfiction_contra

B6004,['3163797'],  esther waters esther waters is not the turning point in mr george moores literary career in several recent utterances it might have been read that the turning point was reached some time ago that he had worked out his old inspirations or was getting such new light on them as would transfuse them into something new only till now he has had no prominent opportunity of showing the changes in his aims or in his expression of these esther waters will then stand to mark the place where he turned off and sought other things than of old not that he has forsworn all his former methods or his former self but these are made to subserve the impulsive dominating force of the new spirit what mr moore set out to do in this story was to relate the life and adventures of a poor little kitchenmaid whom an unkind fate forced into the household of a racing betting squire and afterwards cast adrift on london in poverty and loneliness the circumstances of such a history are suggestive enough of ugliness meanness and vulgarity and mr moore it must be said has not heretofore been slow to make use of such opportunities well  esther waters  is not an idyll exactly but plunging boldly into the harsh unclean tawdry cruel life of london squalor of racecourse and publichouse glitter he has drawn up the essential reality and behold there is nothing in it alien to heroism of sturdy growth and purity that is inherent honesty courage and wholesome sweetness are hardy blossoms that stand and endure and bloom in poisonous air  esther waters the most vigorous denunciation of gambling that ever was written has been laid it is said under some kind of modified taboo it would be well to discuss this point of view if one could bring ones self to understand it it is easier to conceive of its striking readers as showing a moral purpose far too insistently from beginning to end it is pervaded by a sense of the everlasting usefulness and beauty of moral effort but though the purpose is always evident and near the surface mr moore has reached his particular result mostly by a refining and a ripening of his artistic perceptions the heaping up of detail and circumstance the pride in gathering all the material possible for scenebuilding the photographic method of  include everything as it comesit must be right if its there was an interesting stage in modern fiction accepted by some as a final artistic inspiration while as a matter of fact it was only science putting its spoke in begging art to take life seriously and look it in the face without fear half the behest was based on a complete misunderstanding of the temperament and the uses of art the other half was intelligent but the whole was obeyed for a time with conscientious literalness art is now recovering a sense of its own essential differences and conditions but it has retained a respect for common life and the understanding that such life can be used for artistic purposes mr moore has gone through the discipline he keeps the habit of minute observation some of the old pride in lack of fastidiousness and a belief in the uses of the camera but these he is not mastered by now  esther waters  is a democratic novel through it there breathe not only sympathy with life at its hardest but a hearty and altogether unpatronising respect for the strugglers mr moore exaggerates just as little as he idealises you see no giant tyrant consistently threatening and opposing and killing help friendliness kindliness are lights that stream into betting holes and burn down area steps and amid squalor and low aims for all his french sympathies mr moore has read the english heart aright he has seen the springs that keep it wholesome divined the consolations that keep it from being altogether debased the emotional protestantism of the little sects that gather into their narrow folds so much fervour and tender passion is shown as a living force and not only without cynicism but without patronage  i esther waters by george moare w scott and co there is little of beauty in circumstance or setting mr moore is wonderfully sparing of prettiness indeed his hand is a hard one in only a few passages does the beauty of the world shine through and this is one of them esther has been taken into kent to make friends with the relatives of her lover fred the religious stationer fred was on a ladder shaking the branches but he came down when he saw esther and harry his brother took his place esther and fred filled one basket then yielding to a mutual inclination they wandered about the orchard stopping on the little plank bridge they hardly spoke at all words seemed unnecessary each felt happiness to be in the others presence they heard the water trickling through the weeds and as the light waned the sound of the falling apples grew more distinct then a breeze shivered among the tops of the apple trees and the sered leaves were blown from the branches the voices of the gatherers were heard crying that their baskets were full they crossed the plank bridge joking the lovers who stood aside to let them pass a red moon rose behind the hillside into a dark leaden sky when they entered the house they saw the old farmer who had slipped in before them sitting by his wife holding her hand patting it in a curious oldtime way this is a glimpse as rare to the reader as it was to esther she did not marry fred after all a life with him was the brightest prospect she had ever had but duty with its roots in the past seemed to point away from the paths of comfort and even of strict morality  one doesnt do the good that one would like to in the world one has to do the good that comes to one to do this is esthers philosophy not a bad one faithfully adhered to to be in keeping with his subject mr moore has adopted a very plain diction he has held himself in there is nothing grandiloquent either in sentiment or expression there is no fine writirg at allto tell the truth there is a good deal of uncommonly poor writing but blunders and carelessness apart it is artistic in its methods and its tone it is painstaking plain and detailed like the life it paints there are shorter ways for poets and a poet mr moore is not but poetry after all while making us realise the misery and the heroism as a whole might have obscured what he particularly desired to showthe daily buffetings hourly chances mischances hopes and despairs of those that are not fortunes favourites gy,lishfiction_contra

story the novelists religion is usually of a remarkably polemical nature and beneath the icy blast of controversy the flowers of poetry wither the hand of the artist grows cold and stiff we are all only too well acquainted with the ordinary evangelical romance in which an erudite lowchurchwoman possesses almost in her infancy an amount of protestant learning which would enable her to confute the whole college of cardinals and eventually wins the heart of the richest nobleman in the county with the highchurch novel we are even more familiar for miss young and her imitators have gained for it a certain popularity one which in many cases is not wholly undeserved although there is no little narrowness and intolerance displayed in most of the books of this class dissenters have not availed themselves to any very great extent of the assistance which fiction offers to a zealous proselytizer and we do not often meet with works resembling that american romance in which so great an effect is produced by the heroines determination never to marry any one but a hardshell baptist perhaps as years go by and the thoughts of men expand every sect will have its advocate in fictitious as well as in periodical literature a mormon romancer would have enviable opportunities at his disposal for settling his superfluous heroines and we believe that a genuine sensation might be created by an author who was bold enough to make his hero a conscientious muggletonian if such books appear in our time we shall read them with interest at present it is to a work of a different nature that we propose to call the attention of those of our readers who are not already acquainted with ita story which is not and does not pretend to be a religious novel but one which is full of the most true religious feeling and which without sermonizing teaches a moral lesson that too many sermons fail in inculcating the story of  alec forbes of howglen a reprint of which is now before us endeared itself no doubt to most of our readers when it first appeared two years ago we need not therefore enter upon an analysis of its plot nor is it necessary to follow continuously the fortunes of any but one of its leading characters our present intention is rather to dwell upon the religious teaching conveyed in the account of the mental trials and consolations of annie anderson the storys charming heroine and of the schooling through which she went in the secluded little township in which her lot was cast it is difficult to say which is the most attractive of the two great charms of the book the music of the poetry which renders so many of its chapters melodious or the nobility of the thought by which it is throughout informed of the first it would be easy to fill our columns with specimens so numerous are the prose poems scattered about the story describing the face of nature in its various moods or telling some tale of humble joy or alec forbes of howglen by george macdonald ma london hurst a blackett sorrow pbut we will pass on to the account of annie andersoiis relioious experiences written by nir mt1acdoinald in his graver mood full of deep and genuine feeling and sympathy from first to last wise and tender and true when we first meet with annie anderson she is a delicate child about nine years old with blue eyes half full of tears hair somiewhat between dark and fair

relatiol who rejoices in the kingly namnie of robert bruce the scene with which the description closes of the first day sbe spends in his house giver an1 excellent idea of his nature and of hers very simple and very touching is the account of her horror when after being sent to bed in the dark in order to save the value of a candleend her prayers were interrupted by a terrible noise of scrambling and scratching and scaniperirg in the very room beside hers she knew there were rat3 iear her creatures of which she was terribly afraid and her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth with terror ibut her heart did what her tongue could not docried out with a great and bitter cry to one who was more ready to hear than robert bruce and what her heart cried was this 0 god tak care o me frae the

after to leave the door sjar her next trial is in the dayschool to which she is sent over which presides a village tyrant anamed murdoch malison so terrible to his scholars does he make the hours they spend with hiu that every day to them was a cycle of strife suffering and deliverance birth and death with the lifestruggle between were shadowed out in itwith this difference that the god of a corrupt calviuiim in the person of murdoch mlalison ruled that world and not the god revealed in the man christ jesus most of the children who attend his school feel the day more or less a burden but they go home to heaven for the night annie has no home for the bruces house is none for her so that there is nothing for a time to restore her spirits in the intervals between her sufferings and she loses strength and vitality the little colour she used to have dies out of her cheeks her face grows thin her eyes though tears are seldom seen in them  look well acquainted with tears  and she never smiles for there is nothing to make her smile air macdonald writes about the tyrant with a righteous wrath but also not without a kindly appreciation of the fragment of good that lies buried beneath evil in the mans nature he brings down upon him deserved retribution but then he stays his hand and there are few more pathetic scenes in the story than that in which the schoolmaster after having broken down in his trial as a preacher goes home bitterly feeling the disgrace which attaches to him as a stickit minister and is followed all the way by the limping steps of a poor little fellow whom he had one day accidentally crippled in his anger and who has since become intensely attached to the master who has tried to make up for that wrong by unusual kindness one good result at all events springs out of annies attendance at the school it is there that she becomes acquainted with alec forbes a boy a few years older than herself to whom from that time forward she devotes herself with all the force of a sensitive and enthusiastic nature but it is not to the lovestory contained in mr macdonalds book that we now wish to call attention though a purer and more charming one it would be hard to find we pass on from alec himself to some of annie andersons religious teachers one of these is mr cowie the ministerone of an old schoola worthy kindhearted man  with nothing of what has been called religious experience but he knew what some of his lords words meant and amongst them certain words about little children he had a feeling likewise of more instinctive origin that to be kind to little children was an important branch of his office so he receives anne kindly when she ventures to visit him and to ask him to lend her a poetry book while speaking of her poetic studies we cannot refrain from mentioning the charming scene in which annie recites the first ballad she had learned to her young friends alec and curly macwha in the shop of george macwha the carpenter one may read it and two or three others like it over and over again with neverflagging pleasure the next time annie visits mr cowie she is in deep distress thomas crann the stonemason a calvinist of the deepest dyethe delineation of whose character is a masterpiece of descriptive arthad persuaded her to go one sunday evening to the  missionary kirk there she listened to a terrible sermon by a nreacher  in whom religion was clearly a reality though not so clerl a ld  g otsoclearly a gladness and to whom the moment she looked in his face she submitted absolutely the sermon was on the words the wicked shall be turned into hell and it produced upon annie the immediate conviction that she was one of the wicked and that she was in danger of hell fire when it was over she crept out into the dark street as if into the outer darkness  her first impulse was to run to alec and curly put her arms about their necks and entreat them to flee from the wrath to come but she could not find them tonight she must go home she would pray for herself and for them in her dark little garret where she had prayed before against the rats and had been heard  but alas for p nor annie and her chapelgoing as she was creeping slowly up from step to step in the dark the feeling came over her that it was no longer against rats nor yet against evil things dwelling in the holes and corners of a neglected human world that she had to pray a spiritual terror was seated on the throne of the universe and was called godand to whom should she pray against it amidst the darkness a deeper darkness fell despair comes upon her and in her deep distress she goes as soon as she can find time to consult with mr cowie on her trouble  ye see sir she says  i gaed last night to the missionar kirk to hear mr broon and he preached a gran sermon sir but i haena been able to bide mysel sir syne for i doobt in ane o the wicked at god hates and ill never win to haven at a for i canna help forgettin him whiles an the wicked 11 be turned into hell and a the nations that forget god that was his text sir and i canna bide it poor mr cowie is sincerely anxious to console his little friend but he is terribly hampered by the doctrines of his church he can only tell her not to trouble herself about predestination and election for to those stumblingblocks his conversation with her soon leads and he gives her a shilling by way of relief to his own heart and when she has left him he goes down on his knees and hidcs his face in his hands annie goes away comforted but not convinced and so after a time she tries another spiritual adviser and confides her troubles to thomas crann we would gladly if space would permit extract the record of her conversation with him and the extremely powerful and poetical description he gives her of the night he spent in the peat moss  cryin to the lord for grace and of the joy that filled his heart afterwards when it was revealed to him that he was  ane of the chosen but we cannot refrain from quoting a few lines from the description of another interview between him and annie at a later period when her religious doubts and fears have vanished and her religion has become to her an unalloyed delight thomas crann has had his usually irritable temper still further embittered by illness and the pain arising from a severe accident there were times when he would fall into fits of doubting as to whether he really were one of the elect and at such moments he was particularly savage if any one interrupted his devotions if his housekeeper should then happen to call to him through the door bolted against time and its concerns the saint who had been kneeling before god in utter abasement selfcontempt and wretchedness would suddenly wrench it open a wrathful indignant man boiling brimful of angry words and unkind objurgations through all which would be manifest notwithstanding a certain unhappy restraint having driven the enemy away in confusion he would bolt his door again and return to his prayers in twofold misery conscious of guilt increased by unrighteous anger and so of yet another wall of separation raised between him and his god on some such occasion as this he was disturbed one day by a visit of condolence from one of the deacons of his church thomas was upon his knees by the fireside with his plaid over his head startled by the weavers entrance he raised his head and his rugged leonine face red with wrath glared out of the thicket of his plaid upon the intruder in his anger he drives away his wellmeaning visitor and then returns to his interrupted devotions but he is conscious of having been ungenerous and unjust and he feels  worse than ever and more as if god had forgotten him than he had felt for many a day presently there comes another knock and little annie anderson enters the room so he tells her to come and kneel down beside him that they may pray together without a word of reply annie kneeled by the side of his chair thomas drew the plaid over her head took her hand which was swallowed up in his and after a solemn pause spoke thus oh lord who dwellest in the licht inaccessible whom mortal eye hath not seen nor can see but who dwellest with him that is humble and contrite of heart and liftest the licht o thy countenance upo them them that seek it oh lord here the solemnity of the appeal gave way before the outbursting agony of thomass heart oh lord dinne lats cry in vain this thy lammie and me thine old sinner but for the sake o him who did no sin forgive my sins and my vile temper and help me to love my neighbour as mysel let christ dwell in me and syne i shall be meek and lowly of heart like him put thy speerit in me and syne i shall do richtno frae mysel for i hae no good thing in me but frae thy speerit that dwelleth in 1181 1 after this prayer thomas rises refreshed and hopeful and sends annie on a message of reconciliation to his former visitor the weaver there are many other similar passages in which thomas crann figures over which we would gladly linger but we have only space for one more extract we will take it from the charming scene in which annie is sitting with her blind friend poor old tibbie dyster a great affection has sprung up between the old woman and the young girl and annie who has lately been studying milton has one evening been reading aloud to tibbie samsons lamentation over his blindness the description is very touching of the blind woman listening to the end without word of remark her face turned towards the reader and her sightless balls rolling under their closed lids and so is the dialogue which ensues from which we extract the speech with which tibbie closes a discussion as to whether she knew what the word light meantfor tibbie had been blind from earliest

the humour which chequer it with mingled light and shade and even higher than its artistic merits are we inclined to value those moral qualities which it possesses the breadth of its views the width of its sympathy with the struggles and sorrows of every human soul the freedom of its religious ideas from all that is narrow and cramped and hard it is one of the rare books which when we have read them we desire to keep by us knowing that there will be times when we shall be glad to turn to them as we would turn to a trusty friend  alece forbes of ilowglen by g macdonald ma hurst  blackettmr macdonalds description of a small scotch community in alec forbes of howglen hovers so uncertainly between a direct study of provincial manners and a religiopoetical treatment of northern peasant life that it is difficult to determine on what definite principles he has drawn it the ictures he gives of external nature are often ighly poetical and abound in incidental touches of great felicity but are deformed by the constant occurrence of strained images and rhetorical redundancies the story revolves round the fortunes of two children who grow up to maturity and ultimate marriage in the midst of the struggling life of a poor community the girl whose character is the more studied of the two should have given her name to the tale and falls but little short though very decisively so of being a charming portrait in fact there is just enough merit in most of the features both of conception and structure in  alec forbes of howglen to interest but yet to disappoint the calvinistic system which is criticised and yet accepted as the most rational view of life meets with the same half treatment that most other things do at mr macdonalds hands the narrowness of mind which it produces in most of the persons of the tale is protested against yet an effort is made to show how it can still be reconciled with the softer christian virtues it is impossible to extract poetry from the calvinistic turn of thought where its professors are not the objects of persecution the view of this world and the next which it holds up to its devotees is founded on an antagonism to external authority and can only maintain itself by constant conflict where it has become a dominant system the warfare has to be carried on with spiritual powers and the imagination must furnish forth the forms of danger which are no longer offered by the external world in spite of his opposition to the uncharitable tone which is inseparable from this theology mr macdonald yet determines that in some vague way or other all the personages of his tale in whom he wishes to interest his readers shall be born again and wee their fathers face after a mystical fashion that as might be expected is but little intelligible on the whole this novel is but a childs tale for grown up people it has little root in clearly seized experience and moves about in an atmosphere of diffused poetry and vague theology that is somewhat wearisome and yet one feels a kind of reluctance in speaking of it with disrespect a certain amiable tone which runs throughout the volumes is very attractive and makes us think well of their author but it is a decided fault when on laying down a tale we are more occupied with thoughts of the writer than of the persons he has brought before us the present is an undoubted advance on mr macdonalds former works and if in future he turns to a still closer study of life and character in the outside world mistrusting a certain tendency at present too pronounced towards constructing his characters from the depths of his own consciousness we may yet have a really good novel at his hands  alec forbes of howglen new novels by george mdonald i  ma 3 vols hurst  blackett it is something to rejoice the heart that even in these days a novel can be written full of strong human interest without any aid from melodramatic scenepainting social mysteries and the physical force of incidents alec forbes of howglen is merely the history of some of the inhabitants of an obscure village in the north of scotland a country lass left an orphan and a young boy the sou of a widow a little better placed in the world are the maiu figures in the story but innumerable threads of interest are interwoven with them the human hearts by which they all live are opened to the reader and this is the real source of interestan interest deeper and stronger than can be woven out of mere circumstances however complicated or perilous the dialect of broad scotch in which the story is chiefly written may be a hindrance to indolent readers but the racy idiomatic flavour of the style would we imagine be inducement sufficient to overcome this difficulty there is a picturesque force in the scotch phraseology which takes away all vulgarity from its most homely speech  it may be the sense of the stern calvinistic doctrines under the shadow of which most scotchmen dwell which gives dignity to their expressions the incidents of the story are as we have said extremely simple and almost entirely confined to a small village the mainspring of the interest lies in the development of the inner life and spiritual history of all the characters it is not a religious novel and i yet the growth of the religious element in each  personage is the pervading idea showing how  notwithstanding diversity of gifts and differences j of doctrinal faith the same spirit works through all and that the hidden wisdom of all forms of religious belief and worship is contained in the j one word lovelove working in the heart towards god and towards man the religious  faith growing wiser and stronger as the spirit of love abounds this is a noble doctrine and j it is worthily preached every individual in the  story takes a firm hold of the readers sympathy  their difficulties their weaknesses their faults are all true to human nature and indicate a keen insight into the human heart they are all developed to their full nature and the meaning of their mistakes and faults is worked ont with an understanding heart the most powerful descriptive scene in the book is the great flood and it is masterly alec venturing his life to save annie anderson and old blind tibbi when the dread of the doom of the unconverted sinner has been just awakened within him is real heroism thomas crann the stern puritan who unable to be of active use himself has incited the boy alec to go on the desperate venture suffers more than he crying out in agony  lord let not the curse of the widow and childless be upo me thomas crann thereafter he was silent he remained kneeling his arms stretched out as stiff as the poles of the scaffold and the joints of his clasped fingers buried in the roots of the grass when a friend goes to look for him with the good news that alec is safe thomas fell on his face and he thought he was dead but he was only giving lowlier thanks james took hold of him after a moments pause thomas rose from the earth put his great horny hand as a child might into that of the little weaver and allowed him to lead him whither he would he was utterly exhausted it was hours before he spoke alecs gallant action is narrated with great spirit the night of peril passed by the young girl and the old woman whom he went to rescue is very beautiful it reads like a passage out of  the pilgrims progress the heroism in these three instances is perfectly unconscious and exquisitely appropriate to the individuals the episode of the cruel schoolmaster aud little truffy is painful but the spirit of love works through that also and moulds it to a beautiful ending the sketches of university life in glasgow are very good the temptations and fall of alec into grievous sin and sorrow are firmly handled and the friendship of cosmo cupples the whimsical and learned librarian for alec is admirably introduced and worked out but the reader must read for himself no account of the story would give any idea of the profound interest that pervades the work from the first page to the last  alec forbes of howglen is the work of a poet and it deserves as it will obtain a careful study from those who wish for some more abiding influence than the amusement of an idle hour the ballads and poems which are introduced here and there are all touched with grace and beauty and are well timed in the story,lishfiction_contra

B6772,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it

contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin

tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,lishfiction_contra

terial flaw in its materiel the illus trations two score in number are so fertile in grotesque so abundantly humoursome that our readeis have only to lay them before an angry friend to ensure his speedy return to a good feeling of them we prefer the  an gel of death there is something deep and sonorous in the idea of a spirit having such a corporeal substance as a cannon and something so awful in its fiery eloquence and in the flapping of its wings flags of victory and trophies of many a bloody deed there is in deed a greater depth of feeling and more sterling wit in this device than in any

and prose of the collection the pathetic ballad of poor  marys ghost has been so often quoted as to be in every bodys mouth it is indeed as every subject should be well handled and dissected and as the fair and spiri tual generally are is the prettiest in the collection  tim turpin another pathetic ballad is illustrated by the heads and shoulders of a great and little judge in fact  the judges of asize the life of a resurrectionman  jack hall affords room for a clever design for the entrance into the grave and accordingly we have  deaths door thc description of which as our rea ders are generally interested with archi tectural subjects we shall take the li berty of quoting  and off they set each right content who knows the dreary way they went  but jack felt rather faint and spent and out of breath at last he saw quite evident the door of death all other men liad been unmannd to see a coffin on each hand that served a skeleton to stand by way of sentry in fact death has a very grand and awful entry  throughout his dismal sign prevails his name is writ in coffin nails the mortal darts make area rails a scull that mocketh grins on the gloomy gate and quails whoever knocketh  and lo on either side arise two monstrous pillarsbones of thighs a monumental slab supplies the step of stone where waiting for his master lies a dog of bone  the dog leapt up but gave no yell the

criticism at defiance or what is much the same thing renders anything like an assumption of its usual gravity ridiculous such is the nature of the contents of the small volume before us which like its predecessor under the same title is signalised by the unshackled luxuriance of ks pun and ludicrous collision of similar sounds and opposing associations whether the extreme licence exhibited is always favourable to tl ie piquancy and genuine humour of mr hoods very peculiar drollery may be fairly disputed our own opinion is that he would appear to more advantage if he regulated his whimsicality with somewhat more attention to contrast arrangement and precision it may appear almost a contradiction in terms to say so but we know of nothing which derives more advantage from a moderate degree of restraint than broad mirth a fact the ignorance of which has spoiled many a con vivial party and detracted from the effvct of many a book not even1 excepting those produced by one

for children the story of the good huan has this great merit it is meaut to expand the imagination while it elevates and harmonises the temper the subject matter of the tale is how a great king had a son and prevailed upon a healthy peasant to nurse him neglecting her own child how the young prince grew strong and an admired hero and the young peasant dwindled into a despised cripple how the spirit of revenge converted though cripple into a terrible giant who drank of the cup of revenge till the dregs grew bitter in his mouth  how the spirit of kindness made the giant a dwarf and endowed him with a wondrous power of conciliating love aud obedience and how this dwarf engaged in a mission of charity and gentleness and became finally a martyr and more powerful to inculcate his principles through martyrdom the gallant but at first callous prince with his dumb gentle sister iluan whether as cripple or fierce giant or dwarf strong in love and intellect  with the frail sister whom he loves and all the varied characters the thread of whose destiny is interwoven with theirs are presented to us in the gorgeous colours and imposing forms of an eastern tale but a higher life is breathed into them by the spirit of the homely english moral that at the same time pervades the story the only thing we could havo wished omitted by the author i3 the prefatory enumeration cf authorities for the leading incidents and though corresponding references in the notes children will feel them in the way we have to add that the inculcation of the pacific doctrine is carried to the ultraextrerao but to this we can hardly object the natural pugnacious tendencies are so inveterate that the young human sapling may safely be allowed a very considerable bend the other way we have ourselves we must frankly confess little faith in though efficacy of passive submission to aggression when the fierce mastiff ran openmouthed at the poor haymaker the frightened rustic laid it dead at his feet with his pitchfork but the dog was a favourite with his owner as quarrelsome two legged curs are with nations and horrible were the invectives that assailed though wielder of the pitchfork stripped of those ornaments however the brief dialogue was instructive  why did you kill the dog   because it was going to bite and tear me  could you not have driven him off with the other end of though pitchfork   so i would master if he had run at me with his tail we cannot give a more favourable specimen of the story before us than by quoting the scene of huan s martyrdom he perishes for refusing to sanction an unjust war but his death is only the consummate accomplishment of all the divine objects of his life but the people still looked upon huan as one beloved by god and feared to draw the sword unless he blessed the banners they were to fight under so aleph sought out huan in his dungeon and spake kindly to him promising him his liberty if he would but consecrate the banners of the troops bufc the dwarf answered  ye have set the olivebranch upon them and made the symbol of peace the emblem of war verily to implore a blessing on the one is to invoke a curse upon the other presently newg was brought to the city that the enemy were within a few days march of asulon and the citizens grew alarmed aud again cried aloud for the blessing of the dwarf then aleph knowing the superstition of the multitude feared to lead the people on without kuans benizon so he gathered together his troops and summoning the dwarf from his dungeon bade him in the presence of the assembled army invoke a blessing on the bannersthreatening him with death if he withheld it but huan asked the royal youth by what form of words he should call upon the compassionate the merciful to pour down his grace upon the banners of death  or by what blasphemy he should invoke the spirit of kindness to bless and make holy the flag of slaughter  now when aleph heard the rebuke he shook with anger and the army grew furious crying  away with him to the lions den  away with bim  then the unresisting huan was seized and dragged to the valley beyond though city walls and while some set a rude barrier round about the meadow others hurried to bring the cage of the roaring monster and when they had dragged it thither they placed it io the centre of the field as the hungry beast paced restlessly up and down its den and i made the hills rattle with its roar authy led on by voe threw j herself at alephs feet and besought him by the love he said he bore i her that he would spare her brother er oe too pointing to alephs empty sleeve silently reminded him how huan and the blind girl had saved him from the jaws of death but the young warrior could not forget that his father for the love of him they pleaded for had disinherited him of the throne aud he hated the dwarf not only for having forestalled him of the crown but for the craven principles he taught even whilst an armed enemy was marching to lay waste their city yet in pity for the blind girl who still clung to his feet iwseeching his mercy he aaked the dwarf a third time whether he would bless the banners for the third time huan refused saying he was the minister of kindness and aleph crimson with passion at the mans stubbornness cried  cast him in  let us see how this kindness will avail him with raging lions   then huan was thrust within the arena and the savage monster let loose upon him while the crowd climbed the neighbouring hills and stood breathiest with suspense as they gazed down upon the plain the huge lion sprang from his den and bounded towards huan who stood rapt in prayer but no sooner was the eye of the creature fixed upon the dwarf than the blackmaned beast crouched at his feet and as it rolled on itt back turned up its white stomach to he fondled by bim then huan recognised in the grateful brute the creature whom he had freed of the thorn and as he placed his foot upon the hons side

society labours and he has enveloped it in a kind of jocosity which as often happens in the case of medicines for children is little fess distasteful than that which it is intended to sweeten moreover the comic element is so awkwardly mingled with the serious that its purpose is betrayed at once and we are repelled instead of attracted the story if we may so call it which serves as sweetening to the preaching is as follows  ginxa less grotesque name would have served the authors purpose equally well it is not funnyis a navvy and the baby is his thirteenth child on the birth of the twelfth ginx had vowed to drown the next and proceeds in due course to carry out his vow he is met as he goes to vauxhall bridge by various people among them a philosopher which gives the opportunity for a lecture on malthusianisma subject quite proper in its due place but liable to become improper if treated jocosely the baby is ultimately rescued by a man who takes him to a convent of course the nuns and their confessor have names which are meant to be funny but only succeed in being foolish from the convent he is taken by the protestant association and we have a little chaff of exeter hall and ito proceedings but we will not pursue ginxs baby through his varying career suffice it to say that after being exposed several times in the streets taken to workhouses and rejected by them he at last is adopted by the reform club becomes a page bolts with the spoons and ends by the very fate from which he had been rescued in infancy for he drowns himself from vauxhall bridge we are left somewhat in doubt aa to the panacea which the author himself would recommend for our social ailments  it is either a scheme of emigration or an alteration in the law so as to enable parents to drown their superfluous children from the general tone of the book we should say he means to suggest the former course but on the other hand a remark at the end of the book together with the catastrophe itself incline us to decide for the other we see all rights are reserved including we presume that of dramatising the story now if we may be allowed to advise this is what the author should do let him recast it in a dramatic form leaving out most of the moral part and introducing an immoral part let us say a byplot of an intrigue between sir charles sterling and sister something in the convent get one or two set scenes of vauxhall bridge by moonlight and such like and send it to the theatre if it does not in that form draw crowded houses for six monthswell we shall have our opinion of the modern taste in dramatic matters enormously increased  inxs baby his birth and other misfortunes strahan and co i london 1870 what a london navvy earning eighteen shillings a week ought to find society prepared to do with his thirteenth baby is a question easier asked than answered the historian of the son of ginx is rather severe upon the philosopher the police force the charitable agencies the parish authorities and the club politicians who somehow fail to make life pleasant to his hero  yet they do more for him than for the twelve brothers and sisters who were never threatened with drowning and are guiltless so far as the author explains of any sins of commission which should leave the infant like douglas jerrolds st giles no choice but to grow up in criminal habits to begin at the beginning a wandering malthusian suggests that on the whole ginxs baby had better not have been born he is suppressed by public opinion with a confused sense that the domestic virtues of ginxpadre and mere are on the whole beneficial to the community a relieving officer quotes not wholly unreasonable acts of parliament which constrain the reluctant father to maintain not drown his superfluous offspring the nuns who take the infant in hand next decline on reflection to provide for his body unless they may work their will on his soul a tedious satire on the  protestant detectc al association  is meant to show that charitable organisations have gaps through which any number of units may slip unseen to distress then it is the turn of the poor law guardians who seize the first opportunity of returning ginxs baby on the hands of ginx who deposits it on the threshold of a club in pall mall and emigrates here the authors case begins to break down the club adopts ginxs baby it is fed and clothed and moralised about till it is fifteen and if it is also petted and snubbed by turns that fate is not peculiar to foundlings that it should elope with some spoons instead of donning the livery of one of its patrons and finally commit suicide because it hadnt been murdered in infancy is mere matter of temperament whilst social satire is supposed to deal with types the author of ginxs baly feels strongly on some very important questions and has a fund of righteous indignation at the disposal of those who answer them amiss but his criticism would be fairer if hie did not try to cut up every body in a breath and especially if he would pass by the too obvious occasions for smart writing afforded by newspaper grievances h lawrenny,lishfiction_contra

reputation fighting the hard fight between love and duty selfrelying and at last selfconquering the tory of his trials cannot fail to excite the deepest interest and sympathy in the reader and what of

something highly uncomplimentary to the dominant faction the whole party were arrested and carried before the governor when dorothy procured their release by taking upon herself this  delinquency it was the beginning of an arduous wooing of nearly seven years temples father sir john was a parliamentarian and master of the rolls in ireland sir peter osborne dorothys father had held guernsey for the king after the crash of the monarchy 8ir peter was allowed to return to chicksands and to enjoy some portion of his former estate his sons were eager to raise the fallen fortunes of their house and the hand of dorothy was sought by several wooers who would have been far more eligible than temple in the matter of money the opposition of her brothers to dorothys wishes amounted at times to persecution the eldest john was away in gloucestershire but henry osborne was at cbicksands watching every oppostunity to get his sister  well that is richly  married personally he was deeply attached to her  seriously she writes  i many times receive letters from him that were they seen without an address to me or his name nobody would believe they were from a brother and i cannot but tell bim sometimes that sure he mistakes and sends me letters that were meant to his mistress till he swears to me that he has none    he many times wishes me a husband that loved me as well as he does though he seems to doubt the possibility ont but never desires that i should love that husband with any passion and plainly tells me so he says it would not be so wll for bim nor perhaps for me if i should for he is of opinion that all passions have more of trouble than of satisfaction in them and therefore they are happiest that have least of them dorothy did full justice to her brothers affection though its chief evidence and employment was the endeavour to make her life wretched by pressing upon her notice a succession of suitors all equally unacceptable if not equally odious and urging her to make her choice dorothy says of herself that she is not melancholy though she is thought so by those who think nobody in good humour unless they laugh perpetually she is not the least morose thinking goodnature  so absolutely necessary that where it is wanting nothing can recompense the miss ont the most contemptible person in the world if he has that cannot be justly hated and the most considerable without it cannot deserve to be loved so her buoyant spirits and equable temper carry her triumphantly through her ordeal with one exception to be noticed presently she makes rare sport with her wooers in her epistles to temple in the very first here given she reckons up her  escapes imprimis there was a gentleman so weary of his liberty that he would part with it on any terms  and dorothy as her last refuge got her brother to go down with him and see his house which as she had doubtless heard was wofully out of repair this though it were not much i was willing to take hold of and made it considerable enough to break the engagement since then she learns he has killed his man in a duel and is fled upont she is glad to have escaped him and sorry for his misfortune but soon after is consoled by learning that her  fighting servant is married her mothers death gave dorothy a respite till a gentleman liked her well enough to be very angry that her father would not give 1000 more with her  and i liked him so ill that i vowed if i had had 1000 less i should have thought it too much for him then her cousin sir thomas osborne afterwards earl of danby and duke of leeds cast upon her eyes of favour and made her bis formal addresses which ended in some comical fashion reserved for temples ear sir thomas shortly afterwards married and when he met henry osborne in town we are told they have the most ado to pull off their hats to one another that can be and never speak next some modest melancholy reserved man  began treating with her brother on the inevitable subject and it is going on fair and softly while she writes the gentlemans head is so taken up with little philosophic studies that i admire how i found a room there    tis very possible the next new experiment will crowd me out again dorothy is not above teasing her  servant sometimes and it is fair to remember when reading the next extract that matters had not yet come to a definite engagement with temple it is her humour to represent herself as entirely fancy free  after this some friends that had observed a gravity in my face that might become an elderly mans wife as they term it and a motherinlaw stepmother proposed a widower to me that had four daughters all old enough to be my sisters but he had a great estate was as fine a gentleman as ever england bred and the very pattern of

but shall i tell you what i thought when i knew him you will say nothing ont twas the vainest impertinent selfconceited learned coxcomb that ever yet i saw this solemn fogy was sir justinian isham of

she will have him and then marry temple to one of her daughters for their sakes she regrets her refusal   o my conscience we should have all joined against him as the common enemy for those poor young wenches are as weary of his govern1 uient as i could have been he keeps them so much prisoners to a vile house he has in northamptonshire that if but once i had let them loose they and his learning would have been sufficient to have made him mad without my help she never had but one letter from him bat thut was worta twenty of anybody elses to make sport witb he wrote a latin letter about her which she wishes she had to show temple  twould serve you to laugh at this seven years the worst of my faults was a height he would not cali it pride that was as he had heard the humour of my family  and the best of my commendations was that i was capable of being company and conversation for him she relates how he had bragged as if he might have married lady sunderland wallers sacharissa and algernon sidneys sister and that ldy sunderland was jealous of his attentions to herself  which certainly was a lie as well as the other when her brother tells her th it with all his wisdom sir

and all his generation are worth d irothy disposes of her  parcel of wooers  as gaily as portia they are heart whole with more courage than to die upon a denial  no thanks be to god none of my servants are given to that i hear of many every day that do marry but of none that do worse then she pretends to bewail herself  never anybody had such luck with servants what with marrying and what with dying they all leave me just now i have news brought me of the death of a rich old knight that has promised me this seven years to marry me whensoever bis wife died and now hes dead before her and has left her such a widow it makes me mad to think ont1200 a year jointure and 20000 in money aud all this i might have had if mr death had been pleased to have taken her instead of him well who can help these things   of dorothys life at chicksands she can give an exact account not only for the present but for seven years to come if i stay here so long after rising reasonably early she saunters about in house or garden till ten then dresses and goes into her fathers chamber  from whence to dinner where my cousin molle a fussy valetudinarian bachelor and i sit in great state in a room and at a table that would hold a great many more after dinner we sit and talk till mr b a suitor comes in question and then i am gone the heat of the day is spent in reading or working and about six or seven oclock i walk out into a common that lies hard by the house where a great many young wenches keep sheep and cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads i go to them and compare their voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses that i have read of and find a vast difference there but trust me i think these as innocent as those could be i talk to them and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the world but the knowledge that they are so most commonly when we are in the midst of our discourse one looks about her and spies her cows going into the corn and then away they all run as if they had wings at their heels i that am not so nimble stay behind and when i see them driving home their cattle i think tis time for me to return too when i have sapped i go into the garden and so to the side of a small river that runs by it when i sit down and wish you were with me you had best say this is not kind neither in earnest tis a pleasant place and would be much more so to me if i had your company i sit there sometimes till i am lost with thinking  and were it not for some cruel thoughts of the crossness of our fortunes that will not let me sleep there i should forget that there were such a thing to be done as going to bed as to her reading it is mainly in the french romances then in vogue for the translations of them she has no patience they are still so french in words and phrases that no one ignorant of that language could make anything of them she is for a plain style prefers writing to puttiog pen to paper and dislikes her brotherinlaw peytons letters excellent for what i know and the more likely because i do not understand them as much as the affectation of an acquaintance who would never say  the weather grew cold but that winter began to salute us she sees the poems of lsdy newcastle and is  satisfied that there are many soberer people in bedlam in one particular macaulay is hard on dorothy he speaks of her style as sometimes nambypamby passing over the anachronism we note the injustice she writes always with selfrespect though very frankly and if often tender is never weak and if her good taste is ever at fault it is in imitating the turns of her favourite romances but this happens very seldom the endings of her letters warm significantly and gradually from your humble servant to your faithful and your affectionate friend and servant to  yours or your sometimes with no signature at all till at lastafter fifteen years of wedded lifeshe is her  best dears most affectionate d t if she were really the correspondent of queen mary it was an unequal match between the two good womenone of whom wrote in her bible that it was given  the king and i on our orownation day dorothy has a friend whom she greatly admires and whose acquaintance she is eager that temple should makelady diana rich daughter of the earl vf holland who makes so many sore eyes with looking on her though  her beauty is the least of her excellencies the poor lady came to have sore eyes literally herself and thereby it seems lost a lover it mattered little aubrey tells the story of her strange meeting with herself as in a lookingglass in the grounds of holland house and ot her death soon after into the promised land of marriage dorothy is continually gazing as from some pisgahsome  specular mountand taking note of the ways of married folk  for example of life and instruction of manners she doubts that marriage alters some people strangely from the instance of one she had known so handsome so capable of being made a pretty gentleman transformed into the direct shape of a great boy newly come from school to see him wholly taken up with ruuning errands for his wife and teaching her little dog tricks and this was the best of him for when he was at leisure to talk he would suffer no one else to do it not that she is inclined to blame the men wholly she rather leans to the opinion  that there is no such cross as a wife and that  much of the blame lies in us for let the husband be what he will  his anger alone when it meets with nothing to resist it cannot be loud enough to disturb the neighbours and such a wife may be said to do as a kinswoman of ours that had a husband that was not always himself and when he was otherwise his humour was to rise in the night and with two bedstaves labour on the table an hour together she took care every night to lay a great cushion upon the table for him to strike on that nobody might hear him and so discover his madness but tis a sad thing when all ones happiness is only that the world does not know you are miserable she thinks it might be well that all such as intend to marry should live together in the same house for some years of probation and if they never disagreed should then be permitted to marry but she is struck by the reflection how few would do it then  if people proceeded with this caution the world would end sooner than is expected the calmness with which these matters are discussed almost disconcerts us till we remember that the writer is a young woman of sense intent on making a really prudent choice and  wanting courage to marry where she does not like being a firm disbeliever in the theory that love will follow marriage and she does not trust passion blindly either  where there is no reason to uphold a passion it will sink of itself but where there is it may last eternally with public matter unless they bear on the fortunes of those she loves dorothy meddles not at all when the long parliament is dissolved she is only anxious to know whether temple is at all concerned in it  for if you are not i am not only if i had been so wise as to have taken hold of the oller of henry cromwell i might have been in a fair way of preferment for sure they will be greater now than ever she enquires whether algernon sidney was really turned out and wonders whether mr pym might not have thought this as great a breach of privilege as demanding the five members  but i shall be talking treason by and by if i do not look to myself when temple is in london she gives him  little idle commissions a quart of orangeflower water from the great shop the flower pot over the exchange or the setting of her seals by a frenchman near salisbury house of her own diversions in town besides her being every night in the park and at new spring gardens we read little she heard stephen marshal preach and was disappointed  i listened to him as if he had been st paul and what do you think he told us  why that it there were no kings no queens no lords no ladies no gentlemen nor gentlewomen in the i world twould be no loss to god almighty at all this we had over some forty times which made me remember it whether i would or not at a later time she helped a cousin of hers successfully in fooling the impostor lilly  making him contradict himself the strongest that ever you saw but town life was not attractive to dorothy who had other reasons than her fathers illhealth for liking to be at chicksands her brother is for a while prevailed upon not to bring any of the suitors thither from the tittletattle that it breeds among neighbours that have nothing to do but to inquire who marries and who makes love but the current of life is not wholly unruffled there are agues and spleens and too often teasing coxcombsmr bennett mr talbot mr fish and mr freeman and greater troubles are ahead sir peter is manifestly going dorothys marriage therefore becomes a more urgent matter with her brother who wants to have a footing in his sisters future home the engagement with temple is suspected dorothy takes a pleasure in the recreation of confounding her brother and destroying all that his busy head has been working on since the last conference all her refusals are brought upon the stage like richard iiis ghosts from being the kindest brother and sister they grow deadly polite the most complimental couple in england at last came the dispute referred to by macaulay wherein says dorothy  we talked ourselves weary  he renounced me and i defied him it was a pity that macaulay did not recall the reconciliation of next evening wherein the disputants entering on the subject of religion talked so long ol it and so devoutly that it laid all our anger we grew to a calm and peace with all the world two hermits conversing in a cell they equally inhabit neer expressed more humble charitable kindness one towards another than we he asked my pardon and i his and he has promised me never to speak of it to me while he lives but to leave the event to god almighty this was no lasting relief at christmastide 1653 matters grew so melancholy at chicksandsher father dying her favourite niece and companion gone her lover irritated and jealousthat dorothy for once lost heart and longed for a quiet and early grave she begged temple to give up an engagement that promised no happiness to cither and her earnestness prevailed with him not indeed to grant her request but to be more reasonable in future and to help her in her troubles ia stead of adding to them it was time sir peter died in the spring of 1654 his harsh heir came to chicksands and dorothy went to london where her aunt and her brotherinlaw took charge of her by turns temple her  dearest now was in dublin with his father awaiting some appointment which might enable him to marry for dorothy was no sentimentalist though entirely disinterested  had you 20000 a year she tells temple  i could love you no more than i do    but certainly i know what an estate is but yet i would not be thought so inconsiderate a person as not to remember that it is expected from all people that have sense that they should act with reason  if any accident out of my power should bring me to necessity though never so great i should not doubt with gods assistance but to bear it as well as anybody    but if by my own folly i had put it upon myself the case would be extremely altered the good sir thomas peyton exerted himself here as he did in any case wherein his help was needed at knowlton it seems matters were finally arranged between the temples and the osbornes as in greater diplomacies there were punctilios difficulties sir john temple objected to osbornes bearing a part in the negotiation on account of the unhandsome reflections cast upon his son this was of course absurd as peyton could settle nothing without osbornes consent dorothy upon this for the only time in the correspondence loses her temper but checks herself in time  tis best for me to end here lest my anger should make me lose that respect i would always have for your father when all is eettled worry and suspense have done their work on dorothy and she has an attack of smallpox but though her beauty is gone at least for the time her goodness guards ber interest in temples heart their married life had more than an ordinary portion of sorrow of their nine children but two survived their infancy the daughter diam died in 1684 of her the only memorials are a charming childs letter to her father and her name upon a tablet the son john temple a week after accepting office under william

B1220,['8533490'],  cripps the carrier cripps the carrier by r d blackmore london sampson low and co  cripps the carrier is not so good a novel as  lorna doone but then  lorna doone  may fairly be said to rank amongst the very best of the novels of our day that fall short of being really great novels indeed since the last of the immortal waverley novels came from the busy brain and active hand which having fought so long were to be so soon silenced the class of writings which though not absolutely historical romances were yet laid in a time and among people different from our own have not been over numerous  lorna doone  may claim a good position among them not indeed with esmond or with barry lyndon the cause of so many tours de force most notably george augustus salas clever  captain dangerous nor with the virginians even but belonging to the school of these and not unworthy with  the cloister and the hearth perhaps fitter comparison may be made for if the story of erasmus father and margaret of the redgold hair be greater the feeling that invests john ridd and his surroundings is more closely akin to the time in which the tale is placed than is mr reades work to days mediaeval it must be at once admitted that as never before mr blackmore wrote so good a novel as his romance of exmoor so never since has he approached very near to it but cripps the carrier is a much closer approach than its predecessor  alice lorraine is indeed very greatly its superior if it possesses many of mr blackmores distinctive defects it also boasts of most of his distinctive merits mr blackmores chief faults are a certain vagueness in his grasp of a story as an artistic whole a confusion and apparent incertitude dependent upon this as well as a tendency to diffuseness  and worst of all perhaps a habit of bringing many of his characters before his readers as if he assumed them to be already well acquainted and therefore deemed it unnecessary to further enlighten them for this reason and because the chief charm of mr blackmore lies in his great descriptive powers and his sharp and sudden analysis of nature more than in his power of telling a story he is seen at his best when he informs some single subject when as in  lorna doone  and  the maid of sker he tells his tale in the first person either as the person most interested therein or as some keen observer the reason for this is obvious enough that he is compelled to hold himself together as it were cannot allow himself to be so carried off into perpetual fresh woods and pastures new as is his wont in other cases moreover no matter how many characters he may bring upon his stage he is compelled to govern their actions by the observation of a single person whereas when dealing with them by himself he seems to get so interested in eaoh one as it arises as to for the time being lose all consciousness of the others the story and indeed all things beside in his anxiety to follow out the feelings of the puppet whose strings he happens at this moment to be pulling suddenly he remembers that he is not writing an exhaustive analysis of a human character and he hurries back with a start  to some other of his creations and in the frequent repetition of this process so much time is lost that the chronicle is at last if not exaotly brought to a lame and impotent conclusion at least considerably hurried and confused in its ending it would be indeed difficult to dramatise one of mr blackmores stories because there is in them so little of dramatic completeness as stories they are incomplete and incoherent as studies of character they are too often marked with sameness but in spite of these defects and the perhaps still greater one that his women are little more than names the fact still remains that it is his power as painter poet and philosopherfor he seems to exercise each of these capacities in his writingsthat make his works so praisedeserving between  lorna doone his greatest work and therefore containing the greater portion of his merits and  alice lorraine in which his defects were most marked  cripps the carrier may take a middle place but if not fairly made midmost then nearer to the latter than to the former novel the story is complicated and apparently impossible in its leading idea which is however simple enough the scene is laid in oxfordshire close to the university town the heroine grace oglander is carried off from her family by the family lawyer and villain of the story luke sharpe and hidden in a remote cottage she believing herself to be acting in obedience to her fathers wishesa belief induced by means of forged letters in her fathers name which tell her that he has been compelled to go to demeraraand to be thirty miles from oxford and her home instead of close at hand the object of this forced abduction has been on the part of the lawyer that she may marry his son christopher who will thus come in for her fortune but who is a manly young fellow wholly guiltless of art or part in his fathers plan luke sharp causes squire oglander to believe that his daughter has been murdered a belief that nearly kills the old man  but in the end the plot is discovered on account of christopher sharpes refusal to be a scoundrel and carry out his fathers plans grace is rescued by cripps the carrier lawyer sharp blows his own brains out and grace marries her lover russel overshute who does not however play any very prominent part in the story because like ivanhoe he is ill throughout the greater part of the tale the probability or improbability of the story need not bo discussed it is the right of the artist if he chooses and if his strength justify it to do as he likes in this matter that chloroform was not invented at the time does not destroy the interest in the chief event in the  tale of two cities that joan of arc did not die on the field of battle that mary stuart and elizabeth tudor never met do not alter the merits of schillers two great dramas  all that is demanded is that it shall appear to be possible and this the plot of  cripps the carrier seems scarcely to be it is overcrowded with figures a fact all the more regrettable because some are so excellent that it would have been better if the artistic force spent on the many others had been appropriated to their fuller development cripps the carrier himself the hero is a study worthy to stand by the side of  girt jan ridd  zacchary had a bright open face with a short nose of brave and comely cock a mouth large and pleasant and mild as a cows a strong square forehead and blue eyes of great vivacity and some humour he had true cripps hair like a hornbeam hedge in the month of january and a thick curly beard of good hay colour shaven into three scollops like a cloverheap his manner of standing and speaking and looking was sturdy and plain and resolute and he stuck ont his elbows and set his knuckles on his hips whenever both hands

corner of his ways kind of heart and fond of children loving all simplicity quick to catch and glance the meaning of minds very different from his own subtle  also and deep to reason but never much inclined to argue he had a shy and very peculiar manner of turning his eyes away from even an undergraduate when his words did not command assent as sometimes happened with freshmen full of conceit

humour his view of things was nearly always anxious and earnesthis standingpoint so fixed and stable that every subject might be said to revolve on its own axis during its own revolution round him and

the swift sudden sayings wherewith thackeray would lay a soul or that shred of the spirit of human nature which stood instead of a soul bare before his audience of the heroine there is little to be said taken altogether  cripps the carrier is a fine book containing some characters noble in conception and in execution much too to which though incomplete praise must perforce be awarded for the strength shown and through all the book present everywhere is that great power of describing nature so simply and yet so clearly which recalls the fact that mr blackmore has translated the georgies of

very goodsized one yet wishing to accommodate the multitude of his friends he borrowed the me of the adjoining house and gave his guests the freedom of both still as i have said the party was a jama

joke that it would be just as difficult to count the sheep after they were marked as before the party of spectators broke into a roar of laughter and jo looking a little  sheepish but taking the joke very good naturedly hurried out of the pen with all possible haste we have taken on board two small droves of negroes one of ten boys and girls mostly the latter bought in richmond for a plantation near vicksburg they cost the owner all expenses included about ten hundred and fifty dollars a head i asked the bestlooking girl of the lot her name she said it was cinderella slaves like the early christians have but one name and that her master had bought them for his own use i asked what that meant and she said to work on his plantation and not to bell again they all seemed perfectly satisfied with their emigration to louisiana another lot of twenty were taken on board lower down the river and were on their way to the neworleans market to be sold all except one a mulatto girl who seemed to be the travelling companion of the owner and would return with him one fellow became obstreperous and had to be put in irons among the objects of interest on the river none excites more attention than the lowly mansion of general taylor at baton rouge it is a mere cottage and a very humble one at that but as the home of a president of the united states it gives a historical character to the place and the traveller watches for it with eager curiosity from baton rouge to new orleans a distance of over a hundred and twenty miles the sugar plantations line both sides of the river and the green fields green trees with here and there clumps of orange groves rich in fruits and blossoms make one feel that the people of louisiana like the cuckoo need have no sorrow in their song no winter in their year here is bellewith a hint at the endat newport  well i went to the  hop at the  fillmore and achieved a belles ambition dancing every time but with the same partner pa having consented to my waltzing with cousin charles you know the most fastidious of fathers always consent to the cousinly intimacies involved in these fashionable dances do you know it is the custom here for a lady to take a dancing gentleman with her to the hop on whom she leans and relies as her partner for the evening  there is very little promiscuous dancing here and the only way to  keep the floor is to have a partner constantly on hand everybody voted the fillmore hop a perfect success it was the best attended and the ladies looked their prettiest the room the dining saloon was brilliantly lighted  and there was a rich display of fringes and flounces of necks and necklaces a very superb looking lady from new orleans wore a bouquet of diamonds pearls and precious stones which  they say cost 20000 dollars it made all lesser trinkets  pale their ineffectual fires it is no use trying to eclipse everything be as brilliant and extravagant as you will some provoking madame allcash will be sure to outshine and outdash you this dressing for show is a rather costly and unsatisfactory business what a pity it cannot be dispensed with altogether i should like to live in a planet where costume would grow upon us where we could leaf con bea k ver one the the ani for so wa w tic ca do as y th as mi ra f oe fr wi lo  ri di q si out and bloom out like vine and lilies and where children could be gathered from the trees like peaches who knows but we shall be  put through  ooaree of sprouts similar to ibis in some of the worlds to come   now i am going to tantalise the disciples of old isaac by giving a brief account of the sport we had in fishing yesterday and let me say in advance that every word of my fish story is true accepting an invitation from mr henry ludlam a fine specimen of a true virginia gentleman whom i met at the hop we started yesterday about 12 oclock for the  fishing grounds the party consisted of four gentlemen and no more ladies than that number of gentlemen usually desire to have with them on such an excursion i am not going to tell where we wentonly that we fished sitting or standing on terra jirma and caught as many twelve pounders as we cared to take home in two waggons and blue fish at that the strongest and gamiest fish that swims i now perfectly understand the force of the common expression as  wide awake as a blue fish my arms are positively lame from pulling them in mr ludlam who is the most expert and artistic fisherman in newport taught me how to put on the bait and then all that was wanting was skill to throw the line and strength to pull in the beautiful tinnies looking so sweet in their white vests and blue coats with distended gills that looked like red ruffles oh it was  fun alive in the evening after returning mr ludlam gave us a splendid fish supper when i learned a new sensationthe exquisite pleasure of eating the game of ones own catching today the breakfast and dinner tables of the  ocean house have abounded in unwonted piscatory luxuriesthe fruit of our  q yesterdays doings i no longer marvel at the j  angling mania having been fairly bitten with it in e the glorious success of yesterday i dont know w but i should like to enlist for a three months fishing i  voyage for mackerel cod or even for whale as i j am inclined to think the larger the game the greater i t the sport ps ladies who go fishing should i  leave their hoops at home as sitting in them on  i the rocks is as hard as sitting on a gridiron u c a bachelors ball and what belle thought i c of it j bravo bellevue eichelors you did the j f handsome thing last night that brilliant ball j  was a regular eclipser such dressing and un i  dressing of beautiful women was never before seen j in newport the fine saloon was crowded and  the tasteful pink decorations with pyramids of  i gasfixtures in the corners lighted up the scene as  the italians say a giorno sister and i had between j us a couple of beaux fresh from new york who  kept us from feeling alone in the crowd and helped   us bountifully to the  chicken fixins and other things the affair was unanimously voted a great i success and only cost the bachelors who gave it a v apiece some of the costumes were magnificent  beyond my power of description one dress in particular worn by a finelooking mother of ten children was perfectly stunningthe admiration of all the gentlemen if not the envy of all the ladies it was the richest pattern of moire antique in red and white that i have ever seen the splendour of the bodice was subdued by a lace bertha of misty fineness and the whole effect including about a pint of diamonds poured over all was dazzlingly brilliant or as mrs partington would say the tout en scramble was perfectly munificent but the oddest whim exhibited in the way of ornament was a headdress composed of gold pieces about the size of a halfeagle i did not count them up but i should think there was at least a hundred dollars worth attached to the young ladys hair by fine gold chains and dangling around her neck and ears it was decidedly a ditmffit4 conceit and reminded me of a man i once saw in new orleans who was adorned all over with gold coins of all sizes but the pretty young lady who wore them looked like an indian princess in her barbaric ornaments and surely the fashion has economy to recommend it unlike most other feminine trinkets it will always be worth what it cost another finelooking new york lady wore is her hair imitation ears of im4ivn corn as large and as natural as life my  private beau who from his long habit of writing for the  knickerbocker is always on the scent of a pun very gravely whispered in my ear that there was one beauty in the room decidedly  corned bat the fair lady need not be ashamed to  acknowledge the corn her ornament was original national and becoming and she looked handsome enough for the embodiment of the great maine institution so beautifully embalmed  in the song of hiawatha  the following is perhaps written to awe the critics since the discharge and departure of mrs woodman the gossips have had their tongues tickled by an affair  in fashionable life as it is called in which mibs  a dashing young prima donna in one of our fashionable churches appears as the party of the first part and a fashionable young man the party of the second part it seems that the gentleman had taken the small liberty as the frenchman said when he kissed his wife of making some offensive remarks touching the character and habits of the damsel aforesaid whereupon the lady louisa dresses herself for the occasion calls for a carriage picks up a female friend to see the fun and rides up and down broadway holding a neat little  rod in pickle on the look out for the offender she espied him near the  bowling green and on stepping out of the carriage proceeded to apply the cowhide to her traducer to the satisfaction of both parties the question discussed among the young mens clubs is how ought a gallant gentleman to act in a similar situation to strike back is out of the j question to run away is cowardly to seize the weapon might involve a hard struggle and close  embrace what then is to be done if the i woman is pretty kiss her if not absquatulate  with all possible despatch  j not knowing much more what to make of i i belle brittan than sir john contrast did of  moll flagon we too will  absquatulate with decent despatchleaving belle to the judgement of her readers and only speaking decisively on one pointviz that we hope mr charles mackays heart is safe or belle by cajolery 3 flattery puffing or caressing will certainly be ii off with it but mr mackay knows belle   brittan we suspect too well to be in this peril,lishfiction_contra
B7448,['6833495'],  tunoriu rhodesia with thk sharpshooters by kennie stevenson the odd thing about south african war books is that although they are far too many each can plead if it does not bear in its very title a raison detre each has a public thus t  some readers the record of the long and lonesome marches of lord dunravens sharpshooters must of necessity be the most interesting book on the war yet published simply because it is concerned with themselves or their friends but even the general reader repleted as he is can turn without dismay to a book which tells its story in only 200 uncrowded pages mr stevensons aim is simply to describe thornside working of a squadron on the trek and a very amusing and touching story he makes of it the  last post sounds drearily over a comrades grave a kaffir sells a jug of beer and forgets to bring back the change out of a sovereign  camp humours canteen talk scares from hyenas and difficulties with wagons lend variety to the eternal programme described by a poetic trooper as  trekking trekking trekking always ballywell trekking from reveille until lights out our work is never done no troops we imagine have seen more of the wild and desolate life of the veldt jungles and forests of south africa than these sharpshooters one of mr stevensons most unnerving experiences was losing himself for several hours in the forest with monkeys jeering at him from the trees the sharpshooters ran all sorts of risks from wild animals sometimes a whole pack of hyenas and jackals would get on their track as many as fifty of these dangerous beasts following them mile by mile so that when a man wished to fall out three or four others remained to protect him scorpions tarantula and vermin afflicted the men in camp the task of drawing water at night from the nearest river or well was not a comfortable one in view of wildbeast amenities but the only lion with which our author actually tried conclusions he fired directly between its eyes turned out to be a pair of harmless glowworms some odd things happened one dark night when we were sitting around the fire a trader glided through the camp riding a white donkey we were all thunderstruck we thought there wasnt a white man near us for at least eighty miles one chap rather aptly expressed our feelings by crying out 4 here whats the name of that steamer   the trader never looked round but passed away into the night as mysteriously and softly as he came that story has a weird quality that we like  but indeed the whole book is a striking little record of such stern and fearless picnicing as britons love macqueen,lishfiction_contra
