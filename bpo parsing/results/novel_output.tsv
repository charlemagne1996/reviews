B2902,"['9419058', '6810244', '3278138', '6834903']",  new novels pig8 in clover by frank danby heine mann frank danby falls between two stools the opening chapters of  pigs in clover give promise of an interesting study of english life on normal levels but we are disappointed on the entrance of karl althaus the south african millionaire several characters including a woman whose luckless blood is scientifically inherited from a demirep have a life and reality of their own but alas this does not carry us beyond the first sixty pages with karl althaus the novel takes a turn for the worse and becomes quite another thing with long lanes that seemingly have no ending and a mesh of characters and interests that are disproportionate and out of perspective there is for example mrs de groot who is described as the author of the kaffir and his master and who is also represented as making common cause with the prime minister of cape colony against the boers althaus is one of the hebrew millionaires who threw in their lot with the late cecil rhodes the advisability the taste and even the practicability of introducing contemporary people into modern fiction are open to doubt but we should say that there could be no question as to the verdict on the course frank danby has seen fit to adopt if through her delay says the prime minister of cape colony when the jameson raid is reported to him her damnable calm and red tape there is a hair of one of those mens heads injured ill pull the place down upon her i ii make hell through the length and breadth of the by continent this is the style in which he is made to talk to althaus and which should make the blood of history curdle karl althaus jew is a noble creature as all millionaires must be on the other hand louis althaus half gentile is a scoundrel and mrs de groot is a fool we should not have dwelled upon the unsatisfactory nature of this novel had we not seen in it the germs of something really good as it is frank danby seems to us to have simply wasted her material  pigs in clover by frank danby heinemann 6s there are two ways of pessimism in art one tnices the cruelty of circumstance the other of humanity from this passionate novel which we have seen miscalled  smart we cull a sentence that shows frank danbys way of pessimism  the bright elusive womanhood which had bewitched karl louis saw shy and wild and he wanted it as men always want to bring down wild things it is then a woman whom we see piloted into tragedy in reading these pages and in fact they reveal two women whom charon could hardly have conducted to shores gloomier than those they reached one is a politicians neglected daughter whose quixotic generosity entraps her into a foul marriage whence she emerges a creature who  always did what she was told the other is an author famous for a novel of south africa and she is the bright elusive lady in our quotation the man whom she thought might inspire a chapter wheedles her into adultery snubs her pen into silence finally lays his mean and faithless spirit bare before her yet never calls to the loving animal in her nature without shaking her with a frenzy of obedience for he is essentially belami a creature with genius in his flesh like the debauched journalist who prowls through de maupassants immortal pigstye there is no escape from his evil allurements save by death or flight imagine these women moving in the highest circles about the time of the jameson raid imagine finance in hundreds of thousands and controlling them a great softhearted jew who bawls that wrhen the jew is honoured as a jew he will shout in his synagogue  i believe in christ thank the great god i can say it now there is indeed plenty of bustle and chatter and actuality to persuade us that joan and aline are women of an unremote yesterday the vulgar references to gladstone are to ba regretted and it must be confessed that the identification of fictitious persons with public events is managed rather unadroitly one suspects a roman  def but there is neither losk nor key the strength and intensity of the novel however are beyond dispute  pigs in clover by frank danby 6s heinemann the two persons in  pigs in clover with whom one always remains in complete sympathy are the rugged greathearted millionaire karl althaus and the sad sweet little englishwoman joan separated

persuades her to marry him having learned how she has been betrayed and deserted by the brother he now disowns it is difficult to believe that even aline could be so innocently impervious to friendly warnings while louis and joan renew their old acquaintance in karls absence and that when she finds joan weeping in louis arms she did not grasp the full significance of the situation unless we accept her as a wholly irresponsible imbecile alines earlier schoolgirl romance and its culmination in marriage smith the drunken jockey jack forrest are admirably well done and the hiding of that scandal and the farreaching consequences of it all help in the shaping of a well imagined and ingeniously constructed plot frank danbvs references to the late mr gladstones home rule policy are as gratuitously insolent as her shrieking admiration of the jameson raiders is hysterical but away from such debatable ground in south africa before the war in london financial circles in various phases of political and social life the story is convincingly realistic and is written with a skill and dramatic picturesqueness that should ensure its popularity  pigs in clovek by frank danby a long story

B1018,['4382380'],  blondel parva we do not agree with certain minute philosophers who believe that the death of the devil would ruind the clerical profiuion but we really think that the romancist ought to thank good ness for the existence of vice and rascality for such spirits are as essential to him as the breath of life which he could no more dispense witl than he could dispense with bread and butter or the printingpress which is about the same thing indeed in a very practical sense there is to the storyteller a soul of good in things evil it is his peculiar function to take care that the evil a man does shall live after him though it must be admitted that the same function will not permit him to let the good he does be always interred with his bones hence is it that in every story which does not rise above a fair mediocrity of art certain almost invariable quantities of viae and virtue are re presented with mechanical periodicity in the dismalness of punishment or by the brilliancy of reward here for instance is another story by that indefatigable workman the author of l lost sir massingberd and other tal of a similar gustatory type  blondel parva has the merit of being in two volumes but it has the demerit of being com pounded of very common though fairly handled materials it contains as a background three rogues created from the seething rascalities of the turf by the way what rich stores of moral and tragic ambiguities the turf has recently produced for the use of future storyologists in the foreground of the picture are two brace of excellent lovers whose commiend desire to love and be loved to marry and be maried in shame fully interfered with by the sinister influences of the rogues in question and by other serviceable causes one of the lovers is a poor curate the other a literary barristera type of which is becoming quite popular among mitre of fictao though we are sorry to observe that they do not always cut an unh ble figure in the present instanck we ae hay to announce that the literary aracteris not only wholly yespe6 able but is one of the most effaient ators ix te diodu  bloai pam by the asceor of let la or gh two v loadon badbluq evams a co rarva  drama he is in fact the active pivot round whom mainly the incidents of the tale revolve and upon whom with the lady whom he loves they principally concentrate in the end two of the rogues die while the third lives and keeps the dramatic kettle boiling he is the evil spirit who would sacrifice everybody on the cloudy altar of his own infinite desires but as it is only the comparative degrees of evil that for a time succeed this man fails at once through the impolitic extent of his own heartless greed the action of the fates being somewhat slow on the side of justice virtue and love while he is enjoying his criminallygot gains nemesis in the form of the hero steps in and with a single blow shatters the wretchs dreams of turfy triumphs and social distinction the heroine is by this means rescued from the fastapproaching dogs of poverty and disgrace and the curtain falls amid a sweet flicker of hymeneal candles let it be said in favour of the author that his story is in a popular sense very readable it advances through its various scenes and acts at a good rattling pace none of the characters allow the grass to grow under their feet so that the reader is never in danger of falling asleep here and there too throughout the two volumes gleam out some pretty touches of landscape dewed with the poetic spirit put the weakness of the whole business lies in the fact that it seems to be the production of pieceworkas if it had been written to order according to a certain pattern and at the shortest notice this seems to be the method adopted in the production of a certain species of modern fiction the old elements are flung into a mill and turned out immediately spickaudspannewnew in the sense that paper is new while we know it to be the product of old rags the author of  blondel parva  owns a lively stock of his own and we should be the last to accuse him of lifting other peoples cattle yet somehow in his new story the characters seem old and familiar as if we had seen them a thousand times something of this kind is perhaps inevitable in all cases and any originality which is possible to a writer will only appear in the manner in which he puts his materials heaven and earth and all living as well as dead phenomena are the heritage of the painter but for every inch of canvas that is made immortal there are acres that in being only saleable sell the buyer of them and make unbeautiful for ever the walls of the uncritical philistines in like manner for every book that finds an abidingplace in the heart of man there are waggonfuls that after serving the temporary purposes of commerce fall decently asleep in the company of equally aomnific bedfellows on the shelves of polyglot libraries and other accommodating dustholes we do not see that we need complain of this if the majority of books iust necessarily sink out of human memory it is a distinct merit if any of them fairly serve their temporary purpose like dozens of stories published during the present year blonidel parva will serve its allotted span perhaps more eieutly hlau some of its fellows and then be heard of no more,ovel
B6938,['9415989'],  peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff

B8889,"['4853285', '9455565']",  oswald cray qneald cay by mro henry wood edinburgh a  c black if mrs henry wood had done nothing else as a novelist she would still be entitled to the credit of having proved that two qualities which used to be thought incompatible may be sometimes found in conjunction she is at once amusing and prosy it is never an impossibility to get through one of her books but at the same time the reader always wishes he could throw overboard a good deal of unnecessary ballast unfortunately the least attractive of the two characteristics seems on the whole to be increasing with the exception of lord oakburns daughters which was relieved by the originality of its plot nothing that she has written has been so good as her first novel and notwithstanding our recollections of  verners pride we are disposed to put  oswald cray last in order of merit as well as in order of time mrs woods successes and failures may perhaps be attributed to one and the same cause she has an extraordinary affection for small details and up to a certain point her attachment is perfectly well placed when wisely used they impart additional reality to a story and give immense assistance to the reader in forming a clear conception of the people with which it is concerned but then there must be some care displayed in the selection of them all facts have not an equal value as illustrations of human character and the fault we have to find with mrs wood is that she persists in assuming that they have take for example her descriptions of womens dress we quite agree with her in thinking that the insertion of them may add great life and vividness to the portrait of a heroine but then they must aim at reproducing in the mind of the reader something of that general effect which exists in the mind of the writer in other words they must be real descriptions not a inere inventory of the contents of the heroines wardrobe in mis woods hands howevers they aplroach ivery closely to this latter type hiere are onlly a few of the instances which occur in  oswald cray carolines morning robe was of white muslin and blue ribbons carolino wore the same rich dress that she had worn in the afternoon but the high body had been exchanged for a low one the custom for dinner at dr davenals no doubt if the reader were a young lady going to stay at the house for a day or two and uncertain what gowns she should take with her this last piece of information might be of some service otherwise it is difficult to see what is the precise good it is to do him so with the other heroine isara is in evening dress a black gauze with a little white net quilting on the low body and sleeves or again sara wears a black crape robea little edging of white only on its low body and sleeves details of this kind might perhaps be interesting to people who know the wearer of the garments in question and had possibly seen her in them already and they would therefore be quite appropriate in a letter from one young lady to another of which the subject was the appearancon a given occasion of a common friend in that case the latter on being informed that  dear emily wore that sweet silk would be able to combine the subject and the predicate and thus obtain a distmet idea of the dear emily in the  sweet silk but the male and therefore ignorant reader needs to have his imagination assisted and some clearer notion conveyed to him of the effect of this happy combination nor again is every incident which may occur in real life suitablo for the purposes of fiction the art of the novelist is especially shown in the work of selection and combina tion mrs wood however seems quite ntisfied that so long as she is reproducing fcts she is doing afi that can be required of her a t petooswaldcray is devoted to the teacey of dr dayenals serant and for some time we are nstantly on the lookout for some disastrous consequence which is to flow from his unpleasant habits of reading letters opening desks secreting papers and inventing false charges but in the end nothing comes of it all ilia villainy is simply purposeless and the only reason mrs wood can assign for giving so much space to the narration of it is that it is but the simple truththe recital of all episode in real life she forgets that in fiction we look for something more satisfactory than the halfknowledge with which we are often obliged to put up when we are dealing with actual events we expect to see the connexion between actious and motives made plain and the moral history of crime traced out without this a novel would have no more interest than a report of a trial at the assizes with the additional disadvantage of being only an invention after all it is this newspaper style of writing which mrs wood seems especially to aim at and some parts of  oswald cray  might have been taken almost verbatirn from the notebook of a pennyaliner during the dull season thus in describing a railway accident she takes occasion to explain with most unnecessary minuteness how the news of its occurrence was delayed in its passage to the next station and this is the fashion in which she does it the telegraph clerk was a young man namlied james eales it was his duty to receive the messages and ini due course he oughlt to lave received the one from l1ildon siagnifving that the expected train called ill familiar terms at hallinglanm the seven oclock train though it camie in five minutes sooner hadl duly quitted hildon this message was due somewhere about twenty three minutes to seven and it came this evening as usual quite punctually no sooner had it been received than james eales who wanted to absent himself for a short while onl an errand to the town asked one of the men to take his place other messages might be expected relating to the trains not to speak of private messages always liable to come and thc inaii took the plaee accordingly as eales was going out the mani hlose nanie was williams called after huin to klnow whetlhr tilm trniin was signalled eales thought lie meant the downtraiii wlhosl signal was nearly due lanl replied  nlo not yet 13blt inl point of fact willianmis had alludled to thc uptrain from 11ildon which had been sigllallel that man was an accurate timekeoper it wanted two or three minutes yet to the siglnalling of the downtrail and lie would not have beeii likely from this very accuracy to inquire whether that message had comne it not being due eales who did not possess the like innate accuracy and was besides in a hurry to depart confused the quebtion and took it to allude to the downtirain now even if this mistake of the clorks had really causedl the accident this would be an absurdly verbose way of telling the story but as it happens it has simlly no connexion with it and the whole of this wonderful paragraph is apparently introduced solely for the sake of the moral lesson with which it concludes it is through these mistakes which arc caused half by carelessness half by what may be almoot called unavoidable misapprehension that accidents occur it did not lead to the accident in tis cwe the italics to borrgw mrs woods newspaper style arc our own but it has led to many a one williams ought to have said  is the uptrail signalled saying whiat lie did say ifs the train signalled eales should have answered time uptrain is signalled not the down mrs wood does not content herself1 ho1 e ever with giving extracts fromn imagiflaly newspapers she turns to good account her cuttings from real ones and actually introduces the death of the

one night all would be well more than ten pages in all are devoted to this subject if the object were to fill up space we should call this sort of writing bookmaking of the lowest order but as each of the three volumes is considerably beyond the customary length we are forced to suppose that the author imagines that her work is thereby invested with the dignity of an historical romance we should not speak thus severely of oswald cray if mrswood had not already shown herself capable of something very different but it would be doing a real unkindness to the author of  east lynne  to allow her to waste her undoubted talents in the way she has done in the present work without at least making an effort to arrest her downward progress for the faults we have pointed out are not in this instance redeemed by any counterbalancing melits it is impossible to take any interest in the characters of the story except perhaps in sara davenaland in her only because we are told that she has the marvellous gift of being able to take her seat in a crowded omnibus  with quiet selfpossession  while for oswald cray himself every reader must feel a dislike approaching closely to detestation lie suspects a man of the highest character whom he has known all his life of committing a coldblooded murder and he breaks off his engagement with miss davenal not for any fault of her own but simply because he cherishes this groundless distrust of her father it is true that at length he discovers his mistake as by a very little trouble he might have done at the beginning and graciously takes the young lady back into his affections but even then he is only sorry that he should have been mistaken not in the least penitent for having acted basely and yet notwithstanding all this we are constantly hearing of his noble pride his grand selfreliance his scorn of everything mean or dishonourable so that our natural lislike is immeasurably increased by finding that he is presented to us as a hero in some of her other works mrs wood has been decidedly happy in the humorous characters but this element is almost entirely wanting in  oswald cray perhaps it was considered undesirable that a story which originally appeared in a semireligious periodical should have too large an infusion of the comic element we regret the omission because mrs benn the housekeeper at oswald crays chambers shows consideiable capacity of being amusing if we were allowed to become more intimate with her in one respect we are bound to admit mrs wood shows signs of improvement she writes less stilted english she still occasionally makes her heroes and heroines say i deem when the rest of the world would say think but this is now only the exception instead of being as formerly the rule perhaps after a time she may even learn that in speaking of a clergyman it is not customary to call him the i reverend m1r stephenson i i  oswald cray by mrs henry wood 3 vols edinburgh black oswald cray appeared in the pages of good words a periodical in which a writer of fiction is placed under some limitations whether mrs wood has not felt herself at ease and liberty or whether she is suffering under the fatigue of writing so many long stories with scarcely an interval of rest between them we do not know but it is certain that in  oswald cray her usual skill in weaving a story pleasantly and naturally deserts her oswald cray is dull and long drawn out the incident upon which the interest centres is so weak that the reader is inclined to resent it dr davenal is a celebrated physician in a country town with a widespread reputation for skill and benevolence sara davenal the heroine is his eldest daughter a welldrawn character as also is dr davenal oswald cray the hero is a young man who has been pecked off the family nest by his fathers second marriage and he is struggling to make his way as an engineer he loves sara davenal and has ascertained that she cares for him but before he has formally proposed for her to her father it so happens that a railway accident has injured a whimsical old lady a friend of the doctors and a connexion of oswalds she dies under the influence of chloroform administered hy dr davenals partner in spite of his prohibition the partner is oswald crays halfbrother mark to save the professional reputation of mark the doctor accepts the blame and responsibility of the act he waa out of the room when the choloroform was administered and the old lady had insisted upon having mark cray to perform the operation when her will comes to be read it appears that dr davenal is her heir she has left mm her whole fortune oswald cray had heard the doctor say that it would be fatal to give chloroform to lady oswald he jumps to the diabolical conclusion that a thoroughly good man of proved high principle has wilfully mismanaged the case and in fact murdered his friend for the sake of her money a malignant mischiefmaking manservant certainly insinuates the suspicion but oswald cray readily receives it he immediately decides that the daughter of dr davenal is not worthy to be his wife and he withdraws from her acquaintance in the most selfish and coldblooded manner without a word of explanation dr davenal resigns all lady oswalds money to the relations and thia act of delicate disinterestedness confirms the amiable oswald crays suspicions trouble comes to dr davenal his eldest son commits some mysterious crime which breaks his fathers heart and takes every farthing of his savings to avert the consequences to sara davenal he leaves directions what to do after his death but only vaguely explains the reasons crushed to the earth with grief for the death of her father and shame for the guilt of her brother which she can only surmise sara davenal is left in poverty and perplexity with the added sorrow of oswald crays desertion from some words which she misunderstands she fancies that oswald cray is cognizant of her brothers guilt whatever it may be and her answer confirms his previous idea that dr davenal had wilfully risked the life of lady oswald the treacherous manservant endeavours to widen the breach meanwhile mark cray oswalds halfbrother enters into a bubble mining speculation in which he persuades his brother to invest it turns out a disgraceful swindle and oswald has to bear his own halfbrothers disgrace as best he can capt davenal whose misdeeds have been the cause of so much woe comes back after some yearsthe husband of a rich heiress and in a very jaunty frame of mind it seems from his own showing that he had forged his fathers name to bills for a large amount and his father had redeemed them but the young man is very little ashamed and lays the blame on a companion he however frankly tells the facts to oswald cray thinking to set matters straight between him and his sister in the course of their conversation the truth of lady oswalds case comes to light and oswald cray condescends to ask sara to forgive him the mystery is for too slight to bear the procrastination in which mrs wood loves to indulge the reader is weary long before the difficulty is cleared up the collapse of the wheal bang mino is cleverly described but aa a whole the story is tedious neal the wicked servant is a weak and ineffective villain miss bettina the deaf aunt becomes tiresome caroline the foolish pretty young wife of mark cray is cleverly drawn in her adversity but she is not interesting oswald cray is inferior to mrs woods novels,ovel
B8270,['8589370'],  the lawyers daughter tiie lawyers daughter by frank trollope 3 vols london skeet 1873 fc though we learn from the titlepage of  the lawyers daughter that its author has already written no less than four other novels we regret to say that up to the present time so great was our ignorance of contemporary literature that we were wholly unawrare of his existence after reading the lawyers daughter we are by no means sure that we have any great cause for rejoicing at the enlightenment it affords us what is to be said of an author who gravely and without apology introduces his readers to venice in the seventeenth century and to all the paraphernalia of cloaks and swtords masks and daggers which have been the undisputed property of the london journal since the days of monk lewis  there is a melancholy helpless heroism about the action which at once commands our respect and moves our pity how little appreciation of the time in which he lives must an author have to whom the historical novel seems still a fitting vehicle for amusement or instruction we could scarcely have been more surprised at being asked to read a new  grand cyrus or a fresh chronicle of amadis of gaul than at finding an author as yet unknown to fame and we venture to presume young offering to a public that feeds on mudie a story which uses again all the devices and machinations familiar in the days of anne radcliffe or g p r james quite oblivious of the oftenquoted advice of corinna to pindar about sowing with thc hand and not with the whole sack mr trolloxe calmly reproduces in one single work all the stage effects of an entire literary generation bloody tyrants shameful murders vows of vengeance missing documents entrapped maidens duels and combats of six incessant hairbreadth escapes bravoes outlaws monks all these and other familiar machinery are to be found in the lawyers daughter virtue triumphs over vice too in thc end in the famous old fashion but even this attraction will not wtc are afraid ensure to mr trollope a large number of admiring readers were mr trollope a much better writer than he is he could not force the british public to an interest in this sort of thing now elsewhere it is different oeeasionally if georg ebers likes to devote himself to the manufacture of old egyptian and carly christian novels he knows that in scholastic germany he addresses a larg circle of readers who will like him all the better for thc fact that there is no one else living who could combine the ability to tell a good story with such appalling erudition if on the other hand m xavier dc montepin or paul feval likes to drop back a few centuries and to clothe his  hollow puppets  in some more graceful garb than ours  if the eighteenth century delight m amadce achard or the sixteenth ponson du terrail these authors know their pappenheimers and they possess so strongly the art of storytelling that they must always be vivacious and readable  their characters wear well the garments of aa ancient epoch and if they do not differ much from the parisian of today they move about with thc theatrical easo and grace which he can wear so well either before the world or at the bal de it opera but we in england must frankly admit ourselves inferior to france in storytelling to germany in erudition  in other words we want nowadays both the qualities which best excuse the historical novel as well as the willingness to read it our writers of the present day will not take the trouble which is essential to such a work  they will not labour like scott or thackeray or bulwer lytton and they do not produce a  quentin durward an  esmond or even a  last days of pompeii they are not of course to bo blamed for doing the work that suits them best and we should be very sorry to think that england boasted a miss mulbach among her novelists the epoch of the historical novel is as far as we can see passed away in england and  the lawyers daughter is scarcely likely to succeed when  romola  failed yet there is not wanting a certain feeling of pleasure in an age of robertson and jules verne of teacup and saucer and the fairy tales of science in finding some one bold enough to take delight in the good oldfashioned elements of romance and naive enough to hope for a sympathetic and attentive audience one quotation will be enough to give an idea of the work presently

while the marches spoke there might bo seen a slight degree of nervous agitation in the features of the count de st felix he seemed to press hia lips hard and though hand that held his sword was

though swords crossed this sort of thing ought only to make its appearance now in the weekly instalments of some obscure periodical were it as veil written as if it were by the elder dumas himself it would not go down but when it appears in a threevolume novel by an evidently inexperienced writer the anachronism is only too glaringly absurd wc should like to warn mr frank trollope that nobody now cares about old venice or the doge or the council of ten about moonlight squares and sombre streets about mysterious appointments desperate duels and the fierce hates and fiercer loves which charmed our grandfathers and grandmothers neither the melancholy lover nor the wicked baron would be tolerated now for a single instant thc lantern jaws of the one and the buff boots of the other will not meet even with the kindly respect due to their dignified antiquity but only with ribald laughter or unconcealed indifference no one now cares to walk in that imagination street where thackerays j j loved to stray thc street where lovely ladies look from balconies where cavaliers strike mandolins and draw swords and engage where long processions pass and venerable hermits with long beards bless the kneeling people where the rude soldiers swaggering through the place with flags and halberts and fife and dance seize the slim waists of the daughters of the people and bid thc pifferan play to their dancing who cares now for though fate of manfroni the onehanded monk for abellino though bravo of venice  whose eyes moisten now for thaddeus of warsaw or  looking on darkness see with horror the hideous effigy of death which makes udolpho terrible if mr trollope wishes to be read he had better either follow the example of his more distinguished namesake or make a hero of a gasmeter or a guardsman the path of literature which has been hallowed by thc tread of rhoda broughton he may not hope to enter on success there seems to be reserved for women but let him devote whatever talents he

selfsufficiency which he imagined to be his before he married her the coldblooded manner in which he addresses himself to this task regardless in his allabsorbing egoism of the possible consequences to the woman whose absolutely unselfish devotion he thus repays is cleverly and forcibly described the unequal struggle however does not last long and an attack of malignant scarlet fever which leaves him physi jally blind at the same time removes the scales which had darkened his spiritual eyesight intellectual pride is crushed and love is triumphant the stoic has thrown his philosophy to the winds and sits at the feet of his wife in the school of love here the book ends too abruptly for those readers who are interested in mr charles godfrey and cicely gordon both welldrawn charactersthe latter perhaps a little overdrawn apart from one or two vulgarisms which ladywriters seem unable to resist putting into the mouths of athletic young gentlemen from the universities such as  awfully down in the mouth c the style of the whole book is far above the level of the average novelist but it sins on the side of extravagance miss craiks novel is remarkable first on account of its title the quaint and certainly rather pretty name she has allotted to her heroine and secondly for the adoption of the gossiping or confidential style a proceeding which on social grounds we are inclined to resent whatever convenience or virtue may be latent in  i think  and  you know the confidential method of telling a story seems generally a poor substitute for making the characters tell their own tale and we prefer to base our estimate of them in novels as in real life upon their own words and actions rather than to accept assertions about their character from a candid friend neither is an author presumably upon such terms of acquaintance with the public as to expect a ready response to her friendly overtures of intimacy with this exception and the grand defect of wasting her heroine coram populo with the unromantic malady of hipdisease the story such as it is is fairly told we learn how a fashionable young lady much addicted to coquetry and somewhat brusque in her style of repartee is reduced by bodily infirmities to so gracious an attitude of mind as to accept thankfully the addresses of an admirer who plays benedick to her beatrice and to whom she at first disdains to accord her heart the gentleman who is as rough a lover as the lady is a petulant mistress begins with a strong aversion and contempt for the frivolity and coquetry of miss trevelyan but when she is laid upon a sick bed and a long convalescence gives him an opportunity of observing her character  swelling pity  does for him what it did for duncan gray and the mutual antipathy between these results in a cordial attachment there are some layfigures of no interest who fill the subordinate parts and this excessively domestic story is brought within the modest space of two volumes to an end where most writers would probably have thought of beginning we may remark as another peculiarity which might be worth the notice of intending authors tending to save much labour on both sides that the reader whose imaginative powers have never been pandered to by any uncertainty as to the events recorded is requested to supply that source of interest by  finishing the story as he likes this suggestion might be indefinitely improved upon a blank volume to be filled up as one chose would possibly be preferable to works of so slender a calibre,ovel

B8273,['4363494'],  reviews of books rachel ray mr trollope is one of the few novelists who make us forget the labour of criticism in our enjoymient of their books he throws off his novels with the ease of a man writing to some friend the latest gossip of his circle and seems as much amused with the foibles and humours of his characters as if he were laugghing at persons he had seen and heard and not at the creatures of his imagination this characteristic of his writing he has nowhere displayed more strikingly than in the novel before us it is almost a laugh from beginning to end marked here and there with touches of pathos effectively thrown in and though at times verging on caricature only violating the truth of nature to the extent of a slight exaggeration without plot and almost without incident we are carried through the book by the writers exuberant spirits and his way of turning to us the quizzical side of his characters but still more by the power with which he realises the manners the habits and speech of english life in their homeliest garb they are real beings who play their part in his story we have met them have spoken and lived with them we have sat with them in their houses have walked with them over the fields watched with them the setting sun by the churchyard stile and shared their loves and jealousies their weaknesses and their virtues we have seen before this cottage interior with its halfdozen books with gilt leaves arranged in shapes on the small round table where also is deposited the spangled mat of wondrous brightness made of short white sticks of glhss strung together with its shells and china figures on the chimneypiece the birdcage without a bird the old sofa the old armchair and carpet and the old round mirror over the fireplace we have some experience of mrs tappitts nianceuvres to convert a teaparty into a ball and win her lord and master by beautifully fine degrees to consent to one expense after another till the accumulation involves as an absolute necessity a still further outlay for which he is to be consoled by one of her best beefsteak puddings and who that has not been buried all his life in unredeemed bricks and mortar has not met mrs sturt the farmers wife who likes a young man who does the thing thats honest and is willing to lend her friendly aid to bring two young people together again who have been separated by the stupid interference of soured or silly meddlers  with such traits does  rachel ray abound and if it is not to be ranked though we doubt this with mr trollopes best works he has written nothing which will give his readers more thorough delight the design of his tale is to show how excessively mischievous overgood people may make themselves and that there is a practical malignity even about religion itself when it is pushed to an unnatural extreme with this view mr trollope begins by placing before us a lady very good and very weak whom he describes as one of those women who cannot grow alone as standard trees but for whom the support and warmth of some wall some paling some post is absolutely necessary who in their growth will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach while he lived mrs ray leaned upon her husband but on his death leaving her with two daughters the eldest of whom dorothea took after her father and was stem sober and steady the widow  immediately married herself to this girl who became thenceforth the prop against which she could grow but in time dorothea shared and became widow prime at the end of a year returning at the end of that time to her mothers cottage  black and stiff and stern to be her mothers prop once more mr trollope describes this womans character with great gusto prim and tidy by nature  it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance therefore she was rough with weeds her caps were  lumpy heavy full of woe and clean only as decency might requirenot nicely clean with feminine care her dress too was rough and black and clingingdisagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any wcmin which is worn day after day through all hours though naturally welllooking her desire had been to e ugly forbidding attractive almost repulsive so thats in ver truth she might be known to be a widow indeed she was t8ilf no bp

of future happiness on which her heart was set against this lady as against a wall whose support was  strong but not at all times pleasant leaned mrs ray to her own satisfaction but not quite to that of her younger daughter rachel who was neither weak nor stern but willing to take such pleasure as life offered her disliked mrs primes dorcas meetings and displayed  a little wickedness now and then to the extent perhaps of a vain walk into baslehurst on a summer evening a little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and whom she had seen a yawn in church or a word of complaint as to the length of the second sunday sermon the reader soon finds that in one of her walks rachel has seen  a young man this fact explodes like a bombshell in the cottap at braggs end and mrs ray holding the lupine theory with regard to youths of the opposite sex we see that what with her timidity on this score and mrs primes uncompromising enmity to happi ness of any kind rachers relations with the  young man from the brewery will be as little pleasant as it is possible for the two widows to make them but luke rowan the wolf in question is a youth of strong decision of character he has made up his mind to love rachel and that rachel shall love him which the girl is willing enough to do the day after mrs tappitts ball luke finds his way to braggs end and startles mrs rays confidence in her theory by the frankness with which he confesses his love and asks permission to visit rachel but above all by the way in which he takes his tea quite like a steady young man indeed she says defending herself against mrs primes remonstrances  he drank three large cups and if as rachel says he alajoes  to church regularly i dont know why we are to judge him anw say that hes anything out of the way the bickerings between mrs ray and her eldest daughter on this subject are described with the nicest discrimination of character and with an undercurrent of great humouir what is a higher testimony to mr trollopes power is the skill with which he develops rachels character in t conflict between the widows and the touches of purely natural and beautiful emotion by which he wins us to love her the dialogue between rachel and mrs ray after mrs prime has left them in which the girl tries to draw from her mother what luke has sai about her while she ran over to the farmers to fetch cream for the tea is one of the most charming of the many exquisite passages m these volumes mrs ray  so inconsequent in her mental workings so shandypated that it did not occur to her that an entirely new view of luke rowans purposes had been exposed to rach during this visit of mrs primes and not realising the fact that she had authorised rachel to regard luke as her lover while rachel remembers every word and begins to think that with hex mothers leave an intimacy with luke would be very pleasant but what was it that he did say mamma 9that is if you dow think it wrong to tell me i hardly know but i dont snppose it can be wrong for no young man could have spoken nicer and it made me happy to hear himso it did for the moment oh mamma do tell me and rachel kneeled down before her  wellhe said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen did he mamma and the girl clng closer to her mother a she heard the pleasant words but i oughtnt to tell you such nonsense as that and then 1h said that he wanted to come out here and see you andandand it is simply this that he meant to ask you to be his sweeheart if i would let him   and what did you say mamma  i couldnt eay anything because you came back bat you told dolly  mrs prime that you would be glad to ae him whenever he might choose to come here did i yes you said he was welcome to come whenever he plemb and that you believed him to be a very good young man and so i do why should he be anything else  i dont say that hes anything else but mamma well my dear what shall i say to him if he does ask me that question  h has called me by my name two or three times and spoken to me m though he wanted me to like him if he does say anything to like that what shall i answer    if you think you dont like him well enough you must toll him so of course c yes of course i must then rachel was silent for a mia or two she had not as yet received the full answer which o desired in such an alternative as that which her mother had southwest gested we may say that she would have known how to frame b answer to the young man without any advice from her mother bo there was another alternative as to which she thought it

slight sketches though they are the interview between mrs tappitt mrs rowan and mrs ray when the two former ladies visit the widow to represent to her the impropriety of a marriage between luke and rachel is again a proof of the ability with which the author holds his characters in hand and brings out their several idiosyncracies but perhaps the best thing in the novel is the pertinacity with which luke rowan deterniines either to drive old tappitt out of the brewery or compel him to brew good beer though it was a sour and muddy stream that flowed from his vats a beverage disagreeable to the palate and very cold and uncomfortable to the stonach tappitt made fifteen hundred a year out of it and to be told by a youngster that he did not know how to brew good beer was an indignity he could not put up with but the choleric old brewer is no match for luke cool and resolute at all hazards to brew good beer for baslehurst even if he is obliged to build a new brewery he threatens to do this and goes so far as to purchase the requisite ground then mrs tappitt seeing ruin staring her and her dauighters in the face urges her husband to take the thousand per annuim which luke has offered him in exchange for his interest in the old firm  till after much resistance and many resolutions to fight the battle out tappitt comes home from the dragon one night much the worse from eating  that accursed fish  and the next day sick in stomach and racked with headache lies utterly at his wifes mercy and consents to take lukes offer the scene in which this occurs is a capital domestic interior in mr trollopes best style if we are to find fault with this delightful story we might object that the artifice by which the stream of rachels love is disturbed is improbable that her mother would have been advised to make her write the letter which for a time clouds her joy and makes it doubtful whether the lover who broke in on her almost solitary and very humble life with such a sunburst of undreamt of happinessadvised too by the clergyman who had given such a sensible judgement on the question whether it would be sinful if she went to mrstappitts ballis notwethink likely that lovingluke as she did she would write it is less probable for rachel has a will of her own but that lukehonest straightforward manly lover as he isshould be put off by it should not feel the love that throbs under its air of prudence and attribute the love to rachel and the prudence to her stupid counsellors is less likely still but as this letter gives us two volumes when but for it we could only have had one we shall not quarrel with it and after all nothing is so flexible as human nature and to say that it will do this or will not do that under given circumstances is to forget how often it acts in contradiction to itself and again how often acts that seem to be contradiction on the surface are logical enough if we could minutely weigh the feelings from which they spring,ovel
B4945,['8524933'],  gentleman verschoyle gentleman verhoyle a novel by laura m lane in three volumes london sampson low marston low and searle 1875 miss grey the heros aunt dora acts as the authoresss

nephew went to college and found  the newlyarisen tractarian party it would be an offence against all the canons of speculative chronology to affix a more recent date than 1845 to this epoch of mr maurice verschoyles career so that his biographer wrote or at any rate finished and corrected her work at the mature age of seventy or upwards she ismorally not bicipitally a muscular christian and her sprightly humour enthusiastic practical aspirations and fresh healthy tone of mind speak volumes for the preservative influence of the tenets of the sect when held by an old maid in very easy circumstances the book is written in  the gently didactic manner peculiar to maiden ladies and is a little too highly spiced with pious reflections but in spite of this and sundry faults of detail the book is pleasing and full of promise in fact if a sudden reverse of fortune obliges miss dora grey to take to novelwriting as a business and she will only deign to take the advice of her juniors she will by the time she is ninety or a hundred very likely have attained considerable popularity it is melancholy from a novel readers point of view to reflect how few sins there are after all for sensationmongers to work upon and how meagrely and samely stocked is the worlds chamber of horrors modern fiction has rung over and over again all the possible changes on themes of mystery and crime and is rapidly running through the impossible it is therefore quite a treat to the jaded reader or critic to turn aside from the beaten highroad of sensationalism to a quiet bypath where no fatal secret hangs heavy in the air no crime to speak of stains the sward so that with imagination 4lruined we can admire any delicate unobtrusive beauties which quiet humour and kindly sentiment offer on the way  gentleman verschoyle is eminently fr from the epidemic taint of the novels of the period positively a case of manslaughter by a railway company is the only crime necessary to the progress of the plot and  gentleman verschoyles only exhibitions of active muscularity are leaping a hedge which be could not see over vol i p 230 and knocking down a factory bully vol ii p 288 the avowed object of the story is to illustrate the moral power of the spirit of love the magical power of sweet affections in a novel we venture to think that the constant ascription of all good influences to god is as ut of place as would be elaborate psychological analysis now as miss grey gives us three or four conversations with a very worthy vicar not to mention a short sermon of his she might with advantage have made these passages the vehicle of her religious theories and left the rest of the story to point its own moral without explicit indications of divine interference there is plenty of room to moralise without venturing outside the sphere of human motives and mundane circumstances the portrayal and comparison of appearances and the discovery of deeper appearances hidden behind the more prominent is enough for the novelist without plunging into the abyss of realities though we cannot agree with miss greys religious theories nor think them very consistent still a form of religion which endeavours to accommodate itself to human feelings and institutions is more bearable in novel or elsewhere than the more bilious or hysterical varieties the hero  was no  saint no unnatural specimen of hothouse piety he displayed no unhealthy aptitude for religious phraseology a very mild little clergyman who remonstrated with him for leading his class of artisans upon the dangerous quicksands of poetry and science is promptly suppressed miss grey seems to have a suspicion that she  may have paused too often to moralise and prays her readers if they find this and other faults  forgive the prosiness of an old womans story my venerable madam permit a comparatively young critic to say that if you will be so very juvenile in your ideas if you advocate imprudent marriages and higher education of women if you indulge occasionally in slang and in your views about society and politics are altogether so unconventionally liberal we must forget your age and imagine you to be a young lady who on her debut in the role of authoress claims indulgence for her untempered enthusiasm and her inexperience the plot is straightforward and fairly compact miss lane we prefix the maiden title under correction has displayed considerable power of concentration in the delineation of some of her characters of five principal characters a laudably short allowance four are clearly conceived and their individuality well brought out by a judicious treatment of delicate shades of colour agatha and dora grey are introduced as heiresses living with their uncle a wealthy city man dora is plain and longs  for a full life  of practical usefulness and spiritual and intellectual advancement agatha a stately beauty  born to fill a high position is all for society and admiration a wealthy relation vulgar but fashionable opportunely turns up and brings her out dora finds a lover in a young curate only to lose him by death early in the book before agatha makes a lovematch with a handsome wellborn guardsman with no money only two hundred pounds of his own and an allowance of six hundred ayear from sir joyce before they have been many years married philip verschoyle is filled in a railway accident and the hero is born immediately dora henceforth lives with her sister and helps to rear the widows sole remaining treasure in her village home mother and son are devotedly attached and she hopes and longs to have him always by her and make him an idle  gentleman  like his father but maurice soon exhibits irrepressible energy of character and a longing for fellowship and a wider field for action the gradual dissipation of the fond mothers illusions as her darlings manly independence step by step developes itself is remarkably well depicted just before the young enthusiast y g for wide human interests is retuning from oxford where he is chilled by indifference or narrow mindedness on all sides his mother takes it into her head to patronise an invalid young lady of better birth than mrs verschoyle but who is niece to the principal farmer on the estate she somewhat rudely insists upon her paying her a long visit not intending to treat her as an equel nor dreaming that her noble boy would fall in love with a farmers niece of course he does his mother overhears their mutual avowal just as maurice starts for gibraltar of which a clever but rather irksome description is given her unkindness drives the girl to run away to town and the vicar recalls maurice to vindicate her character his mother mortified at seeing him staunch to his love promptly disowns him the police find and he marries hope the young couple struggle on in lodgings maurice working for wages at a factory with a view to becoming a civil engineer eventually he becomes a partner and on his being run over and nearly killed his mother is reconciled to him it will be seen from this rough outline that the main interest of the story is of that elevated kind which depends on the natural development of character under the influence of ordinary circumstances agatha verschoyle we venture to think has not a sufficiently coherent individuality we fancied that she was so transformed by lher love for her husband and for her child that we wvere unprepared for her outrageous conduct with respect to hope in other respects the btory runs smoothly enough the byplay of which we have purposely given nu sketclb contains some nice touches of pathos though the principles of the book are advanced liberalism there appears throughoutta staunch support of the established church and we fancy that we can detect a lingering reverence for  blood  and high position canon kingsleys views were essentially a compromise and here we have him in petticoats maurice is intended to marry beneath him and become in externals at least a conmmon workman  but he marries a thorough lady as well born as himself and the  workmans wages on which hec and his wife subsist for four years are found on calculation to be two hundred pounds ayear or more if ladies choose to describe pugilistic matters they should either study fistiana or get male advice on the subject so as to avoid the error of suggesting that the scientific use of the fists is likely to be taught by  lessons from monsieur de paris in the noble art of the fence  vol ii p 291 when the nominal narrator leaves the room in the middle of a conversation but still reports it verbatim without a word of explanation whence her knowledge is derived the ludicrous idea that she listened at the keyhole irresistibly obtrudes itself see vol i p 252 such little crudities will it is to be hoped disappear with practice and as the authoress theories become more mature and congruous we trust she will widen her sphere of usefulness by leaving the religious element out of her compositions as nmany earnest christians have been content to do before her with no other alteration than the erasure of a multitude of devout but unnecessary sentiments the attractiveness of the novel before us might have been doubled there is surely a consciousness of a reserve of power and abundance of material in a writer who depicts her hero when his love is hidden away in london leaving the matter in the hands of the detective police and at the advice of his old tutor occupying his mind with a course of history here is material for three volumes deliberately sacrificed is this meant for a sly thrust at certain popular novelists  whether or no the resolution to resist such a fascinating temptation is to be highly commended we see no reason why miss lane should not take a bolder flight and try her hand on some more complex characters but we advise her not to repeat so bold an experiment as the impersonation of an old lady of seventy years personally we have a prejudice against conducting a narrative by deputy as also against such devices for simplifying the construction of a plot as  extract from my diary,ovel

porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both be dont talk so dont talk so tellme quietlydear dear mother tell me quietly hush hush i am going to tell you she threatened me on her deathbed if i thwarted her she said she would come to me from the other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead

itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

B5981,"['8961362', '6796996', '6830469']",  sister teresa new novels by george moore fisher unwin mb moore gave no hint if we mistake not in the first edition of  evelyn innes that he intended to write a sequel so that although there is no suggestion of it there is still a possibility that  sister teresa may be followed by a third volume to complete the tragedy of evelyn inness career the need certainly seems to arise for it for the end arrived at in sister teresa is distinctly a case of bathos it will be remembered that evelyn inns was j represented in the first book as a person in o whom sensuality and idealism were constantly struggling for the mastery and there the struggle was left undecided in sister teresa the struggle still goes on only to cease at the end not because any solution has been come to but because evelyn has been ill and she finds that she has not the physical courage to escape from the convent as she had meant to do and that she can do no more than settle down to an inert vegetable existence as a music mistress in a convent school a dead soulless existence is undoubtedly a frequent outcome of such a struggle as there was in evelyns nature but it is no solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great novel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a novel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are traces everywhere of a certain affectation of celticism mr moores recentlyfound celtic aspirations are of course notorious he has not succeeded in keeping them out of his novel there is a passage on p gg   he must go with her to the pure country to the woods and to the places where the invisible ones whom the druids knew etc  wandering in the woods and underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore novelist

blank sheet to disarm criticism i now there is this peculiarity in the work before us that then is too much plot in it tins is at all events an original fault for most novelists cry out in despair over  thc difficulty of finding any sort of prop on which to hang their fancies and their characters miss mary cecil  hay however has a speciality for plots so that they j crop up on all sides and get entangled one within another therefore whether we admit that the story j is well conceived or not it certainly does possess that j unusual feature o a substratum which so many novels j are without there is so much mystery so many characters and so much complication that it would j have been really kind to have given us a bradshaws guide to the principal stations in the book but thero is not even any heading to the chapters for onr direction we are allowed at the beginning a brief glimpse of the old squire upon wrhose legacy the main foundation of the story rests  but the real hero is his son and heir scot monk ton who is introduced to us as young and handsome and  with hair almost the colour of though old bronze velvet cushions  upon which he is wont to recline as he rehearses his favourite airs on a silver cornet there are marble steps to the door of his house picture galleries containing priceless works of art vast suites of lofty rooms luxurious meals a retinue of many servants and the usual splendour with which a lively imagination can so readily surround us the highbred calm and repose which all this wealth is supposed to engender is one day unpleasantly disturbed by the arrival of one monsieur philippe sourdet a frenchman who asks leave to be allowed to visit the picture gallery bringing a note of introduction from a cousin of the squires scots keen eye detects at a glance that this man is not a gentleman but his  innate courtesy  leads him to show sourdet all his family portraits himself and also to invite him to join the  midday meal  in the diningroom at kingswood which we are told was  a scene of luxury and pomp which caused the frenchman a feeling oddly compounded of both envy and selfgratulation  and minute after minute his manner grew more painfully obsequious while the welltrained servants wondered curiously why this strange man had not been left to lunch alone why indeed  monsieur sourdet professes to hold a family secret which he wishes to sell before revealing it for 10000z and as scot refuses with manly scorn to have any dealings with him he becomes the bete noire of the family in conjunction with a detected poacher who owes the squire a grudge the heros obstinacy is overstrained but the more commonplace characters are pleasantly drawn miss hayr succeeds much better with her wellconducted people than with her villains aunt michal for instance is often rather amusing kenneth the fevered poet and playwriter though an improbable character is interesting sometimes and well conceived whilst the little heroine 1 doris egerton is really very pleasant and natural with her flowers and her two attachments though we must protest against two sets of lovescenes with the same interchange of affectionate epithets from the same heroine to her two successive lovers there is material enough for two or three ordinary novels in these three volumes the first plot gives us the mystery of the frenchman and the family secret the second the story of the real heir to the estate and of his little boy willy who is on the whole very prettily described though quite an impossible child in real wic then there are some country neighbours a mr and miss chamberlain who have also a mystery which does not appear to us to have the slightest bearing upon thc rest of the story but to be thrown in by the wa as an evidence of superfluous force this is surely wanton waste for the author could easily have woven another threevolume novel out of this mere episode there is also a family of leveys who do not seem to have any business at all and are only in the way but whose income house dress habits and conversation are given us from time to time with unflinching perseverance throughout the book in spite however of many drawbacks there are stirring incidents well described a railway accident a storm a fire and very many more miss hay possesses remarkable fertility of invention and crowded and entangled as it is 4 the squires legacy is better worth reading than threefourths of the novels which we arc expected to order the tone of thc book is highminded throughout and however improbable some of the characters may be there is no  trail of the serpent over them all but an artless and genuine belief in the triumph of goodness sooner or later which is refreshing in an age of scepticism,ovel

never knowing that they had succeeded to praise a child for any precocious faculty or personal grace is a sure way to deprive it of its charm and men are but children of a larger growth when all has been said that can be said about nipping genius in the bud the fact remains that literature has lost at least as much by cordial recognition as by stupid indifference with all his enormous resources

not that the faculty decays but that its movements are no longer free and unembarrassed the youthful aspirant in literature has more to fear from his friends than from his enemies his prayer should be

from any fear of stopping the supply he has had no inconsiderable share of praise but he has passed through the ordeal unscathed  mine is thine so far from being a falling off from his previous works is an advance upon them profiting by experience and exercise colonel lockhart has knit the parts of his story more firmly together and the qualities which made fair to see so enjoyablethe fresh exuberant humour the firm grasp of character the unaffected sympathy with romantic passion the exhilarating description of life in the open air show no signs of having lost their edge his hand has gained in cunning and none of his natural force is abated at the beginning of the third volume one almost wishes that colonel lockhart had been content to wind up the story in two volumes he begins there to raise a suspicion that the remainder of the novel is to be a political treatise consisting mainly of an exposition of the principles of moderate conservatism in which his hero found a career even if we had not had little sympathy with the creed expounded we imagine we should have looked upon this plunge into politics in a novel of which the main interest is not political as an unprofitable deviation but the dull interval does not last long after some chapters of commonplace when the reader feels inclined to throw down the book as containing no incident that he could not guess without reafding it and no reflection that he has not heard before a new subject of interest is suddenly started and curiosity is kept on the alert and the sense of hunmour agreeably titillated

critics an essay they sav is the right form in which to embody these high purposes an author ought not to foist his speculations upon the public in a manner necessarily so untruthful and incomplete then tragical subjects are said to be unfit for novels io choose a tragical subject is instantly pronounced to be a mark of illtaste an intricate plot is decried as impossible in real life carefully elaborated characters are held up as burlesques of human nature altogether it will be found that unfavourable criticisms generally point to the fact that the novelwriter has aimed at too much his plot or his characters or his speculations are overdone to say that the novel shall represent without overstepping the modesty of nature real human life is no longer a sufficient definition we are beginning to restrict it within very much narrower bounds some weeks ago we read in a critical journal a definition of what the novel should be which perhaps most of our modern school of critics would accept the writer stated that the only proper subjectmatter for the novel was the manners of the time in which it was written with great ingenuity he proceeded to show bow invaluable such books would be to historians of later ages who would thus have documents ready to their hands from which to cull those historical flowvers which so pleasantly bestrew their heavier pages  tom jones was cited as an example of this orthodox novel tom jones from which book we learn that swearing was more common in those days than in these and that the lighter vices were not so strictly kept behind the veil as they now arc if we accept this definition of the novel viz that it shall represent solely the manxerg of the time in which it is written then  framley parsonage is a model novel this with the other numerous works of mr trollope will be hailed by after ages as a priceless possession from its pages the future antiquary will learn among other curious fact that the contemporaries of mr trollope were accustomed under all circumstances whether of joy or grief to dress for dinner surely mr millais when he drew that personification of crinoline representing lucy nobarts in state of woe was in au humour of grim satire there could nqt be a better emblem of the book than this picture the pretty woeful face and claspd hands and jjtj pen4ant foot though this must be bloto4 id a godw breaker fashion squeezed into odd corners to give due prominence to that mountain of flounces are as the touches of real human nature which mr trollope has sparsely scattered on the ourskirts of his huge mass of conventionalism the story turns upon the inconveniences caused by a billacceptance and the disquiets arising from a loveaffair between a rich lord and the sister of his parsonfriend the bill with all its attendant expenses does not exceed a thousand pounds mark robarts who accepts it has an income of fifteen hundred ayear moreover all his friends are rich and are eager to lend him or to give him the thousand pounds in question one does not quite see why the affair should end in bailiffs taking possession of the parsonage furniture save that the exigencies of the story demand that little piece of excitement and that a moral is thus pointed how very much more shocking it is for a clergyman to suffer such misfortune than a layman with regard to the lovepassage between lucy robarts and lord lufton the only difficulty is that lady lufton his mother is supposed to be hostile to the match lucy will not accept ludovic until the consent of his mother is gained the mother never could or did refuse ludovic anything and so when he asks her to consent to the marriage she does consent why lucy should so often enter upon the scene woebegone in crinoline does not sufficiently appear there are the usual questions of conscience in the bookthe struggaes between duty and pleasure which lie at the bottom of all human stories here these take the form of casuistries as to what a parson ought to do or ought not to do how far may he act against the wishes of his patroness ought he to visit a bachelorduke does the presence of his bishop with him in questionable society render that society innoxious to himself  mtay he ride to the meet with a friend and if so may he cross one field after the hounds and if one how many more by how much its the wickedness of having anything to do with a bill increased by the party being clerical instead of lay we know of old that mr trollope takes a great interest in the clergy he tells us some where in this story with a somewhat grandiloquent gravity that his mission towards them extends only to consideration of their social relations not of their parish or diocese business we are glad his mission is so far limited in another place he hints that he has a scheme for the equalising of ecclesiastical incomes which scheme would seem to us to be an interference with ecclesiastical business in its most sacred point however we are spaed the unfolding of his scheme in  framley parsonage and so we have only to look at mr trollopes mission according to his own proclamationa mission to satirise gently the  social relations of the clerg  spare the rod and spoil the child quoth solomon and mr trollope when after mild castigation lie relegates this child to a fools cap and the corner performs these severities ostensibly with an eye to the chiids good we have often wondered w hat lie purposes in these constant inild satires we get always now in his hooks a flourish of trumpets when he is going to trot out a pearson isle has acbievel fame for that trick and it is always printed in his bills in the largest letters mr trollope in his famous act of parsonship is received with loud applause at the threshold of the arena and probably hisses would follow if hle substitutel any other performance for that timehonoured one tlhe lady  e art of his audience especially aplreciate this poking of fun at their pastors bishop proudie turned into an old panrtaloon is meat and drink to titem the wickedness of making fun of a bi8shop gives an exquisite edge to their delight we could understand that applause of this per forinance would make mr rollope repeat it also that habit would make limn repeat itit nust be very easy to do what he has been doing for half a life but when we find limn gravely hinting a high moral purpose in these exhibitions andl referring to his labours past and to come as giving him a claim to the gratitude of his countrymen we recur with double force to our old wondermentwhat is his object  is he a special enemy or a special friend to the parsons  did a parson ever injure him or are all his relations in the church does he think the parsons the only men worth warning in this wvicked age or does he think them the only men foolish enough and defenceless enough to he lashed by satire  or is it that he has some natural sympathy or antipathy anent them  some men are strongly affected by a cat or the singing i the nose of a bagpipes any how the parsons would be well rid of him that the question of parsondom in its social as well as its other relations is a difficult one and becoming more and more difficult yearly is pretty generally acknowledged but poking gentle fun at the manners and customs of the clergyman will not hell towards a settlement of the question it has long ago been pointed out that the pet parson holds as it were an intermediate position between the sexes male and femalehe is a weaker man he is a stronger woman and it is against this emasculate condition which has been forced upon our priest hood graduallynow by rampant platitudinarianismn now by rampant attitudinarianismthat our muscularians have risen in revolt such discussions as mr rollope brings forwardhow far a clergyman is justified in putting himself in the way of contaminationwhether his virtue is pure enough to resist seduction and strong enough to repel ravishmentwhether the pharisaical attitude of gathering ones garmelits about one is not the most becoming and the safest attitude for himsuch discussions take for granted the semifeminity of the clergy and propose only to decide what precise cross between breeches and crinoline would be their most fitting garb another novelist is fond of touching upon this parson questiontouching upon it in its social light and in an humorous manner if mr trollope cannot get cured of his itch parsonwards he would do well to study george eliots treatment of the subject to return to the hypothesis of manners being the proper subject of the novel accepting this we must inquire what manners are in the sense of our definition manners are the conventional habits of society society lives in london for so many months of the year at countryteats for so many hunts in leicestershire during this season fish in norway during that shoots in scotland or travels on the continent during another society has its boxes and stalls at the opera its entrance into certain houses it consists of lords and commoners anl of some few out of the lower world who gain admittance into society by reason of their great wealth higher dignitaries of the church are in society and during the countryseat season parishparsons gain entrance on a lower footing sometimes an apothecary or a lawyer is heard of there lbut either is sure to have a ludicrous name and a burlesque manner ladiesmaids and foot men and grooms play the broadly comic parts speaking a language peculiar to themselves alone the countryseat has its attendant village and so we hear of robin postman and mrs podgerss baby the town has terrible dens upon its outskirts whither wild young men resort and so we are introduced to the tozer family society consists of a few thousand people who all agree to live much in the same way and to do the same things probably among these few thousands there is genuine tragedy and farce enough to form the basis of as heartmoving a human story as has ever been written animal hetties and mystical dinabs godfrey casses devotees of favourablechance and silas marners godstricken we have them all in those higher walks of life made by the same maker creepitig on the same earth different only in that their clothes are finer and their grammar more precise but then these deeper commotions of life never rise to the smooth surface of mlanner lovesick lucy wears innumerable flounces and the flounces are the chief business of our novelist we want description of the savages warpaint not speculations as to his thirst for blood to say that there are no touches of nature in framley parsonage wvould be untrue but we do say that they are almost lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming floods of conventionality lucy is pleasantly drawn and sometimes her satiric utterances against herself express as well as can be her bitterness of heart thedevotion of mrs robarts in the bailiffscene is touching the spice of poetry that exists in sowerby gains instant acknowledgment in every heart as true the pride of crawley in its first conception is excellent but then fmr trollope has chosen to burlesque it with his flippant wit there are passages in this book so truthful so pathetic so humourous that they move those who are not admirers of the author to a tenfold impatience of the mass of twaddle in which they are buried the standard which the story sets up for itself is a false one there are no men and women in  framley parsonage  they are never viewed as men and women but only with regard to their relations to society the only conscience in the book is what will the world say the only morality  such conduct does not become such a position unfrock mark robarts anrd he does not exist deprive lord lufton of his title mliss dunstable of her wealth and they cease to be no doubt the accidents of life affect inen greatly but men do exist apart from these accidents we can take hetty strip her of her lowcly circumstances and raise her to the rank of a lady and she will remain the same hetty in maggie tulliver we have the very type of a nature always at war with the circumstances encompassing it but can we imagine lucy robarts lowercd to the station of hetty  does she not disappear entirely when we take from her her educated sharpness of tongue and her conventional notions of propriety  it is because mr frollopes characters are not men and women hut effects of given circumstances only that be errs so greatly in bringing them again and again upon the stage he has not the wonderful talent to show a beatrix esmond developed into a baroness bernstein  i   we have said enough about mr trollope to show that we differ from all the world in our estimate of his novels he is now perhaps the most popular of our modern novelists his name heaven save thc mark is coupled with the toast of english literature at literary dinners is novelwriting the highest branch of literature  and have we no dickens or thackeray to represent it if it is rumour promises us another novel from his hand in the pages of the cornhill his orley farm illustrated by an artist once our first is on every drawingroom table mnr trollope is at the height of his fame we prophesy that he will live to see his novels rated at their worth that we should return to an admniration of the fashionable novel long since buried beneath worthier fictions now resuscitated in all its flimsy flippancy is not a good sign ja i  rr tile literary examiner 7 itklei i unonage by anthony trollope author of  barchester towers c c with six illustrations by t e millais ra in three volumes smith elder and co the warden and barchester towers are the only novels of mr trollopes better than framley parsonage it has been said that every man if he could write it has one good novel in bin barchester tower is a sequel to the warden and framley parsonage is an appendix to them both it is in as far as they resemble the warden that the sequel and appendix claim preeminence because they contain the particular novel that seems to have been according to this notion in mr trollope or that which it was in his nature to write better than another man however superior he might be in genius could have written it his sketches of clerical life are his own when writing upon other topics he is always clever lively and observant but the limits to his power are more clearly manifest mr anthony trollope is not in the highest sense a man of genius in all his works best and worst perhaps there is not a touch of original fancy as far as it is possible for a no ve 1st to be without invention he is without it there is nc ingenuity in the construction of his stories the sketches of character on which they depend for their value are the result of shrewd observation cleverly expressed in everyday phrase never of any subtle or peculiar insight into character a remark that a square forehead expresses intelligence rather than thought or that most eyes are green may be said to represent the utmost stretch of mr trollopes subtlety these are such individual opinions and notes of observation as one may hear daily from a b c and d at any dinnertable without wondering at a b c or ds profundity but they are always lively and clever in expression always therefore acceptable again in the inability to represent strong passion mr trollope shows his want of the insight that belongs to genius the passion of lucy hobarts in framley parsonage when she pours out her secret misery of a baulked love to her sisterinlaw is an example of this she speaks of herself as having been  bowled over like a ninepin when she was so sure that she  should never be missish and spoony and sen ti  mental calls herself an unutterable ass and so forth all which is of course very manly and preserves the author from all risk of being himself considered to write spoony love passages but it does not represent the passion of a woman even when she as lucy is here doing hysterically mocks at her own grief there is no want of hearty feeling in the book a healthy human sense of what he has fairly seen and entered into with full understanding in the course of life is no mean part of the strength of this as of all mr trollopes novels the author is no doubt too much at the usual level of society in observation and expression to admit of pathos in his writings they do not even contain any flashes of the wit with which not a few men who do not write are able to enliven social intercourse but when he is at home with his subject and it represents a cause that has his sympathy mr trollopes clear expression of a wholesome human feeling makes its wsy home to the readers heart there is force then snd there is some force everywhere in the literalness on which he depends necessarily for his power as a novelist the literalneeb let it be leceembered of a thoroughly quickwitted and observant man mr tieheee is et his heat we hewe laid when writs of the clergy not of the bench of bishops for his bishop is a feeble caricature but of the leaser dignitaries of the cathedral close their wives and daughters and not of these only as framley parsonage shows the picture of mark roberts the young country rector too early possessed of a good living who is tempted into the fast set of country society beguiled by an embarrassed county member and led through weakness of character to risk the very existence of a home to which he is attached j with his whole heart is excellent the domestic sulo ofhis nature is well kept in view and even when ho  known in thc county as a hunting parson we ay mario to understand together with his weakness the dornotio qualities and the religious nature underlying p the sketch of the generous impulsive wife and a nr rc el ornate study of the not less generous friend and neighbour tidy j lufton patroness of the living whose son was marks j schoolfellow and is his friend are simply fault ss the j little weaknesses and the great strength of a relined womanly nature in lady lufton thc simple and iojd j hearted prejudices the pleasant airs nf patronage always a part of the true dignity with which she is inviterthe1 generous conquests of prejudice and temper and though gentle j sacrifices that come of the love ot a widow ibr her on iv son are combined in the character of lady linton with i deli  cacy of touch that is perhaps only the more admirably true j and effective for that literalness of manner upon which we have just dwelt lord luftonher handsome and good1 natured son who falls for a short time into the hands of i the philistines and mr sowerby the embarrassed county i member whose estates are mortgaged to whom little bills are a necessity of daily life and who with unprincipled goodnature never with malice ruins himself and swindles his friends represent also thoroughly well certain forms of life the weakest parts of the book are those which affect political satire the meeting at gatherum castle  all that relates to the immensity of tom towers to the jupiter and to mr harold smith who becomes lord petty bag or to the parliamentary struggle described as a contest between the gods and giants is feeble and confused the blending of false names of party leaders with the most resent dates the triviality of the particular alludion sometimes blended with a clumsy and exaggerated general satire represent the defective side of mr trollopes literalness it may please some readers to congratulate themselves on their own cleverness in identifying with lord brougham the lord boanerges who explains the philosophy of soap bubbles to mis dunstable at that assembly at gatherum castle about which the readers curiosity was raised only to bc disappointed utterly but mr trollope makes visible no reason that he could have had in art as a writer or in politics as a satirist for an introduction of lord brougham in that place neither is the passing sketch of him in any respect clever this criticism applies to everything that may have been meant for political satire in framley parsonage the chapter on the triumph of the giants is kindred in its affectation and clumsiness to some of the classical chapter headings and to the silly opening of the penultimate chapter entitled nemesis by introducing nemesis as  peen a that just but rhadamanthine goddess  whom we moderns ordinarily call punishment or nemesis  when we wish to speak of her goddessship straight j forward and sensible as he is owing much of his popularity i to the fact that he is the cleverest of novelists who with j out being more subtle than most of their neighbours speak j to the world in their own way out of a shrewd head and a sound heart mr trollope still has affectation  oe conquered there is one very noticeable but necessary osequence of this wandering beyond the true bounds of hi  skill by a writer who for his knowledge of character depends j on clever and genial observation rather than on what may be called the intuition of genius ft is that the distinctest men and women side by side with the most shadowy abstractions people the same book ieverything is real at framley there is an admixture of mei  ghosts at chaldicotes and they are all ghosts at gahrrunir castle while as for the town gods and giants they aro as like anything in life as mr trollopes articles suppose to have been written

B3005,"['6777697', '8854700', '3161913']",  phases of an inferior planet fiction by ellen glasgow heinemann 6s tnis is a new york story of bohemian art life the  chief fault is that the author has so passionately concentrated herself on the two leading characters that the minor  figures are carelessly imagined and drawn without force or originality but it will be read for its extraordinary  and pitiless analysis of a very woman of the time the effect achieved is one of unrelieved misery for ourselves we say franklyand it is a tribute in a way to the writers powerthat we regret having opened it so painful was the depression it left behind the life of everyone is in large measure a struggle against pessimism and melancholy and contains sorrow enough without calling in this ill omened prophet to destroy the last germ of hope for that is the conclusion of the whole matter mariana passes through ali the deep experiences of life and finds nothing but illusion she wins such a love as might be thought to redeem any existence from despair yet it leads but to deeper sorrows motherhood yields no consolation it seemed inexplicable to her that women went on travailing and giving birth that a woman who had once known the agony of maternity should consent to bear a second a third or a fourth child struck her as ridiculous she closed her eyes and laughed the experienced novelreader needs no telling that a story written in this temper ends in death but how that gloomy consummation is reached we leave the explorer to discover the hero is left in despairhe is a  father but an atheist he has uncorked a bottle of poison when a knock comes to the door he replaced the stopper still holding the phial in his hand for a moment the heavy silence hung oppressively and then he answered  what is it   his voice sounded lifeless like that of one awakening from heavy sleep or a trance you are there come quickly the men at the beasley rolling mills have gone on strike a

drawer withdrew the key from the lock and rose he opened the door and faced the messenger his words came thickly there is no time to lose he said lam ready with this message and the moral underlying it the book  abruptly ends it is not to be disputed that ellen glasgow has obtained a brilliant success if her aim was to impress the miserable doctrine that life is not worth living were such a mournful philosophy well founded its dissemination could only end in discouragement and decay but her insight is not equal to her powers of observation the best of her work is largely made up of externals and the reader cannot help feeling at the salient points in the career of her hero and heroine that there must have been in their lives much more than comes within her ken every thinker has moments of despair but none has attained real greatness who has cast the shadow of these over all life  we bid you to hope was the final message of the greatest writer of this century and one cannot help thinking that the latterday lady novelist would not be so gloomy and pessimistic if she would ponder the grounds on which that message was based at all events of all the  isms  in the categoryrealism and sensationalism includewe are inclined to think this  ism  of blank misery by far the most pernicious  phases of an inferior planet by ellen glasgow heinemann mariana the heroine of the story is elusive and absorbent and has many strange qualities of which endurance is not one for she parts with her husband mainly on the ground that her neighbours devour fried cabbage she has harmonious lines in spite of her irregular nose and her long chin so an artist made a poster of her upon their first acquaintance her profession was singing which she came to new york to prosecute in the curious society of the gotham house where mr paul the pessimist mr nevins the artist and others of her admirers dwell together she meets her literary lover algarcife once in love he finds many feelings revived which have been subdued so long that their expression is very difficult their married life is disastrously broken by poverty and the death of the child and mariana leaves her husband to despair which somehow ends in the agnostic becoming a ritualist priest the transition is accounted for by the necessity of working on philanthropic lines for works sake  but it is as little convincing as marianas neurotic incompetence or the late reconciliation there is merit in the story and some of the minor characters are deftly handled but it is about three times too long  phases of an inferior planet by ellen glasgow 6s ttrilnemann this is one of the exasperatingly clever exasperatingly incapable books which are produced so frequently today there is no grip of life in it and there is intellect in abundance the writer has a sense of style and she descends to bunkum she has shrewdness and she lets her characters take her in she has humour but it is of a truant fickle quality the story told baldly is rather sordid a luxuryloving girl who mistakes herself for a genius marries a very poor man of science privations make her miserable and him too for her sake so she leaves him and her art she is a singergives her opportunities for becoming very rich meanwhile her husband who is and continues to be a freethinker gives up science and becomes a highly successful ritualist priest do not ask us why it seems so natural to miss glasgow that she does not think it worth while to explain after many years the erring wife returns and says she has never loved but him with some decency he repulses her at first then succumbs to her fascinations and only her death saves his cutting his pastorship and running off with her to the sunny south the story is aimless nonsense but in the detail there is a surprising amount of ability the writer has a real power of sketching a character in a word or two as here for example wiss ramsey belonged to that numerous army of women who fulfil life as they fulfil an appointment at the dentistswith a desperate sense of duty and shaken nerves and there is an inimitable glimpse of the heroine in her frivolous moods she has

B1339,"['8488208', '8999187', '2854782']",  marmaduke herbert or the fatal error a novel founded on fact by the countess of blessington 3 vols bentley lady blessington has never written so well as in this novel of marmaduke herbert it is altogether her best book in thc construction as well as writing of it the interest is great and sustained by fair and honest means the narrative once begun its design is never lost sight of the attention never called away some will think that it is even too closely and exclusively pursued and the sentiment of it pushed to extremes but this is a question of art which will always arise we apprehend in connexion with thc school of romance to which the book must be said to belong marmaduke herbert is planned aud executed in the manner of godwin that is to say an elaborate investigation of feelings thoughts and motives with minute detection and analysis of the familiar workings of the heart is built upon a groundwork of romantic incident a certain degree of monotony is inseparable from a plan of this kind  but in the ready acuteness of remark the new and happy turns of reflection exhibited by the writer and the value of the lesson steadily enforced we have found thc look extremely interesting the design of it may be briefly described as an exhibition of the evil entanglements which attend concealment of the truth these are shown to be equal in bitterness to the evil consequences which i attend an act of crime in this respect and  in the autobiographical form of the narrative marmaduke herbert reminds us very much of a novel by lady georgiana fullerton which obtained considerable success a few years siuce but the treat ment differs in this respect that the meutal analysis is more closely carried out less distracted bv irrelevant scenes of passion and better accounted for by peculiarities of temperament and education there are minds in which the effort to be wretched with or without reason predominates over every other quality or feeling  and this in its origin development and growth is excellently portrayed hy lady blescinffton false interest is thus repelled and no claim for exaggerated sympathies on the heros behalf is

enough of his secret has become known t enable the wretch to make brutal harvest of these agonies of conscience we need not describe what follows further than to say that at last herbert finds safety

frequently have no control our happiness or misery depends on some trifling chance against which no prudence no forethought can guard us and the result of which colours our fate for the remainder of our lives that is the notion with which the feeble will justify their weakness always but the higher truth is sought to be impressed by the moral of th tale that mans conduct is his good or evil angel and that no one can move through the world unattended by the shadow of what he has said and done in it  oh  the vanity the folly which leads erring mortals to believe themselves the victims of destinya belief so subversive of the courage aud principle which enable us to rcut adversity no conduct is fate and had i paused tu retied on the trials of my life i should have found that all of then had originated in some fault of my own in the extracts we give from this skilful aai well written novel we must prefer what can mot easily be detached to thc more striking and ekiv rate scenes the manner of the narrative is extremely well exhibited in this carefully painted picture of a child acting as chief mourner at its fathers funeral  i followed as chief mourner to the grave it seeing

cloak that swept to my feet i fancied myself nearer to manhood i saw that i was au object of attention and sympathy and when my tears for a few minute ceased to flow i conjured up fresh ones by dwelling on all the proofs of affection my lost father had been wont to lavish on meso early do we prolong natural sorrow by appealing to the imagination and memory to nurse it and so learn to become actors in the pageant of grief while tears otl down my cheeks i was conscious that i was enacting my part in the ceremony with all due propriety that tjuse around felt it and that my sables produced a striking effect nevertheless when we entered the church and when the coffin was let down into the dark and dreary vault never more to he visited by the light of day and i heard thc earth fall on it i forgot everything but that i should never more see the pleasant face that never looked on me but with  mile of affection never again hear that sonorous but sweet voice and that in the dark cavern

in short isa powerfully written novel and may pair oil with its authors own  victims of society  reviews marmnaduhe herbert or the fatal legacy a novel founded on fact by the coun tess of blessington in 3 vols london bentley 1847 this novel displays a great amount of talent it is written in the most vigorous style and a powerful interest is at once c eated which is vell and ably sustained coie recommendation it possesses lies in the fact that it is distinguished from the general run of the novels of the present day by the absence of sentimentality it does not obtrude upon the reader descriptions of dinnerparties and ballrooms introduced in some instancts only to persuade the public that the writer has figured at them such books are very agreeable no doubt to young ladies reclining at their ease upon sofas and ready to be pleased and gratified with any fiction under the face of heaven but they are sickly food for the general reader to the young they seem new but the more experienced novelreader naturally seeks for something more original than a dinner flirtation a ballroom mishap or a toilette reflection the novel before us turns upon a fearful catastrophe the occurrence of which near the commencementof the work poisons as it was intended it should our enjoyment throughout and rouses a painful sensation which mingles strangely with whatever gratification we may receive we feel while the prospect of the greatest happiness is sketched out before us that a gloomy shadow lowers across the level plain that with the perfume of the sweetest flowers is mingled the damp unwholesome atmosphere of death that enter where we will into bower or hall the pale shadow of a murdered girl stands in the threshold pointing to her unwilling murderer and warding off perfect happiness from his path all through life the interest thus created painful as it is is still calculated to arouse intense feelings of curiosity there is a power of fascination in things of this kind our eyes involuntarily turn towards any object which pains us and therefore possesses the power of moving our souls  marmaduke herbert is therefore sure of success public curiosity once excited will be gratified the style of the narrative involuntarily reminds us of the story of caleb williams and this is because though the events are of a different character the incidents upon which the interests of the stories turn resemble each other it is not the actual crime or fault which can be said to be similar but the fact of the concealment of the fault the mere commission of the error in the present instance would not have led to the same results the con cealment of the first step instead of witdrawing the hero from his painful position naturally only flings him stilf more deeply into it one error leads to the commission of another and unhappy himself all through life he renders others equally so the domestic miseries which gradually overtake him from the days of his courtship of the sister of the poor girl of whose dath he had been the innocent cause and constitute a portion of his punishment for his unintentional crime are most ably drawn and do infinite credit to the countess of blessingtons powers of delineation the present novel is we think one of the best of her productions there are no lengthy digressions the story is told well and briefly so that we scarcely ever feel that a superfluous incident is introduced once in the early portion of the novel this occurs but it is a slight fault and we do not therefore insist more strongly upon it there are however one or two remarks which we feel ourselves called upon to make respecting the delineation of some of the characters we can allow a great deal of licence to the author who is engtiged in the task of bringing before us a woman educated in the camp brought up with officers and accustomed to their trodle of life we feel that she runs the chance of becoming mannish even coarse that some of the delicacy of her sex will be rubbed off but lady blessington has in airs scuddamore passed far beyond the mark her character is not well drawn because it is inconsistent she appears at first under very different auspices to what she does afterwards the woman in real life could not have lost sight of her feminine characteristics so wholly as she did or adopted the cool imperturbability only pardonable in a man which she manifests but even supposing this allowable it does not agree with her kind and gentle care of her niece on the first occasion when she is introduced to us nor has lady blessington at all accounted for her change of manner so abrupt and incomprehensible it seems as though the adventure had been intended to be prolonged but bad been accidentally cut short another objection we have to make is that our authoress frequently enters into details upon the subject of the dead body which would look far better in the columns of a newspaper than in the pages of a threevolume novel they are shocking to our taste our feelings are revolted and only at such itites do we turn with abhorrence from the pages there is an excess of brutality in the manner of the man too who brings tidings of the body which is exaggerated in the extreme besides it was unnecessary and as the messenger had no reference to the story it could only have been introduced for the sake of producing a startling effect it is intended to harrow up our feelings the more by witnessing how our heros conscience reproaches and upbraids itself during the scene in which he is compelled to behold the sufferings of his wife and mother while listening to the mans dreadful details but by a little art a better effect might have been prtduced without the introduction of the messengers speeches besides the few faults we have hinted at there is nothing at which we can have any cause for murmuring the story is powerfully told and scattered through the work are many graphic scenes and many beautiful passages as a specimen of both we extract the following  at length 1 reached the opening of the cavern i entered it and laid down the lantern which cast its faint but lurid light on the grotesque rocks around a sickening dread stole over me at the thought of the change which six months must have ef fected in the ccurse i was about to touch and i drew back with instinctive disgust and horror at the task i had to fulfil nevertheless that task must be performed however loathsome however appalling the operation might be and i moved towards the opening of the inner cavern with the intention of drawing out the body when the loud hooting of the owl so startled me that i nearly fell to the earth ashamed of iny pusillanimity i once more approached the spot knelt down and though shuddering while i did so drew forth the corpse by the feet at that moment a huge bat dew against the lantern which i had placed on a projecting rock upset it and extinguished the light for some time i felt unable to move and almost incapable of thinking my hand still clasping the icy feet at length i recovered myself sufficiently to grope in the direction in which the lantern had fallen and after a considerable time spent in searching for it i found it and struck a light with a tinder box which i had fortunately put into my pocket in fear of accident i dared not look on the face of the dead the shawl 1 had wrapped around it still enveloped it and most thankful was i that 1 was spared the horror of beholding its altered state i commenced digging a grave large drops of perspiration dropping from my forehead while vith the pickaxe i endeavoured to loosen the compact earth to enable the spade to penetrate it while i thus laboured huge bats were continually flitting around me and from time to time the screech owls sent forth their lugubrious cries i dug deep into the earth and though ready to drop with fatigue from the hard and unusual labour i desisted not until i had penetrated some five feet beneath the surface i then averting my head while i did so raised the body in my arms its extreme lightness astonished me but the cause was revealed when the shawl accidentally falling aside exposed one of the arms and hands of the deceased owing i suppose to some peculiar quality in the earth or air in which the corpse had rested it had become dried up like those of a mummy though shocked at beholding the withered discolorred limbs it was less dreadful than to see it in an advanced state of decomposition as i expected and emitting that fearful odour which marks the decay of mortality nothing of this  assailed my olfactory nerves and i was grateful to providence for being spared it i placed the matting as a lining in the grave and then descending with my lifeless burden using as much tenderness towards it as if it were still susceptible of feeling i placed it gently in its last earthly restingplace and read the burialservice over it the sound of my own voice as i pronounced the words of that sacred and touching service powerfully affected me no human accent gave the response but the birds of night shrieked dismally while i prayed i then covered the corpse with a piece of matting and commenced filling up the grave with the earth i had previously dug shrinking during the operation at the thought that the cloak and matting alone intervened between the corpse and the clay i was shovelling over it i would have given heaps of gold had i possessed them to have had a coffin in which to place the cold remains but this was not possible and although i shuddered at every spadefull of earth i threw into the grave i nevertheless continued my painful labour until the floor of the cavern resumed its former appearance i then strewed dust over the spot and arming myself with the pickaxes spade and lantern bade a sorrowful farewell to it never shall i forget that night l an unusual stillness prevailedunbroken save by the occasional bark of some cottagers dog or the cry of some bird of night scarcely a breeze moved the leaves of the high trees whose long shadows fell like giants across the road in some parts so close as to exclude the light i hurried on through this solitude my own footsteps sounding so loud us to startle me and the beating of my own heart making itself audible sometimes a low sighing or murmuring of the heavy branches of the trees moved by an occasional gust of wind dashing down through some deep ravine from the mountains striking my ear with so sad a sound that my superstitious forebodings connected it with a supernatural warning of the danger of my mother and i would hurry more rapidly than before until breathless and exhausted i was coum pelled to rest for a few minutes those fitful gusts of the night wind followed again by a long stillness had something so inexpressibly solemn and imposing in them that they made me shudder and when some mountain torrent rutnhed down the precipitous path it had formed for itself leaping wildly from crag to crag and dashing its white foam around i felt as if it were some mysterious agent endowed with power from which i wished to escape and again i hurried on until out of hearing of its deafening noise then blaming my unmanly weakness i would turn back for a moment by the dark and funeral mountain pines and the next instant breaking into light its white masses like huge heaps of snow falling from some alpine height into the valley beneath with the sound of a mighty flood and angry with in self for even the momentary delay i would resume my rapid pace while the fresh mountain air failed to cool my fevered brow or burning lip at length the spire of the village church near my home became visible its little vane shining brightlyin the moonlight often in the days of my childhood had it guided my path home from the rambles i delighted in  and now weary and fainting i hailed it with an emotion that brought tears into my eyes i trembled violently as i approached the house i longed yet i dreaded to pass its threshold toe know my fate all my future happiness seemed to hang on the answer that awaited the question my tremulous lips refused to utter  have i still a mother a deathlike silence reigned around the garden gate was unlatched and i stealthily entered it and passing through parterres of flowers that looked snowy white beneath the beams and whose fragrance filled the air i approached the door lifted the latch hurried through the hall and into my mothers chamber there reclined on her bed the curtains drawn aside and four large waxen candles throwing their flickering light on her pallid face i beheld the dead one cry escaped my agonised breast and i fell to the ground as if bereft of life,ovel
B1947,['8691054'],  poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,ovel

propitious to the match miss livelyn gertrude has an only brother on whom is centred all her ailed ions almost even to the exclusion of other feelings the brother is thrown from his horse and in consequence of the fall becomes fatuous this stops the approaching marriage and on this accident hangs all the interest of the piece and gives the opportunity of the villain of the novel a count despoir to bring his machinations into plav even in his boyhood he has been thwarted in his plans of wickedness by the hero vandeleur after a long and anxious attendance upon her bereaved brother gertrudes health failing she is compelled by her father and her relations to repair to paris for change of air and scene the count meets her hears her story and impelled both by hate and love determines to make her his own the agent that he employs is  animal magnetism there are some well gouup scenes in this part of the story which work conviction upon the heroine in consequence she relies implicitly upon the count for the recovery of her brother in the meantime her betrothed vandeleur i by her banished for a certain number of months to ireland and it is understood that at the expiration of this expatriation whether her brother recover or not she is to make him happy by marriage the count under various very plausible pretences insists that all his operations for the recovery of her brother shall be kept a profound secret  thus he establishes with her a clandestine intercourse they both come to england and a very few days after their arrival the unhappy youth with many subterfuges of the heroine is wheeled out by her alone into the garden and thence into a deserted arbour where the counts meets her and the mummery begins the poor boy dies under it whilst thc desolate sister is moaning over the beloved body that she believes she has been instrumental in murdering for the wily count made her the magtietiser the father and the lover burst in the count shoots the lover and scares oil the father with his other pistol and the lady now amidst all this misery unconscious of her acts fiings herself into the anns of the rascal who expecting some denouement of this description bears her away to a carriageandfour the father believing with her consent all this is very powerfully told the lover being reduced lo the verge of the grave is unable to trace out the ravisher but he is firm in his belief of the innocence of gertrude she undergoes in the power of thc count unparalleled persecutions which are really harrowing to read and at length consents to marry him they go to america for some time and thence to moscow in the meantime her father dies and her lover wanders the earth in search of her for her cousin the next male heir wishing for the property accuses her of the murder of her brother and reclamations from the homeoffice in england are sent to all the foreign courts that she and her husband may be delivered to the english authorities for trial vandeleur has just so much the start of thc official messengers as to warn her of her danger he does it rather inexpertly and the count again shoots him but not with so terrible an effect as before gertrudes amidst all these horrors flies to the protection of the english ambassadress  and she being formerly attached to vandaleur gives it and gets her placed under the protection of the empress of all thc russias from this point the story ought to have been wound up rapidly but unfortunately three volumes were required ami so the emperor alexander falls in love with her and the empress grows jealous and all that sort of thing and then there is a long seclusion in the remotest parts of switzerland and a still longer departure from the rules of common sense in her treatment of her lover however after all the count is polite enough to die and a letter is found which proves that gertrude did not kill her brother and so at a very discreet age the two lovers marry and are made happy the greater part of the last volume is evidently a maketriical consequently it is heavy enough all the other parts of the work are delightful and as the working out of this story requires many minor actors we assure the reader that their characters are well and graphically drawn we have been already longer in our remarks on this story than we intended we conclude by saying that it is really an acquisition to our imaginative literature and that it deserves every success,ovel

B1093,['8586151'],  an open verdict an opm verdict by the author of  lady audleys secret london john maxwell and co miss braddon has written long and written much but her imngination shows no symptoms of exhaustion and her style gives no sign of staleness if any failure of power is to be discerned in this her latest work it is of a kind not wholly to be deplored for while  henry dunbar  and  only a clod wtith other books of what we may call miss braddons  storm and stress  period suggest a wide and accurate acquaintance with the  newgate calendar  an open verdict in spite of its professional title contains no graver crime than larceny and no actual breach of anv other article of the mosaic code than the fraudulent abstraction of a document involves perhaps many of miss braddons readers may regret this circumstance and look back with lingering fondness to the days when  undiscovered crimes and recollections of a detective were thrown entirely into the shade by the less chastened vigour of her invention for ourselves we must confess that we have some sympathy wtith this feeling such scenes as that in which the servant murderer and impersonator of mr dunbar is discovered by the waiter of the hotel vainly trying to open his despatchbox with the wrong key do not easily fade from the minds of those to whom fiction is as it ought to be a stern reality but considerations are quite outweighed by the satisfaction with which we regard a skilful and practised writer escaping from the groove of sensational incidents and the meshes of criminal intrigue to the fresher and more wholesome atmosphere of everyday life for when all is said it must be admitted that anyone can compile a more or less exciting series of lawless exploits though few could impart to the performance the same interest and fascination as miss braddon whereas it is a far more difficult and a far more profitable task to construct a readable story without transgressing the limits within which the stream of ordinary existence is restrained  an open verdict introduces us to the commonplace society of a yorkshire village in the immediate neighbourhood of a manufacturing town whereof though vicar is an indolent epicurean scholar reminding us strongly of a similar functionary in mrs oliphants tale  a rose in june mr dulcimer how ever gets on better with his wife and has generally more of the milk of human kindness in his composition than his prototype his conversational powers are by no means small and his rejoinder to mrs dulcimer when she reproaches him with a disproportionate estimation of  temporal blessings strikes ns as rather happy they are the only blessings we can fully realise while on this side of eternity my dear we may be excused if we sometimes set an undue value on them mrs dulcimer is a lady with a passion for making matches and is in many respects the leading character for she succeeds by the masterly indiscreetness of her manoeuvres in materially spoiling the happiness of at least five lives no part of miss braddons book is to our thinking more impressive or successful than the wide and fatal results which the amiable efforts of a goodnatured busybody produce on the people with whom she is brought into contact next to the vicar the most noticeable person in little yafford is a melodramatic person called christian harefield who lives in strict retirement with his only daughter brooding over the memory of his wife whom he brutally illtreated as long as she was within his reach this gentleman is represented as a type of the haughty aristocrat but of his manners two specimens shall suffice he appends to a letter on business addressed to his solicitor the following possjript oblige me by sending the quietest of your girls to play with my daughter every afternoon at three and to the same gentleman he also writes  dear scratchellmy daughter is ill and wants pleasant company please let your girl come and stay with her if there is any loss involved in your daughter being away from home i shall be happy to send you a choque for whatever amount you may consider sufficient yours truly c ii the said daughter isabella scratchell will be familiar to all miss braddons readers innocent in appearance mild in manner she conceals a ferocious disposition behind a beaming exterior and so forth in point of fact she is as detestable a little minx as one would wtish to meet and does great credit to her creators unimpaired powers she is the conscious as mrs dulcimer is the unconscious maker of mischief in the book and without saying anything of her ultimate fate we feel that she is rightly served in being compelled by parental and pecuniary pressure to marry a coarse old widower who introduces his courtship by remarking that   mrs pipers death left a vide here mr piper touched his waistcoat to indicate that the vacuum was in his heart mr piper also called his sons by the names cobbett bentham horn tooke and brougham while his daughters were christened elizabeth fry and mary wolstencroft mr piper was another inhabitant of little yafford as was also the rev cyril culverhouse a fervid high churchman andor should we say but   the lover of beatrix harefield mr culverhouse was not in our opinion a nice young man it is true that he wtas an earnest i priest and that he was successful in converting the  shallowest specimen of the  shallow infidel  ever presented to the gaze of the orthodox but when the gloomy christian harefield whose gloom was perhaps increased by a habit of reading the westminster lleview died with every symptom of poisoning by opium the virtuous cyril immediately suspected beatrix of being a murderess on thc cogent and convincing evidence that she had been taking laudanum as a cure for sleeplessness whereupon having already proposed and been accepted he deserts her of course the holy man  loved her none the less because he kept aloof from her of course the fact that she had once asked in a fit of illtemper whether it was wicked to wish for her fathers death implied to the clerical mind that  she had already committed the sin nevertheless we think many people will agree with mr culverhouses cousin in thinking that he behaved like a  mean hound the said cousin sir kenrick culverhouse not unnaturally takes advantage of cyrils cowardice for beatrix has ten thousand ayear and sir kenricks estate is encumbered for a british officer he was by no means deficient in natural eloquence  let the beginning of a brighter and happier life date from today you are one of those flowers of earth which seem to be born to blush unseen you who aro so worthy of love and admiration have lived hidden from those who could admire and appreciate but if a real and unmeasured love in the present can compensate for your losses in the past that love is yours beatrix but we are sorry to say that in spite of these fine sentiments sir kenrick commits the unpardonable sin j of revealing a ladys secret and adds if possible to his guilt by making the revelation to another lady and that lady mrs dulcimer we are afraid that there is more than one u mean hound  in miss braddons story we think we have sufficiently indicated the lines of miss braddons narrative which is exceedingly well written and keeps up its interest from the first page to the last we have indeed omitted to mention that there is an affair of the heart to which ono of the parties is a married woman for that goes without saying in the case of miss braddon as does its invariably innocent termination so practised a writer should have avoided such a solecism as  standing at gaze and political controversy cannot excuse such an odious vulgarism as  vulgarian miss braddons book like those of emmanuel joyce her converted cobbler contains a richness of illustration that las a charm even for the unlearned an urn cannot be brought in for breakfast without being  dimly suggestive of sisterly affection in the person of electra  wisdom as mature as bacons or pascals  sounds well but unfortunately pascal never reached maturity nor do we think it true that mr carlyle is a writer demanding a considerable expenditure of brain power on the part of his readers these are paltry blemishes but in so excellent a novel it is necessary to criticise minutely if we criticise at all on one point of more importance we should like to say a fiual word to miss braddon she is one of the few writers whose position is sufficiently secured to enable her to deviate with impuuity from established customs and she must be aware without our telling her that  an open verdict might just as easily have been written in two volumes as in three signs of deliberate padding are by no means wanting and though it is wrell done it had better not have been done at all life is short and art is longvery long the threevolume system is a survival of the unfittest miss braddon will say they are persian attire but let

picture of sir george downham between the family of his first wife who despise him and his choice of a second wife whom he shall himself be entitled to despise is an excellent piege of satire and the

apprehend almost involuntary recurrence to the phraseology of scripture had this novel owned any other parentage its title might have led us to expect a narration of the notable murders done by a

not unimportant exception of their writing it is a distinct loss to art which we begin to fear will never be remedied a clear case for collaboration or at the least for the employment of a competent subeditor with an ear for the harmonies of our language in this story he has reached a very high point of interest for the men and women of today in the opening pages he expresses thoughts which have occurred to many of us at the deathbed of a parent the cold serenity of those who have finished with this life bears in upon us with poignancy the whole sum of experienceof love of sufferingthat is lost to us for ever the bitterness of our grief at the thought that the years of comradeship between fathers and sons mothers and daughters have left so little knowledge of their inner life the influence of a noble life well lived fruitful as it may be is difficult of definition and only the actual work done by anyone remains after them to testify to their spiritual life mayhap in the future a closer intimacy between the passing and the coming generations may be of help to the latter when face to face with the crises of manhood and womanhood and it may become possible to utilise the experience our elders won with so much agony of heart and mind and avoid the waste of sensation in this passing pilgrimage all we know of life religion may indeed help us to bear our troubles and give us courage but it lacks the definite signposts that the protecting care and experience of parents might provide what acute consciousness has any of us of the childhood of our parents and have we not taken it for granted that they were beings set apart from the daily toil and pleasure of the worldsuperior beings it may be but in spite of all their love and care a little aloof  stratton whose life has nearly been wrecked by a loye affair wishes his son to benefit by his experiences and therefore tells the story of his passionate friendship in the series of letters of which the book consists we wonder if the author realises exactly how searching and how true is his analysis of the heart and mind of an intelligent modern woman as portrayed in the person of lady mary christianone essentially fit to be a mans comrade and support in his battle with life eager to be an inspiration to him in his work but not a wife for an ordinary man with little sense of citizenship who seeks in her only the mother of his babes some impatience is aroused in the reader when mary instead of marrying strattonthere had been a boy and girl love episode between themdecides to marry justin a wealthy financier but the youth of the girl had been passed in easy circumstances and so without experience and thirsting for the power to do things she chose what seemed to her the simplest waya way it must be added that all the combined influence of her family urged her to adopt stratton desperate at the frustration of his hopes goes out to the south african war five years later the two meet again and marys old interest in strattons future and the work he is to do in the world rekindles till without warning their friendship bursts into flame and all their good resolutions are scattered by the imperious demands of their love the man is prepared to go out into the wilderness with his mate but not so the woman and a peace is patched up with justin who has suddenly discovered the true state of affairs unfortunately justin has nothing to offer an intelligent woman except luxury an intensified material life and a beautiful home a cage for a woman like mary the very opposite of the spiritual development she craves we are not here concerned to pass judgement upon mary and stratton our business is to understand and see whether hasring accepted the authors situations he provides us with any solution stratton goes away and eventually marries a nice girl who has been in love with him for some time after several years he receives a letter the first of many from mary who in her desperate mental loneliness wishes to keep in touch with his work fate in the shape of a chance short meeting in switzerland deals them a final blow justin hears of it and will listen to no explanation in spite of the fact that their love had been purified of all that was selfish and earthly for long spaces we did not talk at all nor feel the need of talking and what seems strange to me now seeing that we had been impassioned lovers we never kissed we never kissed at all i do not ever remember that i thought of kissing her we had a shyness between us that kept us a little apart and i cannot remember that we ever touched one another except that for a time she took me and led me by the hand towards a little place of starry flowers that had drawn her eyes and which she wished me to see already for us two our bodies were dead and gone proceedings for divorce are instituted and to save strattons work to prevent the ruin of his home mary commits suicide their last pathetic interview when she has already decided unknown to him on her death is a masterpiece of sympathy in the final scene between stratton and justin mr wells conveys his message  stratton he said we twowe killed her we tore her to pieces between us    i made no answer to this outbreak we tore her to pieces he repeated its so damned silly one gets angrylike an animal i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you we never planned to meet and when we metif we had been brother and sisterindeed there was nothing i suppose he said i ought to be glad of that but now it doesnt seem to matter very much we killed her   what does that matter to me now  fiotion i the passionate friends by h g wells macmillan  co during the last few years mr wvells has been gradually coming to be counted among the few novelists of importance of our day now that we have abandoned the expectation of another wessex story from mr hardy a reader of literary taste can hope for satisfactory writing from only a restricted circle of these mr joseph conrad is among the first he is immensely influenced by dickens and markedly in style by henry james but he is what dickens never grew to be preeminently an artist in words and situations mr maurice hewlett and mr robert hichens are two more of the artists of today and the former preserves a touch of romance in his wider choice of subject and character which mr hichens has to seek and often not to find in the neurotic excitement of an unhealthy social circle of mr henry james himself we need not speak both as belonging to an older generation and as having evolved a style of his own which is now as far beyond criticism as carlyles or merediths into this circle mr wells has forced his way by sheer weight of subjectmatter in a series of remarkable novels tonobungay  anne veronica the new machiavelli  marriage and  the passionate friends he has dealt with various aspects of a problem which threatens modem society with dissolution unless some answer can be propounded to itthe condition of woman mr wells has had no cause to repeat the complaint familiar a quarter of a century ago that english writers of fiction find it impossible to deal with fully one half of the subject of their art to use oldfashioned language four of his heroes out of the five are adulterers while his description in one or two of the novels of the minor manifestations of sexual attraction though well observed would seem even to the majority of french writers of fiction unpleasantly realistic but the transparent sincerity of mr wells and the weight of his thought carry him triumphantly past censure on these accounts his serious fault howeverone which will weigh more and more against him as years go onis that he has never cared to learn how to write in his recent novels there are deformities which an adequate revision would have eliminated strings of adjectives smother their noun   massive ancient and traditional common way of living  vast enduring normal human existence illiterate agricultural unprogressive and simple unlettered laborious and essentially unchanging are examples from a single page of this novelmuch as in the modern drawing four or five approximate strokes of the pencil replace the firm line of the great masters we do not insist in english on that inexorable rule of french prose which admits only of a single adjective to each nounthe double adjective is often not only useful but also beautiful but such phrases as those cited above seem to us examples of mental sloth the absence of rhythm and balance in mr wellss sentences is a still greater fault the first test of good prose is that it should be capable of being read aloud and such a phrase as  and also to all those other  could not have been passed over by any writer with a fine ear the number of mixed metaphors in the book too is eloquent of nonrevision mr wells the social rebel and reformer mr wells the storyteller are with us in their prime but mr wells the artist has not developed to some perhaps to him with the weight of his message upon him this may seem a small thing dont it state the facts and dont it rhyme in places  was the remonstrance made by a disappointed author to a western editor who had rejected his poem on literary grounds but mr wells when lie is describing the aspects of modern life which move him is not only writing for today he isto use the thought of his own striking introduction to this book  writing also for posterity our descendants will come when they are seeking a knowledge of our times not to the  anna matildas  of today but to the great books written with serious purpose and it behoves mr wells when lie anatomizes the confused society in which we live to give of the best that is in him with this exception there seems no reason why we may not expect from him in the near future very great fiction he has produced short stories of admirable quality his scientific romances exhibit a fertile imagination well under control and his more serious novels show close observation of the tragedy which the inner life of any intellectual personman or womanmust present in the story before us this inner tragedy is the prelude to an outer one the last sacrifice of passionate friendship to love the story is written down by a father for his son when lie grows up a common form to which mr wells adds a personal touch by his recognition of the appalling uselessness of our personal experience to any one but ourselves it is the history of the love of stephen stratton for lady mary christian of her love for him of their separation and meeting again and once again and of her suicide under an unfounded charge to save his work in the world we have no hesitation in saying that the character of mary is the finest and most complex that mr wells has ever created she is a free woman loving and loved but resolved to remain free to this end she marries a wealthy manjustinto whom she is to be merely a part of his collection of precious things resolved as she is to be neither a young mans slave nor an old mans darling five years later stephen and she meet again and their buried love bursts into flame it is of course discovered but peace is patched up upon terms lady mary becomes the mother of justins children and stratton marries in the middle of his campaign of social politics again after an interval of years mary feeling the need of her old friends confidence begins a correspondence and her letters as presented by mr wells are perhaps the most subtle bits of psychology he has ever achieve d theyreveal in a convincing light the inner attitude of the  pretty silken furry feathery jewelled 8ilence8 who are the women of today they hint at the vengeance which is falling upon society for taking away from serious women their proper share in the duties of the greater world and exaggerating the disabilities of sex like harold frederick in a wellknown novel written many years ago mr wells insists that a system founded on the subjection of women is doomed to perish and that until some way of rational freedom is opened out to them society cannot be stable by chance the friends meet again for a few hours the passionate jealousy of justin bursts out and mary dies by her own hand after a last pathetically futile meeting with stratton apart from the fundamental problem of the book the present trend of mr wellss mind is indicated by the career of his hero the glorification of machinery as against that typical creation of the last century the unskilled labourerone of its byproducts the cult of constructiveness and synthesis the insistence on the importance of india and china as factors of the civilization of the coming years his changing way of looking at labour problems all this is suggestive of thought no matter what the readers economical or political standpoint may be agree or disagree as we may we recognise the intensity of the authors interest in what lie has to say and as we lay down the book our thoughts turn once more to the sweet and noble figure of his heroine unconscious martyr to a cause which has yet to come to the front of life before complete civilization is reachedthe making possible of friendship between man and woman lamiti6 impossible  n i  the passionate friends by h g wells macmillan 6s once more in the autobiographic manner introduced in tonobungay mr wells gives us in the passionate friends a novel which is partly sociological essay partly a notebook of selfrevelation partly a philosophical homily wrapped up in fiction and in that stirring language more chastened perhaps than usual that invariably invests this authors work with such astonishing vitality and interest mr wells has to all appearances broken free from the academic socialism of his early life and now apparently feels himself alone in the world strong enough and confident enough to break down or construct at his own sweet will and pleasure he writes now as a mature sage looking out upon life from the pulpit of his own library in this novel he once more deals with the problem of marriage and though what he says and the manner of saying it is invariably interesting full of ideas and strong it can hardly be said that mr wells has added much to the question or indeed struck any vibrating note of truth such as one finds say in the pages of an autobiographic writer like strindberg always one feels that mr wells is not saying what he would really like to say of course the conditions of our literary market are preposterous and a writer is more or less the slave of them one lives in hope and somehow one feels that mr wells is all the time toying with his subject and never really taking out his literary knife to flense the weaknesses sores and evils that he evidently descries in our social life one has the feeling that mr wells is too often consciously subscribing to convention and not really facing the music as a stern thinker and sociologist however this is a novel and not science a work to entertain us rather than to instruct everything that mr wells writes is interesting indeed he is perhaps the most allround arresting novelist that we have in this country in the passionate friends one finds very illuminating very delightful very eager very tender passages he is especially good on boyhood and the first pages of this book are wholly delightful as composition even if the incurable literary grumbler finds reason to cavil at the novelistic optimism which characterises every page with its inevitable avoidance of things that are not cheerful or what mr shaw would call pleasant there is a little too much of the daily telegraph tone about this book none the less it is a real book if it does not approach the greatness of the new machiavelli it is certainly a book to be read and considered,ovel

in scotland and the date appears to be either the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth decade of the present century at that time a number of the more peculiar and character istic social customs and observances of the scottish people that have since passed or are fast passing into desuetude and oblivion were strictly kept and sllcetrely respected the author of this work has evidently made a careful and thorough study of old yule llalloween the lovedarg the feet washing  and in the course of this novel he has accurately graphically and concisely described these curious ancient and now nearly obsolete rites and practices the pictures of scottish country life that mr gibbon has woven into his novel as a woof across the warp of the story have seldom been excelled and nowhere have the same subjects been treated with equal completeness  for lack of gold may come to be recognised as a standard authority on the festivals that marked the scottish year till about the middle of the nineteenth century its author has fixed in durable colours the lineaments of a state of society at the very moment when it was about to pass away and just before its features had begun to lose the mobility and energy of life he has been fortunate in the selection of his subject but he has also done full justice to it the domestic environment of the heroine of for lack of gold  is not unlike that of the girl whose love and sorrows are so plaintively and pathetically sung in the scottish ballad  hes low doon hes i the broom thats waitin oin me  and their characters bear the closest possible resemblance like the unnamed heroine of the ballad annie blair mill ocomries daughter has a  cankered carl  of a father  whall no twine wi his gear and a sister who discourages her suitor because she has not a  jo  of her own and cannot sympathise with ail affection that is not likely to turn out to be profitable but her mother is not alive to scold her and from all we learn would not have done so had she been alive she has however an abundance of trials to unlergo and through them all the burden of her heart is lat them cay or lat them do its a ane to me for hes low doon hes i the broom thats waitin on me but if the old ballad suggested the character and situation of the heroine of for lack of gold it was merely a suggestion for mr gibbons full and finished portrait is far grander and far more lifelike than the slight pencilsketch of the poem when the story opens angus lamb the son of a neighbouring farmer is betrothed to annie blair but the father of the former having lost his means through signing accommodation bills for the laird of balquherrie the father of the latter is determined to break off the match mtill ocomrie is a strongwilled wrongheaded old man and annie is too well indoctrinated into the idea that she owes unlimited obedience to her father to disregard altogether his wishes and commands the conflict between her natural and acquired feelings is one of the points of the book but it is in the case of mrs lamb anguss mother that the struggle between ihuman nature and scottish calvinism rages most fiercely novelreaders will probably compare mrs lamb with one of ar george 3iacdonalds most powerful creationsthe mother of robert falconer and may not in every instance give the preference to i the latter seeing that his daughters heart is set on i angus mill ocomrio looks about for an eligible suitor for her hand and fixes on the laird of balquherrie who is ready to second the millers wishes so far as lies in his power because the dowry promised with annie would relieve the estate from debt and free himself from i the torture he was subjected to by his creditors moreover it would enable him to repay to angus the money he had got from his father and that he argued should make the match acceptable to all parties concerned as a matter of fact however it is not acceptable for angus would rather lose his money than relinquish the hope of one day possessing annie but although the laird approaches the millers daughter with mercenary motives in his breast the affected courtship soon turns to earnest and he falls seriously and deeply in love the relations between angus and the laird now become dangerous annie under the mistaken idea that angus is willing to consent to and that be would be served by her marriage agrees to wed the laird but on the night before the union is to take place the rivals meet on a narrow bridge balquherrie has repented of the second injury he was about to inflict on angus and is returning from the house of the village bellman with whom he has deposited a letter to be i delivered to annie announcing bis resolution and stating that he intends to absent himself from the place for a time he wishes to explain to angus what he has done but angus will not hear him and is hurrying away from the spot lest he should be tempted to any act of violence thereupon the laird unfortunately tries to detami

engaged in america mr sala lost the thread of his narrative and when some hundred and twenty pages short of his goal ceased all remittances of manuscript it became necessary to bring the btory to an end and another hand was called in mr sala after returning to england preferring a close of his own very naturally promises his readers that if they will clear off the fiist edition as here given by the publishers of whom the ms appears to be the property he will write them a new last act we shall be very curious to see it under these circumstances the critic can only write in some sort conjecturally though five sixths of the tale are before him making allowance however for every drawback announced in this confession it would not be easy to name a more unpleasant story by a man whose fertility of invention and vivacity of style are indisputable  than this quite alone is unpleasant from the predominance of odious people to whom it introduces us blunt the heroine lilys father is one of those disgraceful men of pleasure who delight in flinging themselves down headlong ruining every one that touches or trusts themand whose death as it were on a dunghill excites more disgust than pity the diabolical french amazon who is blunts lawful wife their marriage not being the most explicable transaction in the career of one so licentious may be true to reality so far as her sensuality

fear to the genus black swan re pulsive however as are many of the people jost enumerated mr sala nevertheless contrives to make us know them all and when he has finished his story in his own way he will perhaps have brought us to tolerate them a little more for this end we must wait in the mean time we can say that these characters are not the secondhand rascals frail women and devotees whodressed out in tawdry and faded stageclothes by the nathanb of novelliterature figure by the dozen in the bad books of the hour but have a certain vitality of flesh and blood belonging to

excitement in  quite alone  quite alone is a franklyexpressed  advertisement mr sala explains how it came to pass that the present novel which originally appeared in weekly portions in a ll the year round and which bears his name as the author was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the

best to finish the task he had set himself but failed  page by page he says  like so many drops of blod about two hundred slips of manuscript oozed from me between spring and summer they were written with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and sudden death in the month of august i brose down altogether and the mails went out without any of my tissue paper i had lost the thread of my narrative i had forgotten the very names of my dramatis

to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed

is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year round mr sala invites us to do so in fact promising that if a second edition of the book should be called for he will himself finish it according to his original intention as the story at present stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end

bookwhich as a piece of literary handiwork does infinite credit to the gentleman who gallantly undertook it in the face of inevitable objectionwinds up the story in a manner thlat can hardly have been

season its defect which is mall arises from overimitation of mr wilkie collins the story is told in the narratives of three people like that of i the woman in whit and the solemn injunction of one diarist julian gower that tabitha tree for whom it is written shall not alter a word imitates too closely one of the weak points of the adopted model also for the sake of increasing interest olive blake while about her good work is made to perplex and grieve the excellent tabitha with mysteries that lead to less than nothing and that she can only explain by saying that it gave her pleasure to torment her friend seeing how nobly she bore torture and how faithful she was to her own heart in spite of every doubt thrust painfully upon it mystery so made is not legitimately made but in good truth mr jeaifreson is not dependent upon story for the success of his novel and if it were far more faulty in construction than we think it to be the book would be read with pleasure the most noticeable fact is that the inevitable defects of a tale told by triple autobiography are so far overcome that a man being the author of the book and two of the supposed autobiographers women they do absolutely write like women nice discrimination of character expressed naturallyit is easy enough to express artificiallythrough style would be too much to expect but mr jeaffreson sufficiently distinguishes between the two journalsone that of the active and brave olive blake vigorous in her i good work b7 labouring for years with fearless determination spending all her means to right a wronged woman though success proves her own marriage null the other that of tabitha tree whose womans life of disappointed love takes vengeance on the world only in smiling selfdenial and unobtrusive beneficence it is much that in the journals of these persons the sense of beauty in detail the minute notice of character the love of nature the merciful construction of evil and the faith iin god and in all goodness by which women make life beautiful has been preserved the book ts in direct con1 treat to that novel of mr salas of which we have lately spoken it is running over with the milk of human kindness which that writer accounts it clever to reject as lait ddnene used only by the sickly there is in tris stoyo olire blakes good work no trace of sickliness the faith in life is though expressed through the persons of women as manly as it is generous mr jeaffreson instead of proving that the men who please us are all knaves at heart pleasantly disappoints us here and there by showing us an honest kindly man where the experience of novel readers would lead them to see preparation for an act of villany solomon easys lawyer is an example of this and the good clergyman of the old school himself with  the corn  country  in which he lives the harvest felds he vists the lanes through which he drives ia his gig and his household with the two girls in whom the story cetre is a sketch more after the manner of the vicar of waked than of the woman in lihije we took up mr jeufreoms novel hardly expecting to be pleased for his book about doctors was unsatisfactory but the first chapters of olive blake at once proved that he has in him the right spirit of an artist and the wholo work convinces us that good as this novel is better will follow it unless the taste of the day

made a great advance upon his former novels good as they were the story told is an extremely interesting one a story that will certainly be read through and in some parts more than once by any one who begins it the plan does not reveal itself to the guesses of the sagacious reader until he conies face to face with the solution at the authors own appointed time the reader will also feel compelled to attend to his own duty towards the book  to read it steadily as he reads a living man whom he needs to understand not to advance his knowledge by skipping intermediate steps under the penalty of spoiling his own delight in the authors labours the author docs his duty not only by providing a very interesting story but by telling it remarkably well there is and always will be a fascination in stories of circumstantial evidence there is the hunting instiuct roused to track a fact through all the doublings and windings of concealment a reader loves to assist at the unravelling of a plot or the detection of evidence for himself and not to have it flashed out to him in halfa dozen sentences of explanation in the last chapter where the characters are grouping for the final tableau of happiness and poetical justice previous to the fall of the curtain mr jeatfreson has selected the method inaugurated by mr wilkie collins in his  woman in white the main actors in the drama narrate their own immediate share of the business aud speak ol nothing but what they individually know and feel by this means the reader is kept from seeing too far before him the first part of the story is laid in suffolk in the corn countya district mr jeatfreson knows well and describes with the affection of one who is proud of belonging to the shires the pictures of the old rectory and the kuy quiet fertile country which seems always basking in the sun are charming the rev solomon easy in his canonicals silk stockings and stately silverbuckled shoes examining the villageboys according to the dtclaraticnes of the statutes of the benefaction is a picture from the life the old rectors drives in the ponyphaeton through the lanes and fields to see the crops and his mild childlike complacency at being told he can drive a bargain are all so natural that the reader finds himself asking the childs question is it all true  it is not till the middle of the second volume that he begins to suspect that he is in for a tale with a plot in it the early life of the two sisters in tue quiet rectory the motherly elder sister and her young charge julian gower with his brotherly love all naturally prepare the reader for what comes that the elder sister loves him with the love of a woman and does not discern that to him she is only a great comfort instead of a great hope the painful awakening that her childsister and not herself has won the prize and the loyalty with which she contends against her own disappointment keeping from all reaction of injustice and bitterness are made very touching aud very true mr jeafvreson shows his knowledge of women by a manly aud delicate reverence for them for which women will thank him which shows a far deeper insight than the supercilious display of some writers and some moralists who profes to think that dissimulation and inbred fa lshood rre the badge of all their tribe one of the very best passages in his book is where he goes rather out of his way to pay his own homage to give his owu testimony to their deive to be true und to do the thing that is riht the way in which the older sister bears her disappointment is very skilfully managed th readers sympathy never borders on contempt although we do not think that mr jeaitreson need have protested so energetically aboat her crimson blushes there was no cause for shaine or any sense of humiliation  she was mistaken but she had been misled by circumstances likely to have misled any one and she took up the penalty so bravely that the reader respects her as if she hod won instead of lost in the second volume the mystery of the book begius etty the young sister betrothed to julian linds out that she does not care for him lie is absent pushing his fortune abroad to enable him to keep a wife the grandfather had died some time previously leaving them in thc position whicn obliged them to earn their own living etty disgusted at schoolkeeping discontented with thc prospect of her long engagement elopes leaving no clue behind her except that sho is gone away with a military man elderly ugly taciturn whom nobody had ever suspected of being aware of her existence beyond though most distantly polite recognition the elder sister in the shanie and sorrow of the discovery abruptly leaves the cottage where they had lived since their graudfathers death and goes no one knows where to hide herself from all who ever knew her from this part the mystery becomes highly complex olive blake who has only once appeared before becomes ono of the actors  she marries according to a family compact the friend of though mau with whom etty left her home an excellent man of mature age she tells her own part of the storyhow after she had been a few months married she has a strange visitor a young and beautiful lady who declares that she is married to her husband now arthur petersham was the most unlikely mau in the world to do anything of the sort the reader never for a moment suspects him the character is well managed the reader is made to understand his powers of influence though he only appears in narrative and never in his own person of course the wife does not believe ettys story the marriage she asserts as having taken place at a certain church is not on the register her story is wildly improbable in all its details when her husband comes back she tells him the incident his explanation is perfectly coherent and satisfactory etty never appears again and olive blake never troubles her head further about her this is treated as her sin and we think morbidly exaggerated by the author olive blake is the least natural of all the characters she is too much ofthe personage so frequently met with in old novels who has a mysterious knowledge of every ones affairs and who interferes in the crisis of everybodys destiny that olive blake should once startle a person whom she had never seen by her shrewd intuition may be accepted but when it occurs several times it becomes a trick of machinery rather than a trait of character after awhile in her sorrow for the loss of her own child she remembers etty and is morbidly haunted by the recollection of her misery aud her own hardheartedness in though midst of this it comes to her knowledge that her husband excellent sensible affectionate as he has seemed to her and to the world hitherto without a flaw on his surface has in one flagrant instance at least and very recently been a profligate under aggravated circumstances and the conviction is present with her that ettys story is true without waiting to mourn over herself or to think of her own position she separates from her husband and resolves to find etty and to do her justice as she had ample cause for her own separation it excites no surprise or question in society and with mystery and secrecy and unrelenting persistence she sets herself to the work of unravelling the iniquity of her husbands wrong towards etty the difficulties are enormous all clue has been so skilfully and carefully destroyed so many years have elapsed that discovery of evidence seems hopeless the reader is made to assist in the search and to pick up and add link to link of the chain meanwhile the fortunes of the elder sister go on she too has hid herself with care from all who ever knew her she has to be found not by the reader for the reader knows all she is doing but by her friends she has to discover as she believes her sisters child to hear from a strange lady who addresses her in the park a story which is half of it true and half of it intended to mislead her into the belief of her sisters death after a life of shame this portion of the novel we object to very much indeedit is a fraud on the purest and noblest feelings of her sisteraudthough entered into with the best of intentions is so cruel so unnecessary that every reader will resent it because olive blake chose to play at providence what right had she to outrage a good and patient and deeplysuffering woman by a story she knew to be false and for the sake of effecting a possible good in an improbable manner  the elder sister deserved better than to be mado a dupe through the whole story olive blake in spite of her good work is detestableher character is not enough worked out to make her strange acts a study of human nature sho remains throughout the machine her conduct to the elder sister after the elaborate plot for bringing her and julian together has succeeded aud we hope she is to be as happy as she deserves is atrociousno other word will suit to try her fine nature to the utmost to see if she can bo unselfish and generous and trust her husband under the extremity of false appearances she goads her with suggestions of diabolical malice and when she has administered her tortuie till her victim faints she allows her to discover that she has been merely trying her olive blake being the mainspring of the book ought to have been made more like a human being or at least to have been developed with more care so that the reader might have accepted her for the sake of increasing his stock of psychological knowledgebut as she stands she is a disagreeable improbability as to etty the victim too much stress is laid on the accident of a legal ceremony it does not in the least lessen her wickedness  it only renders her less unfortunate and gives a reason why arthur petersham should find it worth his while to secrete her in a lunatic asylum after he had abandoned her and married another woman with all faults found aud objections made the reader will not fail to read the story of  olive blakes good work from first to last for the sake of the story and he will return to its pages for the sake of though many noble and

B793,"['8673696', '8502457', '4384134']",  in silk attire new novels by william black 3 vols tinsley brothers allowing for the improbability which lies at the root of this novel and which leads to some minor faults of the same kind we say at once that in silk attire is thoroughly pleasant and readable marked by much and varied cleverness mr blacks plot is not in itself a new one the unavoidable rivalry between two girls who are in love with and are almost equally loved by the same man has often been treated but in the present instance the contrast is not so strongly felt as usual both girls are worthy both are unselfish each seems to wish the other to win it must have given mr black great pain to have to cut the knot if we cannot fully sympathise with him that is owing to the way in which the opening improbability is brought back again at the closeand has an air of bringing down the curtain perhaps mr black would urge in excuse that with an actress for his heroine stage effect is allowable he would add further that his heroines mother was an actress and that what is bred in the bone will never come out in the flesh the episode of annie brunels birth and infancy which serves as a prologue to the story has of course been put in for the bearing it has on this side of her character and makes the transformationscene at the end less abrupt but even this does not reconcile us to it wholly and with all mr blacks skill we never quite get over the beginning and the end of his story all we can say in their favour is that the author never loses sight of them they have their effect on the whole conduct of the plot if we forget them now and then and if we enjoy the book most when we do forget them mr black has not set us the example he is consistent throughout and is alike true to what is natural and what is unnatural the faults of the story swell the success of the artist when we dismiss from our minds this aspect of the novel we find that in other respects there is a want of absolute freshness and originality pleasant as the characters are and clearly as they are drawn they are only variations on the old types count schbnstein for instance the man who has made a fortune in business and bought a german title without being able to speak the language is merely new in his surroundings we think mr black ought to do better ought to be able to strike out something new in itself instead of contenting himself with placing things in a new light so too mr anerley the father of the hero is intended to be a likeness of the modern materialist and he is great in the scandal he causes to the clergyman of the parish in the difficult theories he inflicts on womankind in the goodnatured sarcasm which is infused into all his words as naturally as smoke is breathed from between the lips that sustain a pipe mr anerley is capitally drawn and we delight in his paradoxes  only we know him already we made his acquaintance in days when materialism had not yet laid its icy clutch upon him when he still went to church or was kept at home by a slight return of his old complaint when he did not suggest that it was a sign of imperfect development in a scotchman not being born with a macintosh here again we think mr black might have done better we have no such objection to make to his two heroines of the two we prefer dove anerley partly because she is more complete in herself partly because mr black so cruelly sacrifices her the change which is wrought in the character of annie brunel when she conies off the stage and mixes with other people is in some sense significant of her part in the novel we know more of her as an actress than as a woman yet mr black professes to show her to us as a woman and only to tell us what she did as an actress we must take her great artistic powers and success more or less upon trust and if they seem to us exaggerated we have no means of testing mr blacks account of them but the woman is brought nearer to us and we are called upon to judge her from our natural point of view here we confess dove anerley shows to greater advantage though mr black will hardly see it he may not take it as a compliment to be told that his minor characters do him yet more credit but we are far from intending this to be a censure the distinction that may be drawn between his fulllengths and his miniatures is that in the one we miss either novelty or power in the other we are able to do justice to cleverness and observation when mr black sketches the surface of life the daily occurrences when he pictures the retired teabroker acting as country gentleman in kent and still more when the counts foot is on the soil with which he bought his title nothing can be pleasanter the days shooting in the black forest is a perfect scene what with count schonsteins bad german and his general awkwardness what with the fine figure of the tall keeper and will anerleys accident our interest is fully excited and we share the regrets of all the party at the necessity ofa return to england but there are scenes in england which are worthy of being named by the side of this one and english characters by no means inferior to the counts faithful but unintelligible germans all that concerns mr anerley himself is as good as all that concerns count schonstein with the same abatement as to the principal characters and with one grave exception the ruin of the anerleys and mr anerleys last interview with the count are a blot on the novel and the more so that they are alien to the usual bent of mr blacks ability at least no other part of the story can be called poor whatever else may be said against it  in silk attire a novel by william black in three volumes tinley brothers a strange wild story of our own times very subtly told a young marquis marries an actress of great talent and high popularity she does not care to face his noble friends and relations he srinks from introducing her to them so they go abroad avoid english society and settle at thun wheu their only child is four yea old the husband suddenly tyres of his bnient and longs for london life pleads business takes leave of his wife affectionately and hurries away sending his man of business after the lapse of a few weeks to offer her whatever income she may desire she covers her broken heart with a mantle of pride and refuses to accept more money than will suffice to carry her to new york where she resolves to resume her profession for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  those whom god had joined  become utter strangers to each other but after a few years the marquis lying on his deathbed repents of the wrong he has done his wife and makes the only reparation now in his power by bequeathing to her and their daughter the whole of his property his executors who hardly knew of her existence have much difficulty in discovering her abode for her theatrical reputation is not now worldwide as it had been in her early days the old fire had gone out when trouble fell upon her when the lawyer waits upon her to announce her good fortune he is astounded by her renunciation of the proffered wealth he begs her to reconsider her decision urging the advantage to her daughter of being placed in the position of an english lady she replies that her daughter has been brought up in total ignorance of her birth and thinks it best that she should remain so she feels acutely how muuch happier her own life would have been had she never passed beyond the bounds of her profession and desires that her daughter should know nothing of the outer world however she will give her the lawyers address and tell her to apply to him should she ever find herself in distress this introduction to the main story for it is the daughter who is the real heroine is improbable in fact and questionable in taste it seems to us a mistake to have opened the book with it calculated as it is to produce an unfavourable impression on the readers mind it would have been better first to have excited an interest in the wonderful annie brunel and then to have gratified the readers curiosity by accounting in some measure for the strongly developed features of her remarkable character in telling the strange story of her birth and the sad tale of her mothers sufferings and wrongs let the reader open the book at the fourth chapter and he will find the orphan girl in london at the zenith of her fame as an actress her juliet is a complete success and we will venture to say as to our authors conception of the character that it is certain be cannot have seen the part so played we must unfortunately go back l to theatrical traditions for such an impersonation of shakespeares betwitching creation l suddenly there was an extraordinary commotion throughout i the house and a burst of that fine strong thunderous music which artists love to hearand then dove saw advance a girlishlooking creature with a calm somewhat pale and interesting face i and beautiful black hair she was only girlish in the slightness i of her figure there was an artistic completeness in her motions and a selfpossession in her bearing which gave her something of a queenly look she wore a magnificent white satin dress the train of which lay in splendid masses behind her and down over this white and gold fell a black lace veil partly hiding the rich i hair and enclosing the clear beautiful dark face dove was spellbound by that face it somehow suggested italy to her and blue skies and music and the passiona artistic warmth of the south nor was the illusion destroyed by the low chestvoice with which the girl replied to the questions of mother and from that moment dove thought no more of mliss brunel and wills friend 1 she saw only juliet and followed her sad story with an aching heart anl trembling lip during the matchless balconyscene will saw this intense sympathetic emotion growing upon the girl i believe it is con e sidered to be the proper thing for young ladies to be able to turn l round and smile compassionately to each other when the traic sadness on the stage is making the women in the pit sob bitterly and raising great lumps in the throats of the mei it is a pretty accomplishment in its way and may be indicative of other l iualities which these young persons arc accused of possessing doves emotional tendencies had never been educated however  and in this balconyscene as i say size watched the lovers with a painful interest which wrote its varying story every moment on her face the theatre was still as death the scarcelyuttered l tendernessesof juliet were heard ts distinctly as if they had been i breathed into ones ear and the yes of the audience frank in  the trembling lights and shadows ot her girlish passion with an unconscious delight and admiration elie abandonment of her affection the reluctant declaratioirs the coy shrinkings and piteous playful tender apologies were so blcnded as to niakc the n scene an artistic marvel and dove sat laughin maist like to greet as the old scotch song says tnii cd she scarcely knew t whether to laugh or cry with the delightthe absolute delight which this piece of true art gave her and wheti at last juliet had forced herself to the partingtis almost morning i would have thee gonc r and yet no farther than a wart nis bird t who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twist gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty  i when lingeringly and sadly she had withdrawn from the t balcony dove rose suddenly and with a halfchoked sob in her voice sad  oh will i should like so much to see herandxd  kies her she had nearly said but thinking it might be ridiculous she stopped  its against the rules dove said will with a smile  be sides that isnt miss brunel youve been looking at tat s b juliet both are very nice ladies bus they are quite unlike eah other a  a a  just as the curtain fell upon the scene in friar lawrences cell at the end of the second act mr melton conducted dove and will down a tortuous little stone stair into a narrow passage from which they entered into the wings a noisy and prolonged reca1 was thundering throughout the house and miss brunel was being led on to the stage by romeo to receive renewed plaudits when x she returned and passed under the glare of the jets in one of the 3 entrances will went forward to shake hands with her  i have to congratulate you again he said  thank you she said simply there had been a pleased smile of welcome in her eyes when r they met and yet it seemed to him that there was a strange intense expression in her look which was not natural to it once or twice before he had seen her in the same circumstances and invariably this unconscious mesmeric intensity was present in her i eyes he explained it to himself by supposing that the emotional idealism of her assumed character had not quite died out of her i yet then she turned and saw dove standing with mr melton will r begged to introduce his sister and the brief ceremony was sufficiently singular for a moment the dark lambent eyes of miss brunel were fixed upon the fair young girl with a sort of s hesitating lookan inquiring apprehensive look which will never forgot then all at once she frankly extended her band l dove a little frightened approached and shook hands with her  mr anerley has spoken to me about you said annie brunel i and dove was conscious that the darkhaired girl before her knew 3 her secret how singular it was to hear herself addressed in those low rich tones which a few minutes ago were addrcssing romeo in the r moonlight dove almost felt herself enchanted and could have ri believed at that moment that she herself belonged to the old sad e sweet play which seems to contain everything that was ever uttered about mans love and womans devotion e i must go down to my dressingroom now said miss brunel f to dove  will you come with me if you are curious to see r the place  i will send some one round with you to your box afterwards  will saw that dove would like to go so he settled the proposal by telling her not to be in miss brunels way and then he and 0 melton returned to the front of the house i while she is on the stage she ceases to be annie brunel  and becomes for the time the character she represents 3but this heavensent actress is mortal she loses her heart i and as the woman developes the actress dies out she begins to feel a loathing for her profession she has become lselfconscious she sees the people who are staring at her i she resolves to quit the stage and then there comes the ivery serious question how to live it is only as a last resource that she applies to the lawyers whose address her mother had confided to her the reader who has followed her thus far who has rejoiced with her in her professional triumphs who has pitied her misplaced love and felt for her in her distresses will be quite prepared to sympathise with her in her prosperity and admire the true nobility of her character equal even to the severe test of sudden unexpected and almost unimaginable wealth indeed the tale would have been more believable had the property been less enormous the rank of her father rather less exalted the ideal actress is admirably contrasted with the real actress a very pleasant kindhearted little lady a staunch friend in adversity though at times addicted to frivolity the lover is a welldrawn sketch of a thorough englishman very well meaning but rather weak in purpose who being engaged to a very tender sweet girl allows himself to fall desperately in love with the brilliant actress and has not the tact to keep his secret his efforts to bind up the broken heart are very commendable but the great truth that it is a mischief past repair is very forcibly and pathetically told the picture of his family circle is a truthful home scene of english country life and life in london amongst theatrical people is admirably sketched there ale pleasant views upon the rhine with its quaint old cities and majestic breadth of waters ruined towers and vineclad hills and some highly picturesque and characteristic scenes in the black forest where the vulgar millionaire of the tale who persecutes poor annie with his addresses has bought an estate which gives him the title of count his attentions to miss brunel are very far from being so disinterested as he strives to make them appear when he urges his suit with the promise that s she shall walk in silk attire for he happens to know who she really is and has a clear intention of claiming her property if he can only cajole her into becoming his wife the pretensions and the soliloquies of this purseproud retired teabroker are very absurd yet we cannot call the character overdrawn the many touches of his apparent generosity in which a reference to the promotion of one or other of his pet schemes may always be detected are very skilfully thrown in and his notion that all the world is bound to do his bidding and help forward his plans is a clever exemplification of the views of many a prosperous mana persuasicf which has probably aided him in achieving his prosperity we wish the book the success it deserves it possesses much originality it is agreeably written the characters are thoroughly lifelike and carefully thought outcertainly the heroine is almost too good to be true we have spoken of her as an ideal for though such an artiste may not now exist it is an accepted fact that such have been and there certainly is no reason why so perfect an actress should not be as perfect a lady as noble as generous as sensitive as truehearted as lovable as teachable as pure we much prefer the creation of so glorious a being to the representation of a mere ordinary mortal those who are not of our way of thinking may find in dove anerley a young lady more suited to their taste  in silk attirm the three first chapters of this story which form a sort of prologue introduce us to annie napier a distinguished actress who while in the height of her fame is wooed and won and married by harry ormond marquis of knottingley who carries his wife to switzerland dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her or otherwise make her life miserable after living with his wife several years on the shore of a swiss lake during which time a child is born to them harry ormond takes a longing to revisit england which he does leaving behind him both wife and child whom he never again sees arriving in england he thinks it better or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better not to return to his wife any more but to live apart from her the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful marchioness of knottingley declining a separate maintenance which he offers her the marchioness retires to new york where under the name of brunel she once more goes upon the stage to which she also trains her daughter annie brunel whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother at the death of the marquis ten years after his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by  acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property of this however she refuses to avail herself choosing rather to live by her profession and she arranges with the english lawyers that even her daughter who knows nothing of her real rank shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality when she may learn her position and claims thus far the prologue the story then follows the fortunes of annie brunel the young american actress who has captivated the heart of london by the brilliancy of her genius we get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the playthe party consisting of mr melton the manager miss brunel with several other members of the company a number of critics aparvenu count the graf von slchonstein will anerley a friend of the count and others who figure in the tale this is among the first glimpses we get of annie brunelslight in figure and somewhat pale and dark there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features and a stateliness in her gestures which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey they were eyes under those long eyelashes capable of a great sadness and yet they were not sad there seemed to play around the beautiful intellectual face a bright superficial unoonsciou activity and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her for the rest she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists and there ended in a faint line of blue and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it the artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of for she wams an arist one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage  for once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter meltabandonment of her impersonations p on the stage she was no longer mistress of herself her eyes deepened until they were almost black her face was stirred with the white light of peasion and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore when the sudden intensity died down when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres she seemed to have come out of a trance not a trace remained of that ore and those intonations which were the result of uncomsious cration her eyes resumed their serene happy indifference her face its pleased childlike expression swif bive dexterous she was full of all sorts of genial marry activities that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dreamlife she led elsewhere this is annie brunel the actress and unknown to herself marchionese of knottingley holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance some of which soon force themselves into fact for it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever the story of her parentage is known to count von schonstein who has it from his brother a member of the firm which is the depository of the knottingleybrunel romance and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play having met mis brunel before in ia sin atty a novel b wilim bla author of i love or mariage thm vols losdom  tiniey i america he renews his acquaintance with her in england and with the knowledge of her parentage resolves to marry her if he can expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility one can feel of course that the count cannot be the man and as the result proves in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes he fails but the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness but because a better man is bound to succeed and that man as the prophetic instinct perceives can be nobody but will anerley yet one is puzzled at this for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation in the first place there seems no necessity for it then although as annie brunel and will become acquainted they grow to like each other liking is not exactly loving besides she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady a distant relation of his own dove anerley who has been brought up in his own family down at st marykirby in pleasant kent in spite however of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary though one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that somehow the destinies of will anerley and annie brunel are steadily converging towards each other and will finally become one in the mean time there remains the difficulty of dove anerley whose portrait is thus suggested it was one of those rare faoes which tantalise you in the eryact of admiring them there was nothing in it of that mature vigorous definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman but a tender uncertainty a halfsuggested and shrinking loveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features it was not that the girl samed unwell or in any degree fragile but simply that one in looking at her face could not help regretting that her loveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes this is the lady who has been the companion of will anerleys youth whom he loves and to whom he has been spiritually if not formally affianced long before he encounters annie brunel but that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change in physical and mental structure will who is the son of a country gentleman is a thorough englishman and is above treachery and deception he does not deceive and desert dove anerleybe does not even cease to love her but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound inspired by the young actress who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentleminded dove it all seems natural and inevitableand as inevitable too that annie brunel should fall in love with will anerley the two are thrown much together during a trip to count schdnsteins residence in the black forest in germany and on wills return to england dove notices the change in manner and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause yet as if foreboding what the end is to be she hardly resents the change in her lover a change also comes over annie brunel remembering the teaching of her mother she conceals her passion for will feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession and even when their mutual affection is confesed they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of dove anerley whom wim is bound in honour to marry the impossible game of suppression goes on for some time when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress the power of genius seems to die within her in the light of her strong passion the idea of a higher life dawns upon her she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her and leaves it almost penniless if not friendless at this time too the anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodgedan event which will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest worse than this to them is the fact that dove having somehow been smitten with cold is now dying of consumption suddenly in the midst of their wellborne distress fortune shines upon them from an unknown place this is the cause of itmiss brunel having at length been reduced to her last shilling and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer does so and there and then discovers that she is the daughter and ole heiressofthemarquisotknottingley although for a time quite stunned by the revelation annie brumnel soon masters the situation and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the anerleys but dove is dyingend from death there is no escape and she knows it but she sewe eager to get mrried to will before she d joa to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife for this purpose she gets will to buy a wedding ring and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words we two loving each other very dearly write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife and as a pledge of our constant love this however remains qnsigned and meanwhile dove getting gradually worse desires to see annie brunel whom will finds in her poor lodging attired in a simple black dress for her great secret is still undivulged i was going to me dove she said when i heard she had sent for me butis there an thing the matter     dove is ill he said abruptly  ii cannot tell you but she wants you to come andplay a

B5086,"['4855321', '9448677']",  tony butler tony butler blackwood the history of a dashing but impoverished young irish gentleman who fails in every practical attempt to earn his bread and at length is all but mortally awounded while fighting in a quarrel in which he scarcely pretends to take any real interest can hardly be an inspiring theme and yet out of this very unpromising material the author of  tony butler has managed to construct a novel exciting and spiriting in many passages and readable throughout story there is little or none the subordinate character upon whose portrait the greatest amount of pains appears to have been sp nt is an uninteresting personage the political intrigues the ordinary reader will care nothing about the ladies are either shadowy or heartless and nevertheless the vivid image of the hero inconsistent as he is with himself in more than one point carries the sympathies of the reader on to the end of the third volume the author has somee how the power of bringing a real man beforus we sympathise with tony when he is snubbed by a dandified hussar we tremble with him at the horrors of a civil service examination we are not disposed to blame him for threatening to kick a saucy foreign office porter we await breathlessly the result of the loss of the private dispatches bv the credulous simpleminded irishman and we heartily rejoice when his troubles come to an end and he inherits a large property and marries a sensible wife the novel in fact is properly the life and adventures of tony butler our eyes are fixed on him throughout and the interest which the book has which is not small is due almost exclusivelyto the curiositywhichwe feel to know how the hero will extricate himself from the scrapes into which he is plunged and here we may point out how much more important in a novel is the delineation of character than the multiplication or vivid colouring of incident though we would by no means depreciate the exercise of skill and ingenuity on the latter but the reason why tony butlers adventures excite our curiosity and interest is that the actor in them is brought vividly before us and the proceedings under even moderately trying circumstances of a character which we can realise as that of a living man arrests our imagination a thousand times more than those of a mere dumiy exposed to the most sensational perils the story of the novel before us is as we have said of the simplest kind a younggentleman of good family but small means residing on the northeast coast of ireland and petted for his good humour and skill in manly exercises by a rich neighbouring family is awakened to a sense of his dependent position bv a coarse insult determining to make his own way in the world he proceeds to london to ask somebody for a place and having by singular good fortune and no small portion of what is vulgarly termed  cheek succeeded in igetting a post as a queens messenger without examination satisfactorily demonstrates his fitness for his duties by allowing himself to be robbed of the first important dispatch with which he is entrusted thinking it wise after this auspicious debut to abandon the public service he finds a berth in a merchants countinghouse in italy but a sense of his utter inaptittude for figures induces him in spite of the entreaties of the merchant to resign that post also and to follow his natural inclination for a row by enlisting under garibaldi under the partisan chief her as might have been expected distinguishes himself and recovers from a desperate wound to find himself in the possession of large estates and in a position to marry a young lady who has long sighed after him such is in a few words the career of the hero but the subordinate characters are numerous and important and the underplot is complicated first of all there is mrs trafford a beautiful and rich young widow a daughter of the house in which tony is a favourite guest at the commencement of the story with her tony is apparently until just the end of the book desperately in love she is perfectly aware of his passion and giv es him all sorts of encouragement but never allows him to come to the point but she loses her interest in him when he grows rich and casts him utterly off seemingly in order that he may find out to his entire satisfaction that he never was in love with her at all and that his affection was really given to the daughter of a presbyterian parson an old playfellow who has always been pining after him and whom he ultimately marries with perfect contentment next there is mr norman maitland really a recruiting officer in ireland for the king of naples and the son of an opera singer of indifferent character but in appearance a swell of the first water an admirable crichton in all things and a man of a mysterious european reputation on this character the author has expended all his pains but hardly with the happiest results the man himself is heartless and the description of his affectai tions tedious while the details of his political intrigues fail to interest us much better is the sketch of his subordinate recruiting officer an irish soldier of fortune one major mcaskey the major is indeed in many respects the most amusing character in the book though the author rather apologises for him the portrait verges on caricature and the colours are boldly laid on but the redheaded unprincipled little condottiere stands out bravely from the canvas nothing can be better than his demeanour in the fashionable drawingroom to which he gains access by a mistake nothing more amusing than his plot to hoodwink and rob the unsuspecting queens messenger and nothings in better keening than his daredevil behaviour among the garibaldians or his plucky mustering and bullying of the runaway royal troops major mcaskey is a character which any writer of humorous fiction might be proud of having conceived and drawn a word of praise should also be given for the descriptions of scenery which never impertinently long bring the locale whether in ireland or italy vividly before us the sketches of countryhouse life too though overladen with unimportant personages are animated land well drawn we cannot conclude without adveiting to one very obvious inconsistency in the otherwise natural and carefully considered character of the hero isle is represented as not only all but uneducated but as incapable through natural dulness of acquiring any kind of booklearning and yet he is for years the chosen companion of highly accomplished girls a constamt guest at their fathers table he holds his own with cultivated people of high rank and when a mere boy seeking for a place is capable of writing a note couched in the most terse and epigrammatic terms we cannot but think that a mere athlete if as thickheaded as tony is represented to be would neither have been a fav ourite at lyle abbey or at the iforeign office but setting this blot aside we are sure that most readers will follow the fortunes of tony butler with interest will enjoy the humour of major mcaskey and will look forward with pleasure to future works from their historian i  tony butler 3 vols blackwood  sons tony butler is an unsuccessful attempt to combine the irish novel of mr lever with the later romance of sir edward bulwer lytton from first to labt the reader is reminded of  harry lorrequer and the caxtons of charles omalley and my novel but the imitations considered separately do not afford satisfaction and the combination of the two incongruous styles is an unartistic patchwork the writer uses a ready pen and bhows that he is not a novice in the literary craft but either tony butler is his first effort in prose fiction or previous attempts have left him uninformed as to the first rules of the novelists art in a certain sense thc book may be commended for cleverness  for each volume contains some flaslks of pleasantry scraps of effective description and happy indications of character serial publication is favourable to inferior novels beaders generally exercise a large charity towards stories published in parts attributing the dullness of a number to the system which destroys continuity of interest and commending the entire book for the brightness of an exceptional passage thus the inferior tale which here and there sparkles with merriment or startles with epigram and paradox frequently wins more praise as it runs through a magazine than an artistic story which makes no attempt to seize the good opinion of readers who are wont to dip into chance passages of the new serial tale just for the sake of tasting it and seeing what it is like whilst  tony butler was appearing in monthly instalments it was seen under favourable circumstances here and there it was sprightly  and persons pleased with a sprightly paragraph presumed it was not devoid of plot and character and resolved in consideration of its occasional vivacity to look at it when it should be published in a complete form to carry out their intention will cause them disappointment casual drolleries and fitful pleasantry are unable to carry an ordinary mortal through three long volumes of prose fiction the reader of a thousand closelyprinted pages of such literature requires all the aids and stimulants which are found in good novels he must have a story tending from the outset to a satisfactory end  he needs men and women so far resembling human nature that he can believe in their existence whilst the romantic illusion is in full force  he requires his fear to be roused by a possibility of disaster and his hope to be quickened by a probability of good fortune  if the narrative does not alternately rouse laughter and sadness he has ground for complaint and unless the book concludes with a  happy ending he will think twice before he gives the authors next book a fair trial with one exception  tony butler fails to satisfy these requirements it has a happy ending of a very hackneyed sort but the heros sudden acquisition of wealth and capture of a lovely bride are altogether ineffectual for the writers object since readers do not care a snap of the finger for either bride or bridegroom unless we are mistaken the author at the outset had no definite scheme for the middle and not even a single thought for the ending of his story indeed in a technical sense the novel i6 without a story it possesses a population of men and women who make speeches and do deeds but their acts and words have no relation to any grand chain of events or even to a master incident at the middle of the second volume he might without difficulty commence a rearrangement of the last volume and a half causing his characters to change parts and yet defeat no purpose of the earlier portion in character he is less deficient than plot but his chief personages are little more than hints for characters maitland the accomplished man of the world and political intriguer lacks originality but is suggestive  skeffington darner as a humorous burlesque is effective and with proper handling might be made much more so  and enough is seen of the lyle family to create an impression that with greater pains the author could draw female character one personage of the book almost deserves hearty praise and of him the author says  major miles mcaekey is not a foreground figure in this our story nor have we any reason to suppose that he possesses any attractions for our readers how blind some artists are to the play which they are themselves creating for the amusement of others not only is the noisy impudent military adventurer the most piquant and in spite of his vulgarities the most attractive character of the book but he is most unquestionably the foreground figure of the book he is constantly before the reader and altogether eclipses tony butler the hero who is as inconsistent and unsatisfactory a hero as we have met for many a day of gentle birth no fortune and sluggish intellect tony butler at the outset of the story is some twenty years of age and lives with his widowed mother in a wild irish county on a very narrow income his slender education was picked up at a village school and he has never left the immediate neighbourhood of his mothers cottage  he was not clever nor was he very teachable his apprehension was not quick and his memory was bad   dull men are not generally alive to their own dullness  but tony washe saw and felt it very bitterly this heavy youth with his rustic dress and manner takes his thick brain and honest heart to londonto seek his fortune after the fashion of his countrymen he has not been a week in london when he is  notable for keen speeches and philosophic thought moreover the politeness of his tone renders him a  favourite with guardsmen and young men of fashion  occasional reference is indeed made to his pro j vincial style stupidity and ignorance but from the day when he becomes a queens messenger till the death of his uncle who leaves him a magnificent estate tony talks and thinks in the style of a young man who after a course of eton or harrow

B1047,['6176712'],  the bride elect 3 vols newby this novel without any very great pretensions or lofty aim certainly merits perusal and that is more than can be predicated of the majority of the works of fiction that have appeared this autumn some indeed are so utterly flimsy that we have not deemed it worth while to honour them even with a passing comment the object of the authoress is to expose thc worthlessness and criminality of that most fri volous and despicable animal a male flirt there certainly can be but one opinion on such a subject consequently no amount of odium will be deemed too great to mark the infamy of such wretches fortunately however at the present day they are not found to exist in any considerable numbers mrs ashton the widow of a general had possessed great beauty which her three daugh tera inherited they resided in a pretty villa at kensington were well connected well introduced and enjoyed sufficient means to enable them to indulge in many of the amenities of life mrs ashtons income being however entailed on a nephew it was incumbent upon herin the phraseology of the worldto get her daughters married as speedily as practicable for her sake as well as their own three fair and accomplished damsels mixing much in society of course elicited considerable admiration and ashton villa was the constant resort of a number of danglersmen as we find them here designated of unmeaning attentions or pertaining to the detrimental race the only check upon these frivolous and injurious intimacies was found in a bachelor uncle a mr percy ashton who looking upon his sisterinlaw as a weak fool and his nieces as romantic simpletons was constantly taking them to task upon the subject the old gentleman estimating in its proper light the conduct of these idlers from having half a century previously occupied himself in a similar disreputable manner a beau of the old school mr percy ashton was a small man very erect and with a head so bald that his very large organs of selfesteem and combativeness stood out in alarming relief he was a very fair man naturally and the few hairs time had not thought it worth his while to steal were like his eyebrows and eyelashes snowy white  his eyes were of the lightest blue and of a keen phosphoric brightness  bis teeth beautifully white and even his hands soft fair and taper as the most delicate ladys and kept with a nicety almost feminine in its precision  for unless the halfmoon of each pink and filbert nail was clearly defined old percy ashton was in a perfect fidget in his dress he was as particular as in his person no speck of dust or mud was ever seen on his black dresscoat of superfine cloth his pantaloonsfor ho scorned trousers  or his glistening shoes his linen seemed as if it had been got up by the fairies so fine so white so clear and the plaits of his frilled shirt and small ruffles so even and minute he was very proud of a fine leg and a small and beautiful foot and with the singular whiteness of his face and hands his snowy linen and exquisite neatness and cleanliness his brilliant brooch and ring and his very courtly and aristocratic bearing no one could pass him unnoticed or fail to regret that so very few specimens remain of the london gentleman of the old school he was a constant visitor at the little villa and a great favourite with his pretty nieces

fall in their way so long as they amuse themselves and add to the boasted number of their victims old percy well aware of the danger his fair protegees are daily incurring cautions them and their mother as to their conduct at a ball and at the same time takes occasion to inveigh strongly against that ungraceful and odious mixture of a jig and a hug the polkaa dance now happily all but banished

pretty swiss peasant with braided black hair anda bunch of scarlet flowers in her bosom  her black hair was powdered too before the end of the polka and on his white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold the print of her scarlet flowers was taken as by transfer i leave you to judge what sort of a dance that must have been how the ladys and gentlemans heads must have come together and how close must have been the contact to leave on his breast the print of the flowers in hers oh its odious its degrading its indecent even and worse still its vulgar ugly inelegant a girl never looks so awkwarknever seems so littleas when shes being jogged along in the hideous innovation on all our national feelingsi will not say prejudices in england too its so badly done such a clumsy exaggeration such a caricature oh ive no patience with it it has been remarked that since the polka came into fashion matrimony has gone out spinsters are alarmingly on the increase and i dont wonder at it as the cleverest woman i know said to me at that same ballthe girls of the present day begin where we used to leave off i e with an embrace the severest thing that has been said yet well said isabel i quite agree with uncle percy and that is the reason i never will dance the polka the authoress is especially severe against this dance and on another occasion observes  i do believe that odious polka has put the finishing stroke to womans influence and mans reverence for the sex it has broken down the wild sweetbriery fence it is so much to beautys interest to keep unimpaired it throws her a cheap burthen into the arms of a succession of supercilious puppies and it is so very inelegant a dance that she loses caste not only with her partner but with all the men who look on to sneer but not to admire  well it is a vulgar ugly dance enough and ouch a bore i dont care how soon it goes out im no very devoted squire of dames and really i do not wish to carry a heavy girl in a sort of halfjig

brydges did not come she began to fear he had deceived her burning shame dyed her cheeks anger and despair lighted her eyes and fired her breast she was about to leave the spot when the sound of

who generously allows the newlymarried couple 2007 a month to be paid to her so long as they lived happily together but to be paid to her alone if a separation should at any time take place between them we shall leave our readers to discover for themselves the histories of isabel and blanche together with the fate of their two graceless lovers merely adding that the respectable banker unites himself and his fortune to the amiable daughter of a poor clergyman the poor girl having long secretly entertained a passion for him the novel is written in an amusing style though here and there we detect errors not unfrequent in works of the class to which this pertains the more prominent attributes of the male characters in order that they may appear more striking are overdrawn and the language they are now and then made to utter is such as could never in reality have been used by gentlemen imagine for a moment any oxford man above the rank of a college  scout accosting the young lady to whom he is presumed to be paying his addresses in such insulting words as these  i say blanche whats the matter with pen  has bernard brydges moved off and has the old lady been kicking up a shindy  i could have told them bernard was no go ihe s not made for double harness and with all his pretence of love and sentiment tin is his idol and by jove he s righttake my word for it such expressions would hardly be tolerated in the servants hall at any rate no lady with english blood in her veins would ever admit a second time to her boudoir a brute who could demean himself thus grossly we might quote several other passages of a similar character but we shall content ourselves with one it is an extract from a letter of the same oxford man 441 say old boy dont you wish she may get it the old cat keeps aloof and lets me do much as i like with her pretty and playful little kitten shethe old pussis lpatle dc velours now but i suspect no mouse ever had a sharper run for bis life than i shall have for my liberty when she discovers that i dont mean to let her and her daughter  walk into nie and my good living what fangs and claws then old boy wont it be glorious sport  there are however other perhaps somewhat more venial errors which should also be sedulously avoided on future occasions since they can only be attributable to the ignorance of the writer or the carelessness of the printers  reader the authoress in her dedication to her brother professes  a truly feminine reverence for his finished scholarship c c we think it would not be amiss were she the next time she publishes to submit her proofsheets to that gentlemans critical eye her readers then would probably be spared such sad blunders as these  it was pain to give you up but to give up stultz

captain beresford we are repeatedly told is a comet in the dragoon guards how are we to reconcile this anomaly  however notwithstanding numerous similar errors the intention of the writer is evidently pure and good which is of itself sufficient to redeem a host of faults we trust that the sad fate of the  bride elect may serve to guard many a warm and unsuspecting english heart against such vain delusive triflers as the  men of unmeaning attentions  here so justly denounced,ovel

the book the reader knows that she is a changeling but can only suspect at random whose child she really is an implacable old squire an illfated estate and the two lovers of bosamunda help to make up a story which would be more attractive were it not so heavily charged with fate and the sense of impending calamity hutchinson 6s  the engrafted rose by emma brooke hutchinson 6s here is a good novel at once strong and sound says the author in a passage dealing with the principal heroine rosamunda thoresbye  to be a genuine artist is to view all the parts of existence with a special temperament it is to possess a clue to the meaning of things which others are unaware of to have an unwritten law of ones own by which to test all the manifestations of life and conduct the power of the artist is a light cast everywhere it is this light cast everywhere this continual poetising of reality without distorting its truth which makes the engrafted rose notable among the fiction of the day mrs brookes somewhat melodramatic theme turns upon the fortunes of the old aristocraticbarbarian family of clarels who had lived for centuries at a seat called marske all the placenames and surnames in this novel have a fine northern sound clarel marske hawmonde liedes thirntoft twelves brackenholme ronaldsbiggin we see the working of the clarel blood in three people clement clarel who sold his happiness and that of others to enable him to transmit the family traditions unimpaired bryan hawmonde a distant cousin whose existence is a prolonged defence of his own individuality against the herd of ancestors  within him and eosamunda thoresbye who changed at birth by an unscrupulous midwife lived for twenty years under the impression that she was the daughter of eminently just and respectable millowning parents mrs brook succeeds better with her women and older men than with her young men bryan hawmonde meant to be an elaborate figure is analysed before he has been constructed and his friend earnshaw who marries eosamunda scarcely seems alive the chief blot on the book lies not in the theatrical prologue which is managed with all necessary skill but in the chapter recording eosamundas gipsylike adventures after she has learned the secret of her birth these adventures never occurred they are utterly wronga trick played upon the author by an imagination which approaching the end of a heavy task had become slightly hysteric and unstable but whatever the faults of the engrafted rose impotence is not among them even its crudities and they are not fewhave interest  the engrafted rose by emma brooke 6s hutchinson surely now if not before miss brook has found herself her book  the engrafted rose is a work of unhurried excellence cleverness and a steady certain power impress themselves on us in every chapter and not only cleverness and power but also the understanding which comes from the heart alone there is no single character in the story who has been treated with a moments carelessness  there is not one which could be spared the main motive of the book is the development of a girls strong nature and in accomplishing this the development of other natures weak and strong is skilfully shown events are deftly woven and the plot goes forward with inevitableness  but first and beyond all the author gives her intellect and her care to the depicting of rosamunda the beautiful strongwilled stronghearted  engrafted rose and in the face of this creation the actual story the plot the rights and wrongs of the other characters good as they all are take a secondary place in a different manner but with scarcely less ot talent and ability has been depicted the character of mrs thoresbye the supposed mother of the heroine  ahe is one of the chief delights of the book fresh and unique to the end of the story miss brook indeed convinces us of her powers of observation and insight there is one small point on which we differ from the novelist in the supremest moment of miss emma brookkl from photo by bassano 25 old bond street rosamundas life where she awakens to the flooding realisation that she loves miss brook writes  and then one day she realised that this preoccupation with a single personality was love was passion if miss brook is writing merely of rosamundas case doubtless she knows and is right but if she is speaking generally we feel that she is not right it is a pity or a mercybut she is wrong in five cases out of ten for this absorption this concentration this  preoccupation with a single personality there may be one of a score of reasons exceptionally strongly felt of course but not indubitably love but on the last page of miss brookes book we read  all we need know is that there is a shadow and a misery less in the world perhaps in conclusion we may sayall we need know is that there is a good book and a pleasure more in the world certainly this is a fact,ovel

B3129,['6115771'],  the bankers wife or court and city a sovvl by mus iokk authoress of mothers and daughters  mrs armitage c the wholesome moral which mrs lore has here endeavoured to enforce is epiite sufficient to elevate her book out of thc class of works of mere amusement into that far higher one of useful teaching the excursions of the imagination when they make no further pretensions may elevate the fancy or in other forms refine the feelings pictures of life may teach us to know the world better  portraits of men may make us more intimately acquainted with the various characters of our fellow beings all these have their respective merits but the endeavour to make all these subservient to the higher aim of enforcing a pure morality and teaching a sterling and useful lesson through a pleasurable medium deserves a higher commendation anel this has been mrs gores strenuous endeavour in  the bankers wife commencing with a minor point we must object to the title the bankers wife is not the leading personage of the history unless on the supposition that she suffers most and that quiescently assuredly the saddest shape of endurance  but even this species of preeminence we are obliged to repudiate because though anguish may be deeply engraven on the surface of the heart it is only remorse that eats into its core the banker is the real hero of the tale and is depicted both with spirit and accuracy position in life is the one thing for which men universally strive to struggle up but never to slide downwards is the great object of the world a little higher and yet a little higher is the still stimulating never satisfied desire of the heart without this craving after an everreceding good which is the bane of peace and the poison of present enjoyment man might and would most generally bc satisfied with his lot since it is not so much on existing evil as on desired good that he founds his dissatisfaction  it is in the desire for happiness which is the shadow that he disregards contentment which is the substance thus the banker makes aggrandisement his aim to keep his position in society nay to elevate himself above it be spends his days in toil his nights in care with the means of ample comfort in his power he rejects its enjoyment for the sake of gaining another step higher in thc work with a wife whom mrs gore has with poetical license made quite perfect and children in whom affection might fairly concentrate and centre his feelings are all poisoned at their spring and turned out of their natural channel it is a sad and dark concomitant of almost every species of crime that it is attended by that other of all the basesthypocrisy but few of the sins of thc world walk avowedly unveiled vice still pays that homage to virtue as but seldom tei show an unabashed unblushing front and hence the intimate connexion of the large family of evil to avoid detection commission follows on commission one sin treads on the heels of another to screen it from observance thus the banker influenced solely nt first by the desire to support the position in life which his deceased parent had occupied gradually gives up every hold on rectitude after exhausting his own resources he trenches on the bankinghouse funds and so there follows a long line of actions of increasing turpitude and the lost man struggling to protract his own utter ruin sometimes trembling at the shadow of a straw sometimes blind to overhanging mountains threatening to fall upon and crush him  labouring like a slave at the galleys oar yet strenuously supporting an aspect of ease devoured with the vulture at his heart yet dressing his lip with miiiles at last becomes that saddest of all things his own victim but the character of the banker is admirably contrasted and the moral of the tale powerfully enhanced by the old hast indian nabob a man who saving and excepting his wealth which he is generous enough not to value for its own sake has been bereft of everything near and dear to a heart abounding in love and home affections a wife on whom he doted with that oldfashioned sort of intensity which has become so outree in modern days and sons grown up to an honourable manhood had all been snatched away wearied with the scenes amid which he had amassed his stores of rupees the old nabob had sought his native land to find himself forgotten by the friends ol his younger days and with all the work of the heart if we may be allowed the expression to begin afresh but the impulses of that heart or rather the fullness of its riches outbursting their overnan ow garnerhouse soon surround the aged and bereaved man with a very atmosphere of love making the happiness of others by a nevertiring generosity he receives the gladness back again reflected into his own bosom while thc banker with every social relationship of life gathered around him is yet as joyless as if he were alone in the vast world true it is that the innate nature and not the outward circumstances makes the reality of a mans true condition the moral worked out by the actions of these two opposite characters is theprimary object of the tale and with this purpose our interest in the remaining personages has been kept subordinate while desiring to clo justice to the real merit of the work we are not however blind to its weaker points a little of the vapidness into which mrs gore sometimes falls in her delineations of fashionable life is manifest in the less exciting portions of the narrative  and a matter of some surprise when we are considering the productions of a lady there isa feebleness in those parts which are devoted to sentiment while the strength is all expended on its sterner portion contrary to ordinary example the love affairs are not prominent and whether intentionally or not the characters of the banker and the nabob stand conspicuous throughout upon the whole we consider 4 the bankers wife as one of the best of mrs gores

B1243,['6176712'],  the bride elect 3 vols newby this novel without any very great pretensions or lofty aim certainly merits perusal and that is more than can be predicated of the majority of the works of fiction that have appeared this autumn some indeed are so utterly flimsy that we have not deemed it worth while to honour them even with a passing comment the object of the authoress is to expose thc worthlessness and criminality of that most fri volous and despicable animal a male flirt there certainly can be but one opinion on such a subject consequently no amount of odium will be deemed too great to mark the infamy of such wretches fortunately however at the present day they are not found to exist in any considerable numbers mrs ashton the widow of a general had possessed great beauty which her three daugh tera inherited they resided in a pretty villa at kensington were well connected well introduced and enjoyed sufficient means to enable them to indulge in many of the amenities of life mrs ashtons income being however entailed on a nephew it was incumbent upon herin the phraseology of the worldto get her daughters married as speedily as practicable for her sake as well as their own three fair and accomplished damsels mixing much in society of course elicited considerable admiration and ashton villa was the constant resort of a number of danglersmen as we find them here designated of unmeaning attentions or pertaining to the detrimental race the only check upon these frivolous and injurious intimacies was found in a bachelor uncle a mr percy ashton who looking upon his sisterinlaw as a weak fool and his nieces as romantic simpletons was constantly taking them to task upon the subject the old gentleman estimating in its proper light the conduct of these idlers from having half a century previously occupied himself in a similar disreputable manner a beau of the old school mr percy ashton was a small man very erect and with a head so bald that his very large organs of selfesteem and combativeness stood out in alarming relief he was a very fair man naturally and the few hairs time had not thought it worth his while to steal were like his eyebrows and eyelashes snowy white  his eyes were of the lightest blue and of a keen phosphoric brightness  bis teeth beautifully white and even his hands soft fair and taper as the most delicate ladys and kept with a nicety almost feminine in its precision  for unless the halfmoon of each pink and filbert nail was clearly defined old percy ashton was in a perfect fidget in his dress he was as particular as in his person no speck of dust or mud was ever seen on his black dresscoat of superfine cloth his pantaloonsfor ho scorned trousers  or his glistening shoes his linen seemed as if it had been got up by the fairies so fine so white so clear and the plaits of his frilled shirt and small ruffles so even and minute he was very proud of a fine leg and a small and beautiful foot and with the singular whiteness of his face and hands his snowy linen and exquisite neatness and cleanliness his brilliant brooch and ring and his very courtly and aristocratic bearing no one could pass him unnoticed or fail to regret that so very few specimens remain of the london gentleman of the old school he was a constant visitor at the little villa and a great favourite with his pretty nieces penelope blanche and isabel each of whom had respectively for cavalier bernard brydges trevor templeton and captain beresford although extremely assiduous in flirtation none of these gentlemen are in any degree earnest in their attentions yet each poor girl fancies that her young affections are ardently reciprocated hy her pseudo lover and firmly believes that the all important proposal is only deferred on account of some temporary obstacle bernard brydges is a young man of prcpos sessing exterior fascinating manners small means and no expectations trevor templeton an undergraduate at oxfordthough a very bad specimen of his classresembles brydges in several respects but has the additional advantage of a wealthy uncle with a daughter and a rich advowson both from his earliest youth destined for himself beresford depicted with the ordinary conventional characteristics of that class of army men who have no intention of seeing service is besides a litterateur in a small way with an opinion of himself by no means justified by his successes as an author all three are vain selfish and unprincipled to a degree caring little what pain they may inflict on such hapless maidens as may fall in their way so long as they amuse themselves and add to the boasted number of their victims old percy well aware of the danger his fair protegees are daily incurring cautions them and their mother as to their conduct at a ball and at the same time takes occasion to inveigh strongly against that ungraceful and odious mixture of a jig and a hug the polkaa dance now happily all but banished by the good sense of the community to thirdrate coteries and casinos percy ashton loquitur the polka at the last ball i went toa fancy balla powdered beau of george the seconds time was polking with a pretty swiss peasant with braided black hair anda bunch of scarlet flowers in her bosom  her black hair was powdered too before the end of the polka and on his white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold the print of her scarlet flowers was taken as by transfer i leave you to judge what sort of a dance that must have been how the ladys and gentlemans heads must have come together and how close must have been the contact to leave on his breast the print of the flowers in hers oh its odious its degrading its indecent even and worse still its vulgar ugly inelegant a girl never looks so awkwarknever seems so littleas when shes being jogged along in the hideous innovation on all our national feelingsi will not say prejudices in england too its so badly done such a clumsy exaggeration such a caricature oh ive no patience with it it has been remarked that since the polka came into fashion matrimony has gone out spinsters are alarmingly on the increase and i dont wonder at it as the cleverest woman i know said to me at that same ballthe girls of the present day begin where we used to leave off i e with an embrace the severest thing that has been said yet well said isabel i quite agree with uncle percy and that is the reason i never will dance the polka the authoress is especially severe against this dance and on another occasion observes  i do believe that odious polka has put the finishing stroke to womans influence and mans reverence for the sex it has broken down the wild sweetbriery fence it is so much to beautys interest to keep unimpaired it throws her a cheap burthen into the arms of a succession of supercilious puppies and it is so very inelegant a dance that she loses caste not only with her partner but with all the men who look on to sneer but not to admire  well it is a vulgar ugly dance enough and ouch a bore i dont care how soon it goes out im no very devoted squire of dames and really i do not wish to carry a heavy girl in a sort of halfjig

will be to make myself worthy of the honour you have done me had mr addington been more experienced in womankind he would have known that this kind fluent and amiable language was not that of a fond weak womans heart but of a clever womans head there was none of the faltering confusion the fascinating tautology the fearful joythe fear the shame the bliss almost painful in its intensity the thoughts too deep for utterance the feelings all too delicate for words mr addington was far too much in love all banker as he was to have a notion at that moment except of his own rapture and his brides condescension he tried to take the hand she extended to him he tried to speak his gratitude but he was far too much overcome for eloquence and so after exclaiming  oh miss ashton iyouall the honourforgive me i have loved you so longin secretso very long so very fondlyiii he hastily took out his handkerchief buried his face in it and burst into tears penelope felt very uncomfortabletouched she certainly wasbut ashamed too of feeling so little when the man she had accepted as a husband felt so much with his handkerchief still to his face he rose and went to the window and for some minutes penelope could see by the heaving of his breast as she stole a view of him en profile that ho was mastering great emotion  he is to be my husband she thought and therefore i must act as if i loved him and perhaps what is at first assumed may become real ah how would it be if oh bernard but i must not will not be so weak so wicked alas i will give my heart with my hand at least i will so

pinmoney miss ashton in her new character receives an invitation to pass a few weeks with the mother of her  futur a pragmatical disagreeable rheumatic old woman whose thoughts and affections are entirely centred in her son during her stay at addington lodge a few miles from brighton penelope discovers that bernard brydges between whom and herself all communication has recently ceased is residing at brighton she contrives and obtains more than one interview with the man who still holds undivided possession of her heart hoping that she may yet induce him to aid her in escaping from a fate in spite of its brilliancy becoming more odious the nearer it approaches she could bear that bernard should know she was going to marry mr addington she could not endure the thought that he should fancy she loved him she wished to be embalmed in his memory as a victim she could not tolerate the thought of figuring there as the contented prosperous affectionate wife of a middleaged banker and yet how could she undeceive him  had he not seen her weeping by mr addingtons side his arm round her waist her head on his shoulder what agony she felt at the idea that he would never believe that she had sacrificed herself it soon transpires however that brydges real object in haunting the same part of the country as his poor inamorata is not alas his love for her but a strong affection he has lately conceived for the shekels of miss addington a spinster of mature age frivolous disposition and very small personal attractions but with a reputed fortune of 70000 he contrives to obtain an introduction to the mother and an invitation to the same house in which penelope is staying poor miss ashton suddenly misinterprets the vile deceivers motives one day looking from her window mistaken motives she saw dora ridiculously overdressed and assuming the most jaunty coquetry of manner sporting about the lawn and along the shrubberies with bernard brydges she was followed by a little snowwhite french poodle that penelope had never seen before and which lier jealous heart suggested bernard had perhaps given but as she dressed herself in a new and elegant costume and as the glass reflected her cheeks hushed with emotion her eyes tull of passionate fire her form so proud and so perfect and the beauty over which love shed a lustre love alone can shed she contrasted her own exquisite grace and beauty with the little unshapen form gaudy attire sandy hair weak eyes and quaint absurdity of the figure ambling by bernards side and she felt ashamed of her own momentary jealousy had she in weighing herself and dora in the scale just put in seventy thousand pounds on doras sidethat sum in which bernard brydges whole soul is in reality wrapped uphow different would her deduction have been  poor dear bernard how he must love me to tolerate her and her odious advancesmiserable attempt at coquetry and wearisome affectations for my sake but ai in my side wlat nave  not entlureu tor him alas alas how is it all to end i must understand ms scheme i cannot play this part much longer but at auy rate i must be all kindness tonight for what a penance has he not endured for rae today various notes are interchanged penelope being eager to fathom brydges meaning while he is only anxious to lull her suspicions till he can elope with the  fortune that has awakened his cupidity one of these epistles to bernard brydges in penelopes hand is at last discovered and causes a frightful catastrophe the unlucky missive insisted on a meeting and an explanation early the following morning miss ashton appointed the place and she had determined to impart to her quondam admirer her resolution to break off the match with mr addington and to insist on bernards leaving her for ever unless he chose to accept the sacrifice she was so eager to make and to elope with her himself bernard brydges had however arranged a meeting of much more importance in his eyes mr addington and his mother came to the trysting place instead the eclaircis9ement it was a summerhouse that overlooked the road to london she waited for some time in miserable anxiety and impatience and bernard brydges did not come she began to fear he had deceived her burning shame dyed her cheeks anger and despair lighted her eyes and fired her breast she was about to leave the spot when the sound of carriagewheels in though road beneath attracted her attention  a postchaise and four dashed by the blinds were drawn down but one was suddenly raised and the face of dora looked up at the summerhouse yes dora waved her hand triumphantly to the bride elect bernard brydges shrank back in the carriage and hastily pulled down the blind penelope did not see his face but she did see his hand his white kid glove proclaiming the bridegroom oh there was not a doubt not a miserable doubt left he had been trifling with her keeping her quiet making a tool of her his sole object being that miserable halfwitted heiressno no there could be no doubt hannah is in the rumble with some jeering valet and both look up aud both laugh yes she sees them both laugh as fixed like a statue of despair her hair streaming in the damp morning air her form rigid her lips ana cheeks marblewhite and her hands tightly pressed upon her tortured bosom she stands at the entrance of that bower still looking wildly after the carriage and four round which rise such clouds of dustemblems as bernard thinks and whispers to the enraptured dora of what he would compel her brother to come down with slowly penelope turns with shivering horror and prepares to leave the spot as she does so she utters a faint cry for the first objects that meet her eye are mr addington and his mother she sees in a moment that they know all he is ghastly pale but stern and haughty and in his just indignation he looks almost dignified in his hands he holdsoh god yes it is her own note he held it out to her she tried to take it but a sharp cry burst from her lips her eyes flashed wildly all her features worked her limbs became convulsed she attempted to speak but could not articulate presently her knees shook her arms dropped and she fell heavily on the ground mr and mrs addington looked at each other they knew not what to do  do not touch her do not condescend to touch her reptile that she is said mrs addington  i

brokenhearted no doubt but ready to bestow that broken heart on you when the sight of ber own vile note iu your hand overcame even her treachery her imprudence and her own conscienco struck her down at your feet this is the true state of the case my poor poor boy and you have only to thank heaven for an escape which to me seems like a miracle vouchsafed to save you the poor girl after a terrible illness recovers her health but her reason has fled for ever brydges finds that his wifes fortune is notas lu fondly anticipated at her sole disposal but entirely dependent on the will of her brother who generously allows the newlymarried couple 2007 a month to be paid to her so long as they lived happily together but to be paid to her alone if a separation should at any time take place between them we shall leave our readers to discover for themselves the histories of isabel and blanche together with the fate of their two graceless lovers merely adding that the respectable banker unites himself and his fortune to the amiable daughter of a poor clergyman the poor girl having long secretly entertained a passion for him the novel is written in an amusing style though here and there we detect errors not unfrequent in works of the class to which this pertains the more prominent attributes of the male characters in order that they may appear more striking are overdrawn and the language they are now and then made to utter is such as could never in reality have been used by gentlemen imagine for a moment any oxford man above the rank of a college  scout accosting the young lady to whom he is presumed to be paying his addresses in such insulting words as these  i say blanche whats the matter with pen  has bernard brydges moved off and has the old lady been kicking up a shindy  i could have told them bernard was no go ihe s not made for double harness and with all his pretence of love and sentiment tin is his idol and by jove he s righttake my word for it such expressions would hardly be tolerated in the servants hall at any rate no lady with english blood in her veins would ever admit a second time to her boudoir a brute who could demean himself thus grossly we might quote several other passages of a similar character but we shall content ourselves with one it is an extract from a letter of the same oxford man 441 say old boy dont you wish she may get it the old cat keeps aloof and lets me do much as i like with her pretty and playful little kitten shethe old pussis lpatle dc velours now but i suspect no mouse ever had a sharper run for bis life than i shall have for my liberty when she discovers that i dont mean to let her and her daughter  walk into nie and my good living what fangs and claws then old boy wont it be glorious sport  there are however other perhaps somewhat more venial errors which should also be sedulously avoided on future occasions since they can only be attributable to the ignorance of the writer or the carelessness of the printers  reader the authoress in her dedication to her brother professes  a truly feminine reverence for his finished scholarship c c we think it would not be amiss were she the next time she publishes to submit her proofsheets to that gentlemans critical eye her readers then would probably be spared such sad blunders as these  it was pain to give you up but to give up stultz hoby verey et cetera omnibus  would be greater pain still  bernard brydges possessed all the minor virtues in perfection punctuality politeness neatness order cleanliness et cetera paribus   lamour

captain beresford we are repeatedly told is a comet in the dragoon guards how are we to reconcile this anomaly  however notwithstanding numerous similar errors the intention of the writer is evidently pure and good which is of itself sufficient to redeem a host of faults we trust that the sad fate of the  bride elect may serve to guard many a warm and unsuspecting english heart against such vain

B6104,['9446662'],  1 abots cleve or can it be proved a norel  new novels 3 vols tinsley brothersit is very seldom that a novel from a new hand is so free from marks of inexperience as  abbots cleve yet we must suppose it to be a first effort since it displays neither an authors name nor a list of former works on the titlepage we hope most sincerely that the author will not like many young writtrs of the day fall into the mistake of issuing a fresh novel every three months but will bestow on each subsequent production the same amount of careful industry which is conspicuous in the present work we are induced t offer this warning from a consideration of the worthlessness of the machinemade stories of several authors who started with no inconsiderable promise two or three years ago the author of abbots cleve is too good a writer to be lost in this way  his maiden work is calculated to raise expectation to a high pitch and we trust that he will not disappoint the reading public hereafter the heroine of the story florence cleve makes her first appearance at a snug little suburban residence where mrs thornleigh a friend of her deceased fathers family has educated her with her own daughter kate but although she is thus humbly brought up florence is heir presumptive to a splendid estate in    shire which is to come to her in case the present owner her cousin augusta dies without children shortly after the opening of the story florence is invited to take up her abode with her cousin  and she feels a pardonable pride on entering the home of her fathers though she enters it only as a poor relation the master of the house is count almonti an italian nobleman with innumerable quarterings but infinitesimal estates who has married partly for love and partly fur money but has found to his bitter disappointment that neither augustas love nor her money can ever be his  augusta has in fact long since given her heart to eustace vaughan a young man of good but rather remote expectations whom her deceased mother bent upon her acquiring a title has not allowed herto marry in short the foolish motherhns preferred a penniless count to a penniless english gentleman so the italian has married a woman who cares nothing for him aud whom he very soon finds to be devoted to another about this time florence comes to live at abbots cleve and finds her foreign cousin courteous smiling and goodhumoured she knows nothinp of his grievances  to bis wife as to all he is kind and attentive while the countess on the other hand is vain illtemjiered and capricious who would suspect that the latter was marked down as a victim and that her mild and polished husband was to be the assassin after a time augusta falls ill and is confined to her bed  she becomes nervous and weak and reveals to florence a notion which seems absurd and fanciful namely that some mysterious being steals into her room and hovers about her sick bed at dead of night she implores her young cousin to bide herself in a dressingroom hard by and to remain there all night and see what happens it is thus that florence learns the guilt of the count and it is thus also that she herself being seen by an earlyrising servant to handle the medicinebottles and then to leave the room hurriedly is believed by him to have poisoned the countess for the sake of her rich inheritance this servant mat turner becomes the tyrant of her life the worst point being that he is not a mere conspirator but one who fully and honestly believes her to be a murderess appearances being in fact very much against her and her explanation being so extraordinary as to seem quite incredible the count loses house lands and position by the death of his wife while florence gains all three by the same event and she bees therefore with bitter regret how difficult it would be to make her story believed and consents to purchase by money and other favours the silence of the surly domestic the miseries arising from this concealment can only be briefly described here florence is married to her devoted lover bernard thornleigh and for a short time she forgets her apprehensions of discovery in the happiness of wedded life but the insolence and illtemper of turner soon put an end to the pleasant daydream as bernards suspicions are aroused and by degrees he loses all confidence in his wife at last he forces the secret from turner and already predisposed against florence he believes her to be guilty of the dreadful crime of which she is accused henceforth he cannot bear her presence and he leaves home and fortune to begin life over again in a distant clime nothing at this stage can seem more hopeless than the position of affairs luckily however there is a resolute young lady named kate thornleigh who is excessively indignant at all this and believes every word of the story which poor florence is at last induced to tell her now the imperious kate has a very obedient lover one richard austin who is rich in money but humble in mind and who wor ships the penniless kate with an ardour which makes him ready to attempt impossibilities at her command this devoted man is very curtly informed that he can never hope to marry his adored one unless he succeeds in sifting out everything and clearing florences character the only way to effect this is to force a full confession from the count who has long since disappeared and as it must all be done secretly so as not to bring before the world the fearfully suspicious circumstances involved in florences own account of the matter it requires no little ingenuity to devise a plan by which it may be brought about the author deserves much praise for the skill with which this portion of the book is managed the chain of evidence is so novel and striking that the mind is kept in constant surprise and expectation yet the links are so neatly fitted together that it would be difficult to find a flaw or hitch in it to give the details of richards plans would be to destroy the readers pleasure in watching their gradual development but we may venture to mention that after much anxiety he is proudly triumphant at last and extorts a full confession a la fosco from the double murderer of vaughan and augusta the feature of a written confession extracted from an italian count must of course remind every reader of the woman in white but count almonti is a very different character from count fosco his object is not plunder but the preservation of his family honour which he considers would be destroyed by a suit in the divorce court but will survive any number of secret murders he is a criminal of course but not a criminal of a vulgar type and in his own eyes perhaps not a criminal at all his error does not lie in cupidity or unkindness and although certainly a man of deep prejudices and apparently an unbeliever he would probably be dangerous to none but his enemies the other characters are very well drawn each being stamped with a clear individuality the dignified kate awes down her timid lover by a selfpossession not unmixed with severity yet she nearly loses the game by exposing her hand to almonti and then for the first time she begins to respect richard for the plain commonsense in which he is clearly her superior as the plot goes on she appreciates more and more his merit and devotion and when at last he obtains singlehanded the victory which he has nearly missed through her impetuosity she ceases to despise him for his excessive modesty and recognises him cordially as the lord and master of her fate the minor characters are well fitted in to their subordinate places and some of them show a good deal of dry humour it is some time since we have seen a novel equal to abbots cleve in the several requisites of variety of character completeness of mechanism vigour and correctness of language and sustained and legitimate interest,ovel

B108,"['3172289', '6745931']",  american wives and english husbands the title of the bigger book covers the main incident of the lesser but 1 his fortunate grace is evidently not a study for nor a pendent to  american wives and english husbands the scene of the shorter story is laid in new york and mostly among easterners whom we gather mrs atherton does not like and whose vices and weaknesses she presents let us hope slanderously she speaks for the american of the south and the west and is almost as sensitive over the european lumping of the new world racial differences as a scot when he is looked on as a mere englishman the passages in the history of miss augusta forbes heiress to millions are presented to show how coldblooded businesslike and determined a young new york maiden can be in her pursuit of social position in englahd true the heiresss mother a southerner is nearly as keen in the matter but she is otherwise an agreeable and very affectionate person the longer book is a lovestory the villainess is an american to be sure raised in chicago but though she is powerful enough to bring on the catastrophe she cannot divert our attention from the heroine lee the western beauty and not too much of an heiress for lee let us be grateful since she means a much pleasanter atmosphere than can be breathed in any other of the books of this talented writer not too much of an heiress we have said but mrs athertons heroines demand a thick luxury for their graces and forces to develop in patience sparhawk and lee both know hardship in their childhood but that poverty can mean anything but starvation of the mind the soul the senses never seems to occur to this observer of life and lee is rescued from it at the age of eleven that her conquest of the highest circles may

clumsy title strikes a keynote this story like the last deals with the theory or practice of angloamerican intermarriage mrs atherton would protest one gathers against the blunt judgement which lumps all american wives into a single unflattering category after all she points out to us there is a world of difference between say your raw western heiress and the southern woman of good californian family with a century or two of delicate breeding behind her the former does not beseem a coronet the latter may meet an english noble with a pride of race equal to his own such a one is lee tarlton

B1097,"['8522600', '2753650']",  i my little girl a novel by the authors of  readymo mortiboy tinsley brothers  this novel maintains the high standard of the author former work it was evident to the readers of that tae that they would be likely to make progress in one of two directions that of an increase of romantic interest in the composition of the narrative or of a completer suborda tion of this element to the political and religion specs lations which found utterance in their former work though these are not wanting in the present novel which preserves the leading characteristic of the last reversee for true goodness and contempt for hypocrisy the advnce is mainly in the first direction the plot is original a might be expected and mainly hinges upon a very snmgular misunderstanding the position of the heroine  my little girl is an anomalous one she is the ward of a man who is not only unmarried but young enough to love her and to inspire a reciprocal attachment when the charming lollie is at last unmistakably grownup this fact of their mutual love is by no means clear to either party their relation has hitherto been that of tutor and pupil and no other has suggested itself to their minds hartley venn however now begins to have an uneasy sen sation that his ward had better be married and that of course he shall be glad to see her married the expression of this feeling on his part combined with the girls own unconsciousness of the real nature of her affection for her guardian produce a singular result the conversation in which after a consultation with his sister he propounds his plan for the happiness of his  little girl is worth quoting  and so after a long talk with my sister    she gave meo lollie the answer to the question i have been troubling myself with for so long she says my child that there is only one way you must be comfortably and honourably married her very words  i mr venn  the girl looked up and laughed in his face with those merry blue eyes of hers  what have i done that i must be married    doiit raise difficulties lollie he said in a feeble way after all the trouble we had in getting sukey to give us a right answer too   she laughed again i suppose i am not to be married unless i like why noi suppose not no oh certainly not but you will like wont you  and who am i to marry  why you see lollie he grew confidential  the fact is i dont know jones wont do    oh dear no he is tootooundignified mr lynn certainly not is there any one else  not at present my child but we shall see let us lok around us london is a great place if london wont do there is all england besides the rest of great britain berwickoftweed and the colonies after this expression of her guardians wishes regarding her settlement in life lollie falls in with the wicked hero  of the book philip durnford who eventually persuades her though she is not the least in love with him to run away with him as a pleasant surprise to the kiad guardian who was so anxious to see her married the unconscious lovemaking between hartley venn and his ward is so prettily described that this wild step of poor lollies is almost as great a shock to the reader as we may suppose it to have been to mr venn the marriage ia which  the little girl  has entangled herself is further a mock marriage devised by a very welldescribed and decidedly original character a drunken old scotch domifie who has  gone to the bad  with great energy and perseverance and employs himself in assisting philip durnford to take the downward course it would be unfair to eto the circumstances by which happiness is at last restored to mr venn and his too obedient pupil and our space does not permit us to notice the other interesting characters 1ad the bookarthur durnford his ladylove and philip durnfords erring but highminded mother they ar well worthy of a closer acquaintance and the various vicissitudes of their history and that of  my little gil form one of the most attractive stories that have sppyted this season aajy w   a d  i my little girl a novel by the authors of  ready money m ortiboy tinsley brothers there is decided originality in this work and on the whole it is very considerably above the average the interest howvever is less dependent on the story itself or the characters introduced than on certain adjunctsit might almost be said on the numerous digressionswhich though they may impede the course of the narrative certainly render the work what it is a production of marked power interest and individuality in a word the writers excel more in description than in the construction and elaboration of a plot less in telling a story or delineating character than in delineating certain phases of life and philosophising in a tone which if slightly cynical is indisputably fresh and suggestive the story opens effectively in the island of palmiste better known as prince georges island and after a few pages of brilliantlywritten descriptive matter we find ourselves transported to the estate of fontainebleau where george durnford an excavalry officer is discovered sorrowing for the early and sudden loss of his wife adrienne suddenly there appears on the scene a young mulatto woman marie wyname formerly durnfords mistress who having come for the purpose of triumphing over his sprrow ultimately relents and leaves the house with the intention of proceeding to europe where having a fine voice she purposes adopting the musical profession it is at this point that the story really commences the novel concerning itself for the most part with the fortunes of george durnfords two sons phil the illegitimate child of marie and arthur the heir to the estates an evil genius of a somewhat commonplace type is introduced in the form of a mr macintyre a scotch tutor who by means of forgery professes to establish phils legitimacy and amongst other villanies celebrates what is intended to be a mock marriage between his worthless protege and the  little girl lollie from whom the story derives its title phil durnford a black sheep first an officer in a line regiment then a gambler a  welsher and a drunkard ends his days in the island of palmiste to which he returns in desperation and where he dies in his mothers arms arthur a weak indecisive quixotic and rather colourless character falls under the imperious sway of madeleine de villeroy vwo born in the island of palmiste becomes on visiting england an enthusiast in the cause of the poor to whose relief and moral elevation she devotes herself body and soul the little girl though discarded by phil durnford who rudely tells her that she is only his mistress is eventually righted and on the whole the narrative is brought to a satisfactory con clusion undeniably there are dull pages in the book the meetings of the  chorus and jones nonsense verses for instance being far from interesting but broadly speaking the novel is one to be read and in spite of its somewhat unengaging characters and loosely constructed plot has the very decided merit of being written in a pure vigorous manly style the dialogue occasionally reaches to brilliancy there are bursts of true eloquence there are many descrip tive passages of great beauty there are some highly dramatic and effective situations the authors write from head and heart not ftop s memory stocked with other peoples ideas they have a command of genuinse pathos and it is hard to read such passages as those descriptive of lollies wanderings phils death and the shipwreck unmoved the language too is always goodterse vigorous and free from affectation and no fault can be found with the work on the score of its moral tone which is undeniably pure and elevated as we remarked before the strength of the collaborateurs seems to be in description rather than invention some of the incidents being forced and the characters acting at times in an unreal spasmodic fashion but the work displays considerable knowledge of life in its various phases and is most remarkable for its genuine literary and brain power earnestness and originality  my little girl is decidedly a remarkable production and as such wve commend it to the attention of readers who prefer something more bracing than the con ventional twaddle of the circulating library a peculiar feature of the book are the headings to the chapters often wooden and seldom very correctly drawn they have yet a subtle charm being full of grace quaint humour and delicate suggestiveness,ovel

the cruel retribution of the sins of though parents upon the children is worked out with the pitiless fatality of a greek tragedy a young englishman of high fa mil and expectations the son of a weak father and a hard worldlyminded mother who have both united to indulge flatter and spoil him goes to italy in a fit of wilfulness whilst he is thinking that he will study art and paint the great picture which is to confirm all the promise he has given of becoming a great artist and proving himself a man of genius he falls in love with a beautiful english girl whom he sees by accident at some church service he finds that she belongs to a family consisting of the father an invalid the mother this daughter and a young girl her companion they live in a mysterious seclusion absolutely isolated from society in an old palazzo in bologna their only acquaintances are the marchesa who lives or starves iu a distant corner of her ancestral halls and her son guido lamberti the marchesa a bigot under the influence of her priest and the son a young italian of the present day one of the best types of his nation the period is 1848 when the hopes of italy were high for deliveranceare both admirable types of character guido lamberti loves the english girlgilda courtneysilently devotedly steadfastly she loves him like a young girl without knowing it or selfquestioning of any kind sara gisborne her companion a young girl adopted from charity by the courtneys loves him too she is the dark angel of the story one of those black flashing exceptional beings who have one virtue linked with a thousand crimes whose natural element is in melodramas and french novels and whoso bodily sresentment may be seen at the port stlartin laurence carr of carrlyon the hero having seen gilda and fallen in love resolves after the fashion of young men who have been spoilt and who have never had occasion to deny themselves the indulgence of a single whim or emotion in the course of their lives to see more of her and casts about for means of becoming acquainted with the courtneys to this end he displays some ingenuity and by means of an accident created for the purpose by him he gets admitted into their domestic interior the play of the different characters is extremely well delineated mr courtney the father a coldmannered reserved highlybred english gentleman evidently in a wrong positionhis wife delicate sad blameless  but struggling with the influence of some past event which overshadows her life are both very cleverly drawn and give the impression of having been taken from the life the inci dents aro few the interest of the story turns entirely upon the action of the characters upon each other and the influence of their qualities upon the lives and fortunes of each other which is all very skilfully and truly managed carr becomes confirmed in his intention of proposing for gilda in spite of his ignorance of all her connexions and antecedents partly by the discovery of their sudden intention to quit bologna and partly by an illtimed and extremely detestable letter from his mother gilda might not have been likely to acquiesce in his intentions had not sara gisborne to get rid of her rival used all the treacherous and unscrupulous arts which black angels and demon heroines have used from time immemorial she persuades her that guido not only does not love her but that he avoids her hwing suspected her love for him and poor gilda who is guileless as a child recoils in trouble and dismay she works on guidos firide and sense of honour and tells him all the ies she thinks convenient she works artfully upon carr himself she discovers that she herself is the natural daughter of mr courtney and she obtains possession of the family secret of gildas parents this secret is quite dark enough to deter any man who did not love with a devotion and strength of character very rare in the world from seeking their daughter for a wife mrs courtney was a woman of high rank and had been the heroine of a terrible tragedy and cause celcbre she had eloped from her husband her lover had shot him dead in a duel and this was the reason why they were obliged to live in such profound seclusion under a false name gilda of course knows nothing of all this her mother is more than repentant if sorrow could efface crime her father dying of ennui and regret he is anxious to have his daughter married and though he would have preferred poor guido as the one who would have been less likely to be outraged by the knowledge of facts still as guido has drawn back carr cannot be called ineligible and mr courtney resolves to accept him his wife wishes the whole truth revealed courtney like a man decides that it is unnecessary he merely impresses on young carr that the intimacy and proposal had been of his own seeking all the parties act up to their own respective characters and the tragedy of the story results from the natural influence of some quality not exactly reprehensive or some other quality which like the sulphur and saltpetre in gunpowder are harmless until brought together when the result is at the mercy of a casual spark carr marries gilda who is a charming and adorable creature she has told him the truth about guido so far as she knows it herself and then she sets herself to efface the dream of the past and she succeeds it has often been remarked that the daughters of those women who have lapsed from virtue are brought up more carefully and sternly than the daughters of mothers who only know evil by hearsay and mrs courtney has expiated too bitterly the sin of her youth to have left gilda unguarded guido goes away to fight the battles of nis country but not before sara gisborne has made an avowal of her love and been refused in the most chivalrous but decided manner possible being a determined young woman she is not to be repulsed but bides her time and makes use of the knowledge she has obtained to wring terms from mr courtney who dies under the sudden shock of her threats and taunts following up her advantage she wrings from the widow nearly every farthing she possesses and then disguising herself as a boy she enlists as a recruit in the army of charles albert in the same regiment with guido mrs courtney left almost destitute has to accept a home with her daughter and then occurs one of the vital incidents of the story aud one which though possible is too exceptional to make it probable gilda and mrs courtney wish to visit the hospital where the wounded have been taken after the battle of novara carr unwillingly consentshe leaves his wife and mother to go inside and awaits them guido has been wounded and he is the tenant of the first bed they pass beside him sits sara gisborne gilda hears his ravings and recognises that he has always loved her and that sara has lied it is too late now and the pure womanly way in which she clings to the husband she has taken shutting out all regret or thought of the past is very delicately drawn and is charming unfortunately carr hears accidentally that guido is in thc hospital appearances are against gilda but this time her perfect truth and frankness disarm his suspicious nature but the first grain of sand has been thrown in to trouble the waters carrs mother comes to visit them and the mischief and discomfort from the incompatible natures of all the parties are very true to life in the midst of this the malignant jealousy of sara gisborne comes in maddened that gilda has heard the truth of guidos love for her she writes to carrs mother the family secret connected with her sons wife this is well managed the reader is never bewildered into palliating the guilt of the unhappy mother but the sympathy and pity that are roused are none the less strong the interview between carr and mrs courtney is the most powerful scene in the book the secret is kept from gilda but the evil influence it exercises cannot be averted her husband loves her but he cannot forget the blood that she inherits and doubts whether the evil principle has not been entailed upon her along with it and he never really trusts her afterwards sara disappears and leads a life of more than questionable repute till she marries an old mau who is a duke leaving her a widow under some suspicion but she has become rich fashionable and a lionne in society watching over guido in the distance and still biding her time guido poor fellow gets into the way of starvation and in a not very probable or possible way becomes again mixed up with gilda and her husband and again rouses the latent jealousy of carr which has never been quite extinguished gilda has no suspicion of the web of false appearances and false inferences to which her innocent and natural conduct towards guido gives rise it is the curse of her parents sin that is working upon her the working up of the dinotimenl is very interesting but not very probable but the reader will not stop to be critical poetical justice is executed on sara gisborne and laurence carr is left at the end a sadder and a better man than he ever had been before this novel is of a higher class and of greater power than the general run of novels we have indicated the main incidents but it is in the working out of the details that the skill of the author is most shown,ovel

B8976,['4382377'],  anne hereford whatever may have been said in dispraise of the hoational school of novelist at any rate it is something to indl book the three volumes of which can be read not only without weariuesa and disgust but with positive interest and ply  anne heetd a hotel by xm hemly wool 2 b a mrs henry wood is not a great novelist nor is she in any sense a great artist but she has in a high degree the power of storytelling as a rule the difficulties into which the dramiatis personae of her novels get are so gratuitously unnecessary and the ease by which a word on their part would extricate them from their troubles so apparent that the reader loses all belief in the reality of the incident and is simply annoyed at the stupidity of the hero and heroine there is too a want of truth in the minute details which is never found in a really highclass novel when we read for instance that the stolen will was written on parchment all belief in the will and in the theft departs the reader knows as a matter of fact that wills are not made on parchments and one little slip destroys all illusion in a moment mrs henry wood probably has never made her will and knows nothing of such matters nor is a woman supposed to know anything of them but then she should not write about them or she should get her ms revised by some one of wider experience than herself there is one svbject however of which mrs henry wood ought to know something and that is the character of women with a certain type of woman mrs henry wood seems to be familiar it is not a high type certainlybut one rather weakminded gossiping and decidedly vulgar sometimes the authoress appears to have a painful doubt whether her heroine is a wellbred gentlewoman or a lady as mrs henry wood and the servantmaids would say and then she is obliged to tell her readers in so many words that her heroine is a lady and many times has that assurance to be reiterated in the course of the book unhappily with little effect upon the mind of the reader whatever comfort it may bring to the authoress anne hereford the heroine introduces herself to us as a child of eleven years old 1 a thoughtful gentle child with a smooth pale forehead earnest eyes and long dark eyelashes that swept her cheek george eliot has told us that long eyelashes are not necessarily indicative of high moral qualities so anne herefords eyes and eyelashes seem to have meant nothing in particular there was one thing about her that had a decided value she was a  carew of keppecarew this was the gorgons head before which her enemies fell prostrate however lowly miss herefords position at any time she had but to unveil the awful keppecarew genealogy and her triumph was instantaneous the carews of keppecarew had under some inscrutable dispensation of providence been suffered to degenerate into the female line and the three daughters of the last of the carevrs were somewhat unfortunate in their matrimonial relationsbips there was mrs hereford the mother of the heroine who had married an officer without money and who died a widow leaving anne unprovided for and in the charge of her sister mrs edwin barley this lady had married mr edwin barley for his money and being young and goodlooking while her husband was elderly and ngly she amused herself by strong flirtations with her husbands ward philip king and with her guest george heneage all these people are incessantly acting as spies upon one anotherphilip king jealously watching george heneage and mr edwin barley leaving his shooting parties to spy upon both while anne hereford is generally behind a curtain or a tree watching the whole of this agreeable household the result of a system of espionage conducted by men with guns in their hands is that philip king is shot dead in the park close to anne herefords feet george heneage and mr edwin barley both appearing with their guns coming from the direction from which the shot was fired as mr edwin barley comes into a large fortune by the death of his ward and as he was a man with an overwhelming love of money the reader is left in doubt which of the two fired the fatal shot however heneage disappears and is pursued with unrelenting vindictiveness by mr barley mrs barley rushing out in the night air in her evening dress to find heneage caught what is vulgarly called her death of cold but nmakes unknown to her husband a will leaving her fortune to anne hereford mr barleys housekeeper in her zeal for her master finds the will on the night of mrs barleys death and destroys it the will having disappeared mr barley refuses to provide for anne hereford who goes to a school in paris and meets therea miss ohandos among the pupils this young lady runs away from ute schooi and marries a mr alfred de melise much to the disgust of her distinguished mother lady chandos madame de meliuse who is rather flighty soon tyres of her equally fighty husband and then begs to return to the amcestral home of chandos for a visit of indefinite length monsieur reluctantly consents on condition that his wife takes anne hereford as a companion on arriving at cbandos house it is clear that anne is de trod and that a mystery hangs over the mansion which is shut in by trees and carefully kept from the view of strangers of course the mystery is that george heneage alias george chandos the supposed murderer of philip king and a son of lady chandos is concealed in the house this concealment affords miss hereford abundant opportunity for exercising he peeping propensities an opportunity which she does not neglect and thereby occasions considerable uneasiness to the other son of lady chandos usually called mr chandos with whom anne falls in love the exercise of the affections of course causes the young lady to grow sentimental and talk of skies and trees and clouds and dying and accordingly we have the following new and beautiful sentiment the morning lad been very lovely the evening was setting in less so a sighing wind whistled amidst the trees clouds passed rapidly over the faca of the sky and the autumn leaves fell and were whirled about the paths did it ever strike you that there is some thing melancholy in these dying leaves p many people like autumn best of the fbur seasons but i think there is in it a great deal of fadress it brings our own autumn of life too forcibly to the mind as though leaves of the trees decay and fall and die so must we when our time shall come but the indefatigable mr edwin barley is on the watch for his victim and takes a house close to the park gates that he may the more easily discover the whereabouts of george chandos who is in the mean time closely shut up in a wing of the house dying of consumption a few hours after his death mr barley succeeds in his quest only to find that his vengeance has been defeated and that george chandos who shot philip king half by accident and half by design is out of the reach of human justice mlr chandos becomes sir harry chandos and marries anne hereford who receives her aunts fortune from the repentant edwin barley so that everything is made pleasant and comfortable in the end as we have said the story is very readable and there are occasional gleams of humour take the following george chandos has ventured to take a walk by night among the trees of the park and has been seen and taken for a ghost by the servants  but the thing is incredible persisted harriet  let us suppose for arguments sake that it is mr chandoes ghost that walks what does it come for lizzie dene    i

B6380,"['8748464', '6717463']",  altiora peto literature by laurence oliphant 4 parts blackwood  sons ix altiora peto as in piccadilly mr oliphant presents himself to the novelreading world as one made up of equal parts of theosophist and social cynic mystic and man of the world the student of earthly character and manners and the student of divine mysteries he has an abundance of wit great knowledge of men and women and society and as much of though satirical habitthe tendency to attack with laughter and to make unpleasant or improper things ridiculousas any one since lord beaconsfield and to these qualities he adds an interest in the spiritual and a conviction as to its adaptability to purposes of fiction only to be paralleled in the work of professional preachers like dr george mac donald to the unregenerate eye in fact he presents a set of contradictions a confusion of contrasts at once amusing and respectable he appears as a kind of latterday apostle with a patmos of his own somewhere in pall mall and a peculiar wilderness in the very shadow of decimus burtons arch in one chapter the reader recognises him for the founder and editor of the most elegant and scholarly of satirical prints in another for the evangelist of anew a westend messiah he reminds you of blougram and of gigadibs in turn like the bishop he is an adept in balzac  the new edition fifty volumes long and like the literary man lie has long since tested his first plough and studied his last chapter of st john we prefer him as the bishop so to speak  for as it seems to us he is apt as gigadibs to be a trifle vague and transcendental he discourses of society with an ease a grace and an authority which are really admirable in  expounding of mysteries in treating of psychical revolutions and spiritual ambitions and successes he is far less successful in the one part of his tfork he is found to know exactly what to say and exactly how to say it in the other it is clear that if his convictions are complete he has not yet discovered bow completely to express them  that though ho ffiay well have made up his mind as to what he may with propriety declare he is a little ten in to th thi pei uneasy as to the terms and the effects of his declaration they will know what we mean who have read the brilliant and delightful book it has pleased mr oliphant to christen not  stella and mattie as he might and ought but  altiora peto nothing can be wittier or more amusing than altiora unregenerate  while of altiora regenerate and complete of altiora with a mission and a husband contrived ad hoc the less that is said the better altiora is introduced to the reader as the posthumous child of a certain mr peto by a lady now married to her third husband and as the stepdaughter of one grandesella an italian baron a financier of doubtful antecedents and a reputation not at all above suspicion mr peto as she informs her diary  was a profound but eccentric philosopher with a quaint vein of humour of which indeed i am the victim for his dying request to mamma was that if i was a girl i should be called altiorathus making me the subject of a gentle pun that will stick to me till i die or marry about her father she has she says  a great many odd feelings one of which is that in consequence of his having died ere she was born he has been able to exercise an occult influence over mo from the first moment of my existence which would not have been possible had he remained in though flesh that in fact she is pervaded by his essence and that both morally and intellectually his spiritual nature in somo subtle manner is constantly operative within her this is the reason she thinks why she has  so little sympathy with other girls from these she differs enormously   in the first place life does not seem to present them with any problems  they believe everything they are told take everything as it comes see no contradictions anywhere and do not seem haunted by the standing obligation which has been laid upon me to  seek higher things they groveli dont wish to seem uncharitablebut they really do and are content to me life is a perpetual enigma to which no theological system offers a satisfactory solutionagainst the reefs of which all philosophies break into foam and empty bubbles the girl who can write thus at nineteen and who at ten  could have hopelessly puzzled either the archbishop of canterbury or mr herbert spencer has it must be owned about as little in common with the young women of thackeray as with the young women of mr henry james reflective serious passionate even with a habit of selfsearching and selfanalysis crowned with a name full of mystical promise and suggestiveness and with nothing wanting save experience and a theory of the universe you feel as you read that she is bound for those altitudes of spiritual destiny where none but the author of  piccadilly  or the poet of paul faber can move and live that however by no means prevents her from being to begin with at once delightful and amusing mr oliphant with a touch of satire that is both just and humane has started by making lier as she fancies in love and in love with ronald macalpine the most trumpery malo creature in his collection when we first become acquainted with her she is making up her mind to go nnd meet macalpine on the beach

spinoza in petticoats on her return she confesses to a love scene and to a great deal besides this for instance is how she is moved to think and feel concerning her sweethearts personal appearance   he is tall dark and in his highland dress looks the beauideal of a scottish chief i am afraid even if he had not been so very clever and agreeable as he is i should still have liked him on account of his tout ensemble why this mysterious sentiment which i am now experiencing for the first time should dr pend so much upon the accident of external appearance is another puzzle can it be possible that so deep a passion can really have any connexion with clothes and colour or that i should have felt differently towards him in trousers   and these are the terms in which she records the effects of his declaration  he gently but firmly took my hand and pressed it to his lips of course i should h we liked to let him keep it so i snatched it away and suddenly began to tremble very violently this shows how utterly incapable the will is under certain circumstances to control the organism the hatred and contempt i felt for my own body at that moment was indescribable why should it possess a power of humiliating me at a time when all my feminine instincts which i suppose are my noblest made me wish to disguise my real feelings towards him  on the other hand what was there humiliating in allowing him to perceive that i returned his affection i if i was angry with my body for humiliating me i felt equally angry with my soul or whatever though other part of me is for feeling humiliated i got so absorbed in this physiological dilemma that for a moment j forgot all about him and putting down my paintbrushit was my left hand he had kissed i clasped them both together and gazed vacantly out to sea from this pass of emotional bewilderment she goes on to feeling very happy to enjoying herself as one in a group after a famous millais and in the end to experiencing a sense of mortification in the reflection that my conduct had not been by any means so strikingly original as i should have predicted it would have been whenever an event of so much importance should occur to me her mother a stout round brisk little woman very practical and matter of fact with a ncz retrousse light hair grey eyes and a temper to matchwill not hear of the business altiora of course is deeply wounded but next day macalpine after listening to a statement of his mistresss views in matters spiritual cuts his own throat by observing with a pleased smile that ho and she are both agnostics  ho had no sooner made this remark says altiora  than i felt that all was at an cud between us she refrains it is true from unpocketing her notes for an essay she is writing  on the anomalies of civilised existence as tested by intuitive aspirations in ideal life but she proceeds to argue the point with him though discussion is interrupted by the approach of her stepfather grandesella with an ordsr to pack up an i start for paris that very night and though upshot is that she concludes this first instalment of her diary in such terms as these   so ends the history of my first delusion i wonder whether the experience of my life is t be that it is made up of themwhether tl io satisfaction which most people seem to derive from existence arises from the fact that they live on the surface and dont dig deep enough to find that it is made up of illusions that the financial operations of the baron and mr murkle are haa long become clear to me  that the social ambitions of my mother are is no less evident all the three individuals with whom my life ia moat closely associated are pursuing shadows and they persist in dragging me with them next year i am to be launched upon the society of london and no pains are to be spared to make me a successin other words to make me another illusion  that is what it comes to the only things that seem to me real are poverty sicknesssuffering of all sorts i am strongly inclined to think that if you go deep enough everything else is sham but perhaps that is only because i am young and my experience of life so far has had a tendency to make me morbid there must surely be another side to the medal  and on that hypothesis i solemnly dedicate my life to its discovery all thisand all we have left unquoted is excellent comedy what follows is as good or even better in his next chapter mr oliphant introduces though two most natural and complete of all his world of characters the californian heiress stella walton and her bosom friend mattie terrill they have come to europo to open their minds and as they are both resolved to see things as they are they have chawged names and reputations so that mattie who has a great deal of beauty nnd no money passes for the distinguished heiress stella walton while stella who has heaps of monoy and not much beauty becomes though heiresss poor cousin mattie terrill they are quito fearless and rather impudent they have an abundance of good senso good wit good feeling and good intentions they ave bossed by a wonderful american old maid a certain aunt hannah they aro frank honest spontaneous natural and wholly delightful with the bloodless passionless exquisite young nonentities who 2rovide the modern american novelist with materials for though exerciso of his genius they present a contrast as pleasant and complete as can well bo imagined they become mr oliphanta heroines the moment they enter the story aunt hannah aiding they take possession of altiora they traverse the iniquitous designs of the baron and his partner murkle  they rescuo the hero lord sark from the dutches of the fascinating olymer first of all and afterwards from though ruin he has wrought himself by injudicious proceedings in though city they astonish the elite of society as the duchess of beaucourts guests  they marry altiora to keith hetherington the authors pet heromystic scholar traveller gentlemanone of the vaguest nnd least entertaining personages in good modern fiction  they secure delightful husbands for themselves they write the most amusing letters talk though brightest talk do the most daring things aud bewitch the reader almost as completely in black and white as they might in the flesh thero is nothing for it when they are to the front but to laugh and admire and bo happy they are indeed as human and as irresistible as keith hetherington is unattractive and rorvoto moro than that for them as they who read the story will see it would not be easy to say it is impossible within the limits at our disposal to analyze however briefly though intriguens of balzac touched with george mao donall la m iisi n xueingen liavourcd with robert falconer and though  marquis of lossieof which these charming creatures are the centre or to do more than refer in passing to a few among the crowd of characters in which they are the bright particular stars of altiora herself we have already noted that she falls at once into the background of the story and that moreover she grows less and less interesting as she advances towards that spiritual perfection which her author wills to depict and cannot inseparable from altiora is aunt hannah  rough and racy of speech abounding in good senso and the sweetest humanity  touched with peculiar mysticism gifted with peculiar powers a grotesque for some hundreds of pages of uncommon merit in conception and in execution alike but developing at the last  such is the wickedness of novelists even good ones into an abnormal species of monte

except the grace of chastity all the talents oxcept a talent for honesty all the qualities that make a woman fashionable and none of those that make a woman good alert resolute and unscrupulousone of the boldest and completest sketches in modern fiction then with his  peculiar dark predatory look there is grandesollus partner murkle of whom altiora remarks to her journal that  if ever there was a man whom ono word could describe  murkle is the man and  pounce  is the word there is grandesella himself who says miss peto always made though impression upon me of a turkey gobbler in a perpetual stato of strut  there is lord sark the most engaging and human of recent heroes there is lord sarks friend bob alderney delighted to have but a pound a day and translating the yacna and  vispered and

to say from mr oliphant as a writer of apostolical romance it is possible as wo have shown to differ pretty vigorously with mr oliphant as an artist in dialogue as a social satirist as a painter of men and manners it is impossible to do other than agree there is his j real strength there is his truo success there are dull passages in  altiora peto  j thero are touches ot extravagance traces of j hurry hints of confusion glimpses of failure  to boot but for all that though book is ono  that everybody will greedily read and j greatly admire lt is to begin with though  outcojio cf a mind of siugulur originality  and independence and of such qualities aa wit and humour as good breeding and good temper as knowledge of the world and command of character as elegance of style and clarity and expressiveness of diction it contains enough to equip a score of ordinary novelists for the production of a 6core of extraordinary novels  alt iota peto by laurence oliphant blackwood piccadilly had just enough of sketchy carelessness and improbability to pass for originality and to lead many people into thinking that the author could do much greater things if he liked how far altiora peto has complicated or dispelled this notion it is impossible to say though it is said to have been favourably received we are therefore the more bound to confess at once that we have found it entirely dull and uninteresting both in detail and as a whole the book is an attempt to expand the highclass scientificphilosophicalducal and nethermost west endsociety sketch into a regular novel this is done by now and then wedging in some fragments of a theatrical plot which before it is well developed feebly takes fire and expires in a tedious smouldering fashion the whole thing is of a clumsiness whereat the veteran ouida will haply smile still worse is the sideplot of the young californian belles one rich and plain the other poor and pretty who on their european campaign change names in order to baffle the affections of the men after a tiresome round of forgery and personation and numerous offers of marriage related in detail it merely ends in their undeceiving their lovers and nothing more comes of this confusion which is indeed so perplexing that the author is forced to adopt the borrowed names in speaking of the ladies adding very often such useful reminders as only of course she was really stella or stella all the time being really mattie this kind of business is more effective in farce than fiction both these damsels are supposed to be very remarkable hightoned specimens of the west they merely impress one as dull chatterers there is also a new england aunt hannah a curious caricature after the dickens modelindeed her portrait in the illustrations reminds one strongly of mrs fs aunt she is apparently gifted with prophetic and other supernatural powers which in due time become useful in bundling the plot together the final windingup and liquidation however proves a protracted business being delayed by a not very startling dynamite episode trivial and usually wearisome conversation makes up most of the book much space is also occupied by the ruminations and excursuses of the heroine on faith morals love heredity and herbert spencer much of them we were forced to skip miss peto herself is a good creation but can hardly be said to be even sketched in as it is all we can safely say about her is that she had a mamma who really was not her mamma at all and that instinct always thwarted her earnest efforts to love her however she loves plenty of men but which she finally marries we forget for in order to multiply proposal scenes seven or eight couples are constantly interchanging their lovers there is the usual fashionable bit of financea count fosco baron and much talk of bubble companies and amalgamations most will prefer to read the city article at first hand after searching diligently and anxiously we really cannot find a single thing to praise in this book unless it be the grammar and spelling and the big print and thick paper but all that is a poor compliment of course one feels that mr oliphant is a practised writer and a man of ability and culture and that there is nothing to reprobate or make game of in his work all the same it is as clear as his print that he has no more idea of what a novel should be than a mummy and that he never can and never will write a novel worth yawning over people may say they like it and so critics may think well to pretend to like it and a good many honest souls we dare say really may like it after their fashion because they love to pore over the holy page that tells of duchesses and right honourables aud they have heardprobably trulythat the author has the entree of the most exclusive dens and constantly sees the lions fed any news from the lionhouse is always welcome and if as here it is of a rambling vague and slipshod sort we take it as it comes and for want of a still more inappropriate name call it kindly satire the author is presumably familiar with london society we are in joyful ignorance thereof but not without some stray lights upon poor human nature generally while therefore we allow that his personages have a certain resemblance to the gentlemen and ladies one meets in the best houses in london mandalay and squashville they are dreadfully unlike anybody one is ever likely to meet in or out of doors anywhere under the sun because they are not mortals but parts and fragmentsa limb or two and an idea or so and the rest only talk mr oliphant may know but he cannot describe his london society as we gather it from his hazy fragments is a society which cannot be for it is a house divided against itself thus we are asked to believe in the very superior firstclass virtue of his young ladies yet these virgins and their virtuous mothers are for ever discussing what is to be done for dear lord sark the most eligible parti of the season this ghastly bore is cohabiting with a woman of illfame whom the virgins speak of as  the cly mer not only are they intimate with mrs clymer but they alone or abetted by their mammas hold nauseous conferences with his lordship who sentimentally bemoans himself over the irresistible spells of the syren and in return for his fashionable confidences is very elegantly compassionated and wept over we dont believe it the world is the world all the world over but we strongly suspect that our betters are after all ju3t a little bit better and not a thousand times worse than the rest of us e purcell,ovel

later novels there is the old cunning in the hand that draws the characters but it is guided by a more merciful and therefore a more discerning spirit the worldliness which was the original sin of mrs gores novels is if not wholly eradicated at least much less deeply dyed mrs gore has drawn her characters with more discrimination of shades and she has gone more into the heart of things than she generally has done the first volume is the best and by far the most interesting the scene in prison between the poor old father and his unhappy son is very touching the rise and progress of mark barneson is done well and in a good spirit mrs gore cannot draw manufacturers and their establishments like one who is to the manner bom but she does it well enough for the purposes of a novel the vagueness with which she touches in the incidents and environments of marks life contrast with the sharp definite brilliant delineation of the greshoms and ulleswaters of society rhoda lamberts character is well sketched whilst she is a highspirited ambitious girl but her estrangement from her husband is weakly handled men and women do not act from such compendious motives nor are they except for the convenience of persons writing a story in the habit of going on like machinery in one line of conduct in which every action  has its brother inconsistency is the first law of human nature and as it is the one which novel writers find it the most difficult to administer with truth and probability they leave it uuattempted and take to clockwork after the end of the first volume the story diverges into so many details and so many fresh characters are introduced none of whom are sufficiently discriminated that the reader is confused amidst the crowd and does not feel quite sure that he attaches the right names to the right ownersand when the scattered threads of the story are gathered up and woven into a happy marriage between the lady althea and sir walter wrottesley the happy pair do not stand out so distinctly as the central figures round which the last scene gathers ought to do indeed it would puzzle the most practised novel reader to decide upon the lawful heroine and legitimate hero of the book for none of the characters are of more importance one than the otherthe general interest has been so divided that nobody in the story can claim a place in the memory after once the book is closed the two aristocracies contains nevertheless pleasant reading and though mrs gore might have made it better we are glad of it as it is,ovel

first productions were brilliant successes the channings and east lynne areeven yetimpressedupon our memories as amongst the most entertaining and lifelike of novels the channings especially opened quite a fresh field to storylovers its chief excellence lying in the fact that it forsook the worn tracts of ordinary romance and came nearer home readers fancied that theyllad met the channings out of the pages of the novel in ordinary social intercourse and no book was given with greater confidence into the hands of children by parents than the channings there was a high social tone pervading its pages the characters were not immaculate but real living beings whose alternate shades of darkness and light both in their dispositions and worldly vicissitudes might have found their types in many a pure elevated english household east lynne was not by any means so pure an example but it had very high excellences there was but little that was overstrained the episodes were startling but they were not improbable thecharacters had very decided human weaknesses but they wvere not put forward in an offensive light but rather toned down to meet possible prejudices many objected to certain incidents being incorporated into the story the elopement of the doctors wife through jealousy was not a pleasant subject but the incident is not an uncommon one in ordinary life and it was carefully handled the concluding incidents were the most faulty in the story the return of the first wife in disguise to find another in her place and to be compelled to conceal her identity was rather an awkward conception which although it was got rid of by her speedy death left a most uncomfortable conclusion to the story it had been well for mrs henry woods reputation if she had tried to improve such defects in her style as appearel in her first works  and instead of treating her popularity as a mere commercial speculation to earn money had steadily set herself to study the art of fiction

prudence palfrey until either the story or the journey comes to an abrupt end mr aldrichs sprightly and witty narration would carry his reader with unflagging interest through a far longer novel  prudence palfrey  is a short story and its winding up is so rapid that we can fancy it written as well as intended to be read on a railway journey and that the finale was dashed off as the train whirled screaming into the terminus  prudence palfrey is a pretty orphan heires3 of her guardian old mr dent the old gentleman was attached to prues mother and is now very much inclined to keep prue for himself altogether but mr dent has a penniless young nephew john and john falls in love with prue and she is more than half in love with him john doesnt speak to prudence but he tells his uncle all about it like a frank honest fellow as he is and when the uncle is very angry there are high words between them and john makes up his mind to go golddigging to california before he sets out the young people have one little accidental meeting remembered ali their lives afterwards john is too wise to ask for any promises he goes to put money in his pure and will come back for prue he tells her when he is rich prue says slyly but suppose i have married  old robin gray in the meantime and john replies generously  you are free to do it they part and prue waits heavyhearted till the crown shall become a pound and her john come back to marry her it seems doubtful however whether this will ever occur for john meets with a villainous chum who robs him of all his gains and escapes with the plunder leaving the luckless lover to begin all over again prudence waits three years uncertain whether john is alive or dead meantime old mr dent is laying his plans at home a new clergyman has been introduced chiefly by his influence into the old brick church the rev mr dillingham is young rich highlyeducated and of a serious disposition all the young ladies of his congregation set their caps at him he is charmed with the society of mr dent and his ward  though his manner to prue is never that of a lover and prue is a little nettled to find that she has so little power over the interesting and popular young clergyman therefore when one day mr dillingham suddenly proposes to prudence she cannot help feeling surprised and pleased and asks for a short respite to consider her answer the time allotted passes away and still prue wavers mr dillingham himself turns the balance how could he be so foolish as to select from all j the music on the piano that one little scotch song for prue to sing to him it is auld robin grey  and prudence sings with a strange passion breaks down and hurries away to her own room she can sing no more to mr dillingham that last meeting with john under the trees by the garden seat has she ever forgotten it  the old old love has come backfor ever up to this time the story has run on smoothly enough but now on a sudden john comes back a ragged wraith with a broken arm and discovers that the portrait of mr dillingham is the portrait of his villainous chum who ran off with the money bags and has since attempted to shoot john through the head on the same day mr dillingham absconds leaving a bleating and shepherdless flock and several damsels in despair and now discoveries are unearthed like potatoes mr dillingham preached from known authors mr dillingham had a habit of carrying off valuables from his friends houses  and lastly mr dillingham had proposed to and been accepted by a young lady a friend of prues if old mr dent is chagrined at his want of discrimination as regards the character of the enigmatical young clergyman he cannot feel more acutely ashamed of himself than does the reader of the story who has been completely gulled by mr aldrich to the very last moment the fault which most strikes us in the plot of mr aldrichs story is that he does not sufficiently explain though motives of the clerical scamp we are left to wonder what feelings on mr dillinghams part could have prompted him to come a wolf in sheeps clothing into the heart of johns family and why he sent an emissary to track and murder john if he meant to marry prudence and so possess himself of old mr dents money we could understand it but if this was his motive why does mr aldrich engage him subsidiarily to the other young lady who must eventually in any case have published his conduct and ruined his prospects  if mr aldrich intends the clerical gentleman to be a riddle without an answer he succeeds indubitably the story would have been a pretty and complete one and perhaps more artistic if mr dillingham had not been a villain but simply prues other suitorher  old robin gray but it would certainly not have been so excitingnot such a railway novel in fact there is one other character in the story which we must mention before we conclude it is parson wibird hawkins the old man who was shelved to make room for mr dillingham  who had been pastor of the parish for fifty years and of whom the parish was tired  whose dearest wish was that when the spirit of the lord came to take him it might find him in the pulpit of the old brick church who died very quietly on the evening of his abdication sitting in his study with his bible on his knees a brokenhearted man mr aldrich possesses a keen sense of the pathetic as well as of the humorous there are scraps of description in his storysuch as the old parsonage garden with its marigoldbeds and its little green bench under the vines and again the ruined fort on the hilltop with the varied landscape unrolling itself  like a coloured map beneathwhich though brief are rich and indelible we feel sure that  prudence palfrey  will be widely and deservedly popular m f,ovel

told his tale quietly and steadily the subject is unhackneyed and there are skill and originality in  building up the incidents and drawing the i characters but the author loses time and space by indulging in declamatory bits of elo quence and in the desire to be dramatic he  has weakened the effect of a story sufficiently remarkable to need no adventitious aid of rhetoric the outline of the tale is briefly as follows a son long estranged from home by a quarrel with his father has married made his own way in the world and been for some time successful as a literary man and editor of a journal he is however at the opening of the story on the verge of bankruptcy the first scenes are merely introductory to show the character of the man and the nature of the charming good wisehearted wife whom he is so fortunate as to possess screening her brother who having been his confidential clerk had embezzled a large sum of money has been the real cause of colemans embarrassments and nearly of his disgrace coleman will not disclose the secret of a man whom he has pardoned and who is repenting his crime but his wife proves the facts and his good name is cleared the wilful character of the man in adhering to a course of action he has once adopted is well illustrated in these preliminary scenes but they are too long and too minutely drawn out they detain the reader from the main interest of the tale after the affairs of the bankruptcy are wound up coleman his wife and child go into somersetshire to stay with his mother now a widow and sole mistress of the paternal acres her character

dogged tenacity of purpose she and her son have never been estranged all these years they have been in regular correspondence and on his fathers death she would have had him home only that he was then following his own career in london she receives him and his wife with a hearty welcome whilst little johnny their son is the delight of her heart the return to the old home and the description of the life there led are well done the character of coleman is well developed with his quaint genial humour his tenderness for his wife and the gnarled perverse knot of obstinacy in his nature with which only his wife can deal domesticated in the family they find the farm bailiff a rude florid coarse goodlooking man who had become manager of the farm on the death of the husband when coleman could not or would not return to take his own place as head of the family in the years that have elapsed the bailiff has secured his influence and coleman discovers that his mother is on the brink of marrying him fondly hoping that they may still continue to live together as a happy family all this story is well and skilfully told the scene between mother and son is extremely good and the character of the old woman is very true to human nature when her son reproaches her with disrespect to his fathers memory lowe your father nothingshe said your father did me a mean turn which i have not forgotten and shant forget to my dying day your aunt dora could tell you all about it its no matter no matter but you have minded me of a good reason for what i mean to do for gods sake what has my father done mother which could influence you to sacrifice yourself i always believed that you and my father lived happily eh dear happily that is the happiness i never talk of injustice or wrongs but i dont think of em the less not much happened since then in this quiet house to put em out of my mind then to the quiet astonishment of her son who scarcely trusted his ears she gave him the history with feminine bitterness and detail of a certain velvet mantle which her husband had long promised her and made a deal of fuss about when it arrived she could have put a piedish under cither shoulder it was such an illfit and she wished to have it sent back and altered what do you think he did will he tumbled the mantle into its box and sent it off as a present to your aunt dora the woman of all the world i hate the most and he told me to my face a few days after that he had heard from her to say it was a good fit for her i have done him many a kind turn since that will and i sat up for six nights with him when he wab dying without ever taking off my clothes but i tellee i was thinking of that drees when i looked from my window and saw the velvet on his hearse with all this implacability there is a simple straightforwardness in the old lady which wins the readers sympathy shemarries the bailiff with a guileless trust that is almost heroic of course though natural result followshe has married her for her money and proves a coarse tyrant her son and his wife stay beside her to shield and comfort her and to be ready to take her away when she is willing to go but the catastrophe comes quickly personally illused her husband drawing all her hardlysaved money and squandering it in riotous living bringing his mistress into the house the wretched old woman is maddened with indignation one night coming home drunk after a lengthened absence he insults her beyond her power to endure he reels upstairs to bed and she fetches a hatchet and murders him in his sleep her son hearing a noise goes to her room and finds her standing with the hatchet in her hand the necessity for action the instinct to saare his mother at whatever cost prompt him to take measures which have the effect of involving him in a aveb of suspicious and incriminating circumstances his avife who alone could have given the information which avould have cleared him is kept by him out of the way at the coroners inquest the result is that he is committed for trial along with the old lady as guilty of the murder he then deliberately resolves to sacrifice himself his wife and child and to save his mother a wife cannot give evidence in a criminal case either for or against her husband eleanors despair her efforts her baffled endeavours to make the truth heard are well described but in the last volume the style is throughout declamatory and rhetorical which aveakens the effect the quietest and most steady avriting was needed to make the working out of colemans fanaticism probable or pleasant he prefers his mother to his avise and child and having decided to save her it needed great delicacy and good management on the part of the author to carry the sympathy of the reader with him but he wastes all his strength to illustrate the hardship of the law that prevents a wife bearing testimony for her husband and to this purpose the symmetry and strength of the novel is sacrificed coleman trifles with his avife deceives her keeps her at arms length and behaves to her in a manner entirely unworthy of her faithfulness and courage the whole of the last volume is hurried there is a want of good workmanship which is the more provoking as the author has shown himself quite capable of the mechanism of his craft all that passes after the trial is weak and confused a condemned murderer is not allowed to leave his cell and go out into the avorld on a mere  reprieve the statement of the old lady given under the influence of an overdose of laudanum would have required corroboration and her confession is so hazy that it reads more like the murmuring of delirium than a definite statement the scene between eleanor and her husband in prison when she brings him the good news is feeble and unsatisfactory the author appears to have become weary of his task or else to have considered it unnecessary to finish up his work in a businesslike manner he gives all his care and attention to the sensation scenes instead of considering his work as a whole the character of michael the irish retainer is clever and his mode of dealing with the witnesses is amusingly characteristic but there is too much of him and he is too stagey to touch the sympathy of the reader the author of the wifes evidence is capable of writing a powerful wellsustained novel and we hope he will give us one that will do justice to his talent,ovel

and as an artist we have no concern with mr bennetts artistic conscience he knows what he is about better than most men in all he does that quality of assurance is manifest and he does nothing that is not good ot its kind his melodramas fantasias he is clever enough to call themcould not fail to satisfy the abandoned craving for sensation  his criticism should be better known than it is his essay on george moore in  fame and fiction  expresses one point of view with singular precision and some beauty his  a great man  has wit but his best up till now is undoubtedly to be found in  anna of the five towns  in  leonora and in his latest book which is now before us we feel that these are his work the others are simply turned off for amusement in leisure moments safetyvalves for his superfluous steam in  sacred and profane love  mr bennett has set himself a great task he narrates the three experiences of passion that have come into the life of a strong and beautiful womana character which any imaginative writer might well be proud to have created her name name is carlotta and she tells her own story the personal method of narration is in this case a necessity and is not thc least of the many difficulties that have beset mr bennetts path and over which he has triumphed by the power of his technique the chief difficulty however is to make the theme noble the least wavering or uncertainty of grip in the author and the theme of passion infallibly and swiftly becomes ignoble and sordid here again mr bennett has succeeded  he has created feeling that is intense enough and sincere enough to need no apology  but here also in our opinion lies the weak point of the book he has not sufficiently trusted to bis power to ennoble the theme on its own merits he has made use of artifice which was not necessary for him he has no need to make the lover diaz a worldfamed pianist by so doing he weakens the essential by introducing an element of improbability into the opening phase of the book and again at the end the emotional intensity is lowered and not heightened to climax by the superficial pomp of diazs triumph in the paris operahouse a weaker writer would have had need for all the glitterand tinsel which he could command mrbennett has not tinsel merely serves to obscure the large humanity of his treatment conspicuous when carlotta steals down into the hall of the hotel in the early morning and bus the boatshaped straw hat from the servant girl and comes in contact with the people starting for their work on her journey home conspicuous too throughout the second part and especially in the scenesplendidly dramaticbetween carlotta and mrs ispanlove a weak whimpering woman who rouses all the pity in the strong heart of carlotta conspicuous in the character of the very old man lord alcar these are touches of genius  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett chatto  windus there is not very much sacred love in mr bennetts novel which is obviously inspired by a study of modern frenoh fiction the story is told in the first person by miss carlotta peel whose career is one must hope unusual in the first chapters we find her a victim to the celebrated pianist diaz on the first occasion of their meeting later she becomes the mistress of a publisher who issues her books for she is a popular writerindeed we gather a famous writer since when she again encounters diar he knows of her repute the publisher on hearing that his wife has committed suicide blows out his brains but carlotta undismayed continues her career of sacred or profane love  whichever mr bennett calls it diaz has unhappily become a dipsomaniac but she heroically redeems him from his degrading vice and writes the libretto of an opera which startles paris and then she dies what mr bennett means if he means anything it is hard to discover his tale reads like a parody of a french novel and at times is positively grotesque certainly if it has been his object to depict the amours of an illregulated woman he has failed to realise her for us carlotta is only such a woman as seen from the outside by mr bennett and as composed by him from imagination she never convinces us and though the ways of women are well known to be inscrutable they are not so unnecessarily wanton as hers this is how she explains herself to the publisher but it does not seem to advance us much  for me there are two beingsmyself and the observer of myself it is the novelists disease this duplication of personality when i said illusion i meant the supreme illusion of love is

her ihe lets her tell her own tale leaves her to the charity of his readers she justifies her own existence and the manner of it mr arnold bennetts technique is such that the rather melodramatic plot

the power she exercises over all with whom she comes in contact is suggested with such intellectual appreciation of the moods of her genius that not only does she become one of mrs wards most attractive characters but also one of the most convincing we meet her early in the book the story revolves around her and we part from her in the end regretfully she has been scorched and purified by the fire of experience and of the two men who loved her one things being as they were was not unhappy in dying the other we leave happy in his life through her julie is very human not in the least a

similar temptation she too runs to meet it and is only saved by chance and the devotion of another of her adorers that man was delafield a dreamer mystic and individualist who eventually succeeds to a dukedom this is how julie appeared to him  he meanwhile as he advanced further in the knowledge of her strange nature was more and more bewildered by heelier perversities and caprices her brilliances and powers her utter lack of any standard or scheme of life she had been for a long time as it seemed to him the creature of her exquisite social instinctsthen the creature of passion hut what a woman

your face asking to be ledto be wrestled and reasoned with it is a crowded canvas where julie le breton warkworth the ambitious selfseeking soldier and delafield move in the foreground at first one is inclined to resent the number of titled and distinguished people there is a duke a duchess a cabinet minister an ambassador a distinguished editor and a host of other more or less eminent controllers of affairs to say nothing of lady henry delafield the grande dame old peevish halfblind who has engaged julie as companion and who realises that it is the amazing charm of this companion that gathers the select crowd to her house we certainly feel the fascination of julie le breton her extraordinary adaptability to circumstances her power of growth the diplomacy of her sympathy  in talking with her dead avails seemed to give way vistas of hope and possibility opened in the very heart of discouragement she found the right word the right jest the right spur to invention or effort in the latter part of the book we escape from the atmosphere of great houses crushes and footmen and the spiritual drama of the action of individual lives one upon the other is worked out by mrs ward with an intellectual sympathy and a knowledge of the complexities of the human soul that has not been surpassed in any of her former books love is not here the sentimental emotion of the ordinary novel or play but the power that purges the weaknesses and vivifies the dormant nobilities of men and women warkworth for all his faults had the courage of his impulses and few will read that last letter of his or the sudden news of his death without emotion to julie is left an abiding sorrow and the humanising of delafield  his destiny is to tame and console her here is a picture of delafield the

nere is not ana never was tnat of english society but remains fundamentally french it is the world of the salon an institution which as mrs ward herself confesses has never properly taken root on english soil just as by a quotation from one of mlle de lespinasses letters at a critical point of the story she acknowledges the foreign derivation of her principal character julie le breton is julie de lespinasse the natural daughter of a great lady the comtesse dalbon or lady rose delaney left almost penniless after her mothers death she enters society under a bond of silence as the companion of another great lady madame du deffand or lady henry delafield by sheer force of character and social gift she becomes the centre of all that is brilliant and distinguished in the capital eclipsing her indignant patroness and ends by bringing upon her head explosion and dismissal the question is which way will society go  which will prevail the charm of an engaging but ambiguous personality or the old habits of family connexion rank and respectability  this in any case would be an interesting situation  in the original owing to the greatness of the characters concerned turgot and dalembert the former is represented by montresor in the copy it is a great situation we have to ask what is the effect of it as reproduced in mrs humphry wards book the answer is not doubtful on the one hand mrs wards fiction gains immensely by it on the other the reality itself almost equally suffers after a series of works whose interest was in truth somewhat factitious and topical turning upon a religious political or social question of the day it is a sheer artistic advantage to mrs ward to light upon a subject of wide generality affording scope for a disinterested study of human character and passion to find ready to hand to rest firmly upon a set of facts easily and naturally complicated brimming with fullness and life the reality communicates so much of its own virtue and power to mrs wards book as undoubtedly to raise it in comparison with her own previous effortsat any rate the more recent onesto a very high rank but as compared with the reality itself mrs wards success is far from complete and complete success to say no more was here imperative it is essential to one limb of the situation that we should feel julie le breton to be a creature of extraordinary charm but of this charm in spite of many protestations mrs ward fails to convince us her character is equivocal throughout she is certainly clever  she is perhaps beautiful this is never made quite clear but she intrigues she tells lies she permits herself to love her girlish cousins fiance in a word she is not too straight besides she has fits of morbid emotion and is nearly always under the shadow of physical exhaustion even with these disadvantages a character may possibly be invested with charm but mrs ward has not discovered the secret no julie de lespinasse was not like that nor does the character of jacob delafield satisfy us either he is beyond our depth or he is really confused and unreal lady henry is much better but it is with the minor characters8ir wilfrid bury lord lockington the duke and duchess of crowborough the latter especiallythat mrs ward succeeds the best and they are not so vital to the main situation mrs ward has a saving sense of humour and no more we wish it were a little more positive we wish that these dukes and duchesses lords and ladies ministers and diplomatists were just a shade less reverently treated one more remark mrs ward does not know how to finish a book neatly  and in  lady roses daughter the end is too much taken up with physical ailments a subject which is often harrowing without being truly and poetically affecting  sai notes on novels by these

B1890,['8691054'],  poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of

miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,ovel

words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who

enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets

make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her

hinted that he nurses a secret sorrow after a years stay in suffolk barbara and the two other principal characters of the tale are separatedaunt shandyshaft sending the child home to her harsh father and hugh farquharthe superb the sumptuous mysterious hughtaking his secret sorrow and flashing eyes to foreign landa after a while barbara is sent to a german college where she distinguishes herself as an artist from this point of the book almost to the end of the story mr dickenss influence ceases to make itself felt and the author works away under inspiration drawn from charlotte brontes novels the life of the german college is the college life of villettewith a difference  barbara no longer a feminine edition of david copperfield becomes a refined spiritualized jane eyre  and hugh farquhar who unexpectedly makes his appearance at the college plays the part of mr rochesteralso with a difference the girl and the man fall fiercely in love with each other but instead of throwing himself at her feet and asking for her hand he strives against a love in the gratification of which lies his only chance of happiness the secret sorrow already hinted at the black mysterious trouble of his days forbids him to make the girl his wife at length the offer is made and he is accepted  but even after matters have reached that point hugh farquhar flies from barbara not daring to marry her in defiance of principle of course the reader assumes that like mr rochester hugh farquhar is already married unable to live away from weird little barbara the tempestuous lover returns and they are married a period of continental travel succeeds the ceremony and after a while hugh reluctantly consents to return to england and settle with his young wife at broomhill as soon as she has entered the old mansion barbara begins to suspect that it contains secret apartments from which she is excluded and a mysterious occupant of those apartments whose acquaintance she is not permitted to make time and accident convert suspicion into knowledge barbara ascertains that a lovely woman is kept in the house of which she herself is mistressa woman of whom her husband has never made mention this is the most exciting part of the story first the reader suspects that hugh like mr rochester has a mad wife shut up in his house then that the mysterious lady is a mistress whom he dares to cherish under the same roof with his wife barbara and hugh at length come to an understanding about the mysterious ladythe husband telling his wife a rigmarole little calculated to impose on so j clever a woman and barbaraclever woman and jealous wife though she isaccepting the flimsy statement but the fire is only deadened i not quenched ere long barbara passing along a gallery overhears her husband in private conversation withins beautiful lodger they are sitting together like lovers the lovely italian woman is passionately reminding hugu of her devotion to him and declaring that barbara will never love him as she maddalena has loved and still loves him pleasant talk this for poor barbara a minute later she hears hugh address the woman as  poa mia barbara stays to listen no longer that same night she flies from broomhill and after sickness and peril makes her way to rome eventually a reconciliation is effected between barbara and her husband  and in order that the heroine may not be censured for pardoning the man who appears to have put upon her the worst affront husband can offer to wife miss edwards covers her hero with so thick and complete a coating of whitewash that there ia not enough darkness left to account for what has taken place in the story it is shown that hugh never married maddalenathe reader thereby learning that his indignation against mr farquhar as a bigamist has been murplaced and that in addition to the pleasurable excitement of reading a good bigamy case he has also the pleasure of discovering that the supposed criminal is innocent the whitewashing goes on it is shown that hugh cannot be said even to have seduced maddalenaaye more that he cannot be said even to have loved her true he was his mistress many years before his marriage  but he was drawn into the affair by pity not love for the woman who threw herself at his feet vowing that she idolised him the process of whitewashing is not yet done it is shown that hugh would have married her if he could have done so  but as her existing marriage with an aged and repulsive husband prevented him from taking that step he promised her never to marry any other woman it is proved also that hugh had long since ceased to give maddalena any special signs of personal favour  and therefore that though he was guilty of indiscretion in harbouring her in though same house with his wife he had in no way been false to his marriage vows it does not seem to strike miss edwards that the statements of this whitewashing part are not only inconsistent with her characters but break down the entire framework of her story it is not very probable that a fastidious refined and highly sensitive mana man without any alloy of physical or moral weaknesswould live with any woman under the circumstances described from motives of commiseration  sensitive men do not love women who throw themselves at their feet and play the part of whipped spaniels licking thc dust off their masters shoes it is simply incredible that a keen flippant sarcastic sceptic like hugh could have bound himself to such a worshipper by an unsought promise never to marry another woman  and even if in a moment of weakness he had given such a promise he most ussuredly would not have regarded it as a valid obligation years after relinquishing personal intercourse with the dishonoured beauty again if that had been the true story of his intimacy with maddalena what reason was there for keeping the matter from barbaras knowledge after he bad married her in fact the apology does too much bringing down the entire structure of the tale with a crash let us however say that we like missedwards all the better for her error con senting to humour the existing taste for bigamy stories she was determined not to make too great a sacrifice of womanly dignity for a consideration she would touch pitch  but pitch white and perfumedpitch which ehe might lay aside with clean hands just as mrs ratcliffe used to season her stories with the requisite amount of ghostly horrors capable of explanation in the last chapter so has miss edwards effected a compromise between her own sense of right and the depraved appetite of the public giving zest to her romance by the introduction of a bigamist who as the curtain falls is proved to be a man of exemplary character what her story loses by this compromise the personal character of the lady gains whether it will not be best for her both as a woman and an artist to have no further transactions with white pitch is a question which she will do well to put to herself,ovel
B2019,['3162358'],  the manxman mr hall caines new novel like the greater part of his work indeed has one special and noticeable quality it forces you to feel how straight out of his heart he writes a few other writers of fiction today may have equal emotional intensity but they are either careful to hide it or unable to express it he backs up this warmth of feeling by much else it is trueby humour by observation by excellent workmanship the manxman is a very full book fuller even than the deemster and  the bondman appealing to varied interests expending a lavish amount of material and showing no thinness or flimsiness anywhere still its special power over readers is emotional a power great and dangerous his keen appreciation of humour may generally be trusted to keep this other and stronger quality within bounds but one lights on a spot now and again where the atmosphere is sickly because the wholesome airs of humour have ceased for the moment to blow the novel is a tribute to his beloved island warmer even than  the deemster to the character of its people  the manxman by hall caine 6s heinemann to the picturesqueness of their simple lives it is in a sense a book of manx folklore and the descriptions of old rites and customs are the occasions of some of the most striking passages though one must admit that the artist has been driven too much by the patriot there is

trust reposed in them pete comes home a rich man but not so rich in gold as in love for kate and his friend worldly prospects and the story of his own unequally mated father and mother keep philip from preventing the marriage but the woman unable long to bear her false position leaves her husband and is hid by ner old lover mr caine has attempted a great task in following the inner life of philip a man of sensitive soul of great talents and distinguished by fortune feeling himself every day more corrupted and degraded by a secret sin that brings him no gratification high or low the hunting of philip by his fortune and his conscience raises the book to a high tragic level kate in a sudden burst of unselfishness goes away but misfortune follows her and on her return she has to appear before philip the deemster on a charge of attempting her own life and is committed to gaol divorce proceedings with closed doors sever her from pete dis tinctions are showered on philip and his secret is safe but at the great ceremony of his appointment as governor he refuses the honour makes public confession goes to the prison and leads kate out a comparison here is inevitable the scene challenges comparison as voluntarily as do the turners hung side by side with the claudes in the national gallery if it is not longer than the one our mind reverts to it is too long and too unrestrained it does not thrill like  at last at last i stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have

unconsciously poetical and of a trustfulness in a shaky world heartbreaking to behold when he knows not where kate has gone he invents sublime falsehoods to account for her disappearance and you never heard tell of him not uncle joey with the bald head well well  a smart old man though man alive the lively he is too and the laughable and the good company to look at that mans face youd say the sun

and as an artist we have no concern with mr bennetts artistic conscience he knows what he is about better than most men in all he does that quality of assurance is manifest and he does nothing that is not good ot its kind his melodramas fantasias he is clever enough to call themcould not fail to satisfy the abandoned craving for sensation  his criticism should be better known than it is his essay on george moore in  fame and fiction  expresses one point of view with singular precision and some beauty his  a great man  has wit but his best up till now is undoubtedly to be found in  anna of the five towns  in  leonora and in his latest book which is now before us we feel that these are his work the others are simply turned off for amusement in leisure moments safetyvalves for his superfluous steam in  sacred and profane love  mr bennett has set himself a great task he narrates the three experiences of passion that have come into the life of a strong and beautiful womana character which any imaginative writer might well be proud to have created her name name is carlotta and she tells her own story the personal method of narration is in this case a necessity and is not thc least of the many difficulties that have beset mr bennetts path and over which he has triumphed by the power of his technique the chief difficulty however is to make the theme noble the least wavering or uncertainty of grip in the author and the theme of passion infallibly and swiftly becomes ignoble and sordid here again mr bennett has succeeded  he has created feeling that is intense enough and sincere enough to need no apology  but here also in our opinion lies the weak point of the book he has not sufficiently trusted to bis power to ennoble the theme on its own merits he has made use of artifice which was not necessary for him he has no need to make the lover diaz a worldfamed pianist by so doing he weakens the essential by introducing an element of improbability into the opening phase of the book and again at the end the emotional intensity is lowered and not heightened to climax by the superficial pomp of diazs triumph in the paris operahouse a weaker writer would have had need for all the glitterand tinsel which he could command mrbennett has not tinsel merely serves to obscure the large humanity of his treatment conspicuous when carlotta steals down into the hall of the hotel in the early morning and bus the boatshaped straw hat from the servant girl and comes in contact with the people starting for their work on her journey home conspicuous too throughout the second part and especially in the scenesplendidly dramaticbetween carlotta and mrs ispanlove a weak whimpering woman who rouses all the pity in the strong heart of carlotta conspicuous in the character of the very old man lord alcar these are touches of genius  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett chatto  windus there is not very much sacred love in mr bennetts novel which is obviously inspired by a study of modern frenoh fiction the story is told in the first person by miss carlotta peel whose career is one must hope unusual in the first chapters we find her a victim to the celebrated pianist diaz on the first occasion of their meeting later she becomes the mistress of a publisher who issues her books for she is a popular writerindeed we gather a famous writer since when she again encounters diar he knows of her repute the publisher on hearing that his wife has committed suicide blows out his brains but carlotta undismayed continues her career of sacred or profane love  whichever mr bennett calls it diaz has unhappily become a dipsomaniac but she heroically redeems him from his degrading vice and writes the libretto of an opera which startles paris and then she dies what mr bennett means if he means anything it is hard to discover his tale reads like a parody of a french novel and at times is positively grotesque certainly if it has been his object to depict the amours of an illregulated woman he has failed to realise her for us carlotta is only such a woman as seen from the outside by mr bennett and as composed by him from imagination she never convinces us and though the ways of women are well known to be inscrutable they are not so unnecessarily wanton as hers this is how she explains herself to the publisher but it does not seem to advance us much  for me there are two beingsmyself and the observer of myself it is the novelists disease this duplication of personality when i said illusion i meant the supreme illusion of love is it not an illusionwill it last who knows by that time carlotta ought to have had a shrewd suspicion it would not  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett i chatto and windus in one wvay  sacred and

her ihe lets her tell her own tale leaves her to the charity of his readers she justifies her own existence and the manner of it mr arnold bennetts technique is such that the rather melodramatic plot

indulging in declamatory bits of elo quence and in the desire to be dramatic he  has weakened the effect of a story sufficiently remarkable to need no adventitious aid of rhetoric the outline of the tale is briefly as follows a son long estranged from home by a quarrel with his father has married made his own way in the world and been for some time successful as a literary man and editor of a journal he is however at the opening of the story on the verge of bankruptcy the first scenes are merely introductory to show the character of the man and the nature of the charming good wisehearted wife whom he is so fortunate as to possess screening her brother who having been his confidential clerk had embezzled a large sum of money has been the real cause of colemans embarrassments and nearly of his disgrace coleman will not disclose the secret of a man whom he has pardoned and who is repenting his crime but his wife proves the facts and his good name is cleared the wilful character of the man in adhering to a course of action he has once adopted is well illustrated in these preliminary scenes but they are too long and too minutely drawn out they detain the reader from the main interest

following his own career in london she receives him and his wife with a hearty welcome whilst little johnny their son is the delight of her heart the return to the old home and the description of the life there led are well done the character of coleman is well developed with his quaint genial humour his tenderness for his wife and the gnarled perverse knot of obstinacy in his nature with which only his wife can deal domesticated in the family they find the farm bailiff a rude florid coarse goodlooking man who had become manager of the farm on the death of the husband when coleman could not or would not return to take his own place as head of the family in the years that have elapsed the bailiff has secured his influence and coleman discovers that his mother is on the brink of marrying him fondly hoping that they may still continue to live together as a happy family all this story is well and skilfully told the scene between mother and son is extremely good and the character of the

coming home drunk after a lengthened absence he insults her beyond her power to endure he reels upstairs to bed and she fetches a hatchet and murders him in his sleep her son hearing a noise goes to her room and finds her standing with the hatchet in her hand the necessity for action the instinct to saare his mother at whatever cost prompt him to take measures which have the effect of involving him in a aveb of suspicious and incriminating circumstances his avife who alone could have given the information which avould have cleared him is kept by him out of the way at the coroners inquest the result is that he is committed for trial along with the old lady as guilty of the murder he then deliberately resolves to sacrifice himself his wife and child and to save his mother a wife cannot give evidence in a criminal case either for or against her husband eleanors despair her efforts her baffled endeavours to make the truth heard are well described but in the last volume the style is throughout declamatory and rhetorical which aveakens the effect the quietest and most steady avriting was needed to make the working out of colemans fanaticism probable or pleasant he prefers his mother to his avise and child and having decided to save her it needed great delicacy and good management on the part of the author to carry the sympathy of the reader with him but he wastes all his strength to illustrate the hardship of the law that prevents a wife bearing testimony for her husband and to this purpose the symmetry and strength of the novel is sacrificed coleman trifles with his avife deceives her keeps her at arms length and behaves to her in a manner entirely unworthy of her faithfulness and courage the whole of the last volume is hurried there is a want of good workmanship which is the more provoking as the author has shown himself quite capable of the mechanism of his craft all that passes after the trial is weak and confused a condemned murderer is not allowed to leave his cell and go out into the avorld on a mere  reprieve the statement of the old lady given under the influence of an overdose of laudanum would have required corroboration and her confession is so hazy that it reads more like the murmuring of delirium than a definite statement the scene between eleanor and her husband in prison when she brings him the good news is feeble and unsatisfactory the author appears to have become weary of his task or else to have considered it unnecessary to finish up his work in a businesslike manner he gives all his care and attention to the sensation scenes instead of considering his work as a whole the character of michael the irish retainer is clever and his mode of dealing with the witnesses is amusingly characteristic but there is too much of him and he is too stagey to touch the sympathy of the reader the author of the wifes evidence is capable of writing a powerful wellsustained novel and we hope he will give us one that will do justice to his talent,ovel

B9004,['9433186'],  1 kissing the rod a novel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth novel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the

he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends

impression that we have seen the authors name on a titlepage in former times we should not hesitate to speak of the story as a first attempt in a department of art for which the writer has not a single qualification and just so much education that he can string together english words with a lair degree of grammatical correctness and an appearance of facility out of tender heed for the sensitiveness of youth we will however disregard this vague impression and giving mr monkhouse the benefit of the doubt will deal tenderly with him as a youngster who after the wont of in experience

regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and

the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian

was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old

verners pride and nowhere else the medical evidence at thc inquest proves a cause for rachel wishing to hide her shame per haps by suicide  but the cries that were heard i make it evident that she had been got rid of  by violent means probably by some one to  whom her presence would prove hereafter a i reproach the  tall man seen by the boy  in the lane pointed a finger of suspicion ut one  of though three young men resident at vernors pride but it can be fixed on no one in par ticular they all strenuously deny it and are  eager to discover the perpetrator a former rejected lover of rachels called luke ray j the son of though bailiff is the only known r admirer she had but he had left for london  some days before the murder preparatory to emigrating to australia with john massiug bird who was to follow him in a few days at  the inquest robin frost rachels brother  registers a dark vow to leave no stone un  turned by night or day till he shall have found i the murderer aud revenged his sisters blood  two years elapse and we find stephen verner and his nephew lionel much estranged without any known cause lionels character is very fine a youth handsome brave and chivalrous with a keen sense of honourfrank and open as the dayto know him was to love him and his uncles apparent dislike and distrust of him is inexplicable lady verner with her daughter deciina and her wad lucy tempest lives at denham courther second son janus vernernever tailed anything but jan having joined dr west the village medico as assistant his character is painted with much cleverness though wanting in the personal charms of his brother and sister his straightforward honest simplicity makes him a favourite with all except his mother whose weak mind can never forgive his want of refinement and disregard of all the bienseances of society lady verner at last renounces the hope of ever modelling him into a lord chesterfield or a sir charles grandison her model of what a gentleman should be we next are introduced to dr wests family sybilla wests ruling passions are vanity and ambition and though she likes fred massingbird she thinks it worldlywise to keep the heir of verners pride her slave as well at this time news comes of john massingbird having been killed on his way down from the diggings and frederick determines to lose no time in going out to australia to claim possession of the various nuggets of which john had written home such glowing accounts he determines not to leave sybilla to his rival so proposes that she should marry him dr west gives his consent so gladly to this marriage that sybilla feels disturbed  but on bis whispering a few mysterious words in her ear she colours violently and assents and now they marry and start on their voyage leaving lionel sore in heart and disappointed for he has loved this girl with all the intensity of his strong and tender nature and has nothing now to uphold him but the pride which belongs to all verners and he bravely buries this sorrow in the depths of his heart so that no outward eye could detect the fire that is consuming his hearts core mr verner now falls ill and before dying tells his executor that he has left all his property to fred massingbird and in reversion to lionel hinting darkly that lionel had forfeited it after much persuasion he adds a codicil revoking the will and making lionel the heir to all his wealth and giving him various directions about the estate this codicil is carefully locked up in the desk kept in the sick mans room in the presence of lionel the doctor and the lawyer when the time comes to open the will after the funeral the codicil is nowhere to be found and after many fruitless searches lionel leaves the home he has so long looked on as his own and takes up his abode at denham court with his mother mrs wood is not much of a lawyer and the reader who knows anything about wills and property can only smile at her very romantic machinery his future life blightedhis prospects his love all gone the strength and sweetness of lionels character now shine forth is lucy tempest insensible to his charms she is a girl whose influence sanctifies every home  pure simple and natural singleminded and true in all she says or does of rare beauty and so unselfish that all who read the story of her struggles must feel the better for her bright example lionel turns to her in his misery and finds so much sympathy that to her alone he pours out all his woes lucy would not havebeen human had she not become deeply attached to him it is but one short step from comforter to lover but few could sink their own future and wreck their happiness in complete forgetfulness of self as she does lionel begins to feel how necessary this fair young creature is to him and on more than one occasion betrays his feelings to her and leads her to hope that she may one day fill sybillas place death now becomes busy with the owners of verners pride fred massingbird dies of fever three weeks after landing in australia and mrs vemer falls a victim to apoplexy so lionel returns to his old inheritance to the great joy of every one he has not been in possession many months when a carriage draws up one night containing no less a personage than mrs frederick massingbird and  a lovely vision glided in clothed in deep mourning with a shower of golden curls shading her damask cheek lionels heart we are informed  leapt as if it would burst its bounds and well it might for she arrives fancying mrs verner still alive and intending to live with her the knowledge of her death makes no difference to her and she persists in asking lionel to give her a home she will not see the impropriety of it she declines going to her fathers house and her beauty and her helplessness and her misery completely disarm him what follows may be guessed sybilla is enchanting as ever and lionel in an unguarded moment swears to love and protect her and make her his wife this we cannot but think weak and unnatural we can forgive lionel for having had his head turned once by so pretty a face but having seen somewhat of her true nature and having since had a vision of such true womanhood as lucy tempest we can feel little pity on his thrusting his head again into such a noose and now a storm bursts lady verners and decimas misery and disapproval his own consciousness about lucy and the extravagance and heartlessness of his new wife would have tried the patience of a saint but not of lionel verner whose forbearance is most exemplary and we trust will teach a lesson to many a sorelytried husband who may read this book we think verners pride may be popular it has many merits and some faults it is too long and detailed and too many vicissitudes occur to the actors in the story even for this world of change and chance but the tone and principle are good and the writing and dialogues easy and unaffected though some few expressions will rather offend the ear of fastidious readers many of the situations are dramatic and we may congratulate mrs wood on the fact that her fourth novel has not fallen off from thc promise of east lynne  vetrners pride it is p8si1le that people will soon get tlredl of thle sensation novel and yog1 ladies rill cease to thrill ovi e r bigamyv and miurder which fill oulr fitnshioualble lnovels as in the days of the minerva

worse a lady will soon be thoughmt a little odd or  a little fast who dloes not confine herself wlhollv to french novels the new school combines the viciousness of dick turpin with the shamn sentiment of guiy livingstoone without the truth of the first or the art of the second as women are the chief consumers and producers of novels and as what they ought to want is  a smooth tale generally of love to amuse and somewhat instruct them it does seem very odd that there should be such a run on crimie there is always enough in the ticsr with the advantage of not being nonsensical as well as shocking but if the interest felt in these vulgar lady as and lady is is mnerely bred by a literary toadyism then the case is still more hopeless we must however rive up the problem of why these books are read though we caln perhaps account for their beingr written a novel written hurriedly to order for a weekly periodical is expected to have a fixed amount of  sensation in each nunmber while it would he unreasonable to expect much artistic handling of the plot or delicate finish of detail such as made  adam bede almost a perfect novel just as the readers of the london journal or family herald qre weekly gratified by reading how the lady gwendolen shot two ruffians or the o l marquis was smitten ly heaven for his crimes so the more refined subscribers to the popular magazines expect at least a fresh murder or bigamy started in each number it is like reading a succession of slovenly repoits of a series of road murders some writers take special lines for instance a very celebrated authoress has almost monopolised the bigamy department  but the writer of verners pride has boldly attempted success in all sorts of crime at once the extraordinary success of  east lynne which appeared in a religious weekly paper led to a large sale of  the clhannings and mrs halliburtons troubles which are a mixture of diluted tonm browns schooldays  and reports on petty larceny verners pride is a still more ambitious attempt in the numbers of once a week it abandons the evangelical teaching of its predecessors and is confined to crime the plot is not over simple and yet is hardly worthy of being called a plot at all it has as much complicated action as would fill a story like the  woman in white  or  no name  but the improbability is not redeemed by skilful use of the theatrical apparatus of fiction which makes those novels amusing for a time the owner of the estate of  verners pride conceives that hie is bound to restore it at his death to the son of his elder brother rather than to leave it to his own stepsons on account however of suspecting his nephew to be the hero of a very brutal seduction and murder he alters his will the actual murderer might easily have been found by the police as one of the three young gentlemen was seen with the girl when she was drowned no one could say which of the three it was and the matter is allowed to rest in fact had the police come on the scene the book could not have gone on for the uncertainty allows each of the three in turn to be considered the murderer and in turn to tantalise a melodramatic brother who goes round the pond publicly and continually with a guin and only wants to shoot the right man in the right place shortly before the old mans death he alters his will again and gives back the estate to lionel by a codicil which is witnessed by an old friend and a doctor whose daughter has just married the reputed heir for his expectations of course as the doctor was by no means an interested witness it is strange that he should steal the codicil and thereby make his daughter the wife of the heir it is far stranger that no one suspects him though there was verners pride by mrs henry wood authoress of  east lynne london bradbury  evans no one else to do it stranger still that the ouisted owner only mutters something about police but iiever sends ftr them  and perhaps strangest of all that the wicked dloctr never destroys the codicil but persists in leavin it about so as tlwatys to be oln the vergre of discovery when at last an explosioln of cleijinals throws it before the riglht inan the doctor is mildly treated even then jan verner a comic character brings the news to the then owner of the land that codicil has come to light joliim u1led on viorously staring at jaii but zvei speakiiig the

untold gold  what a very extraordinary course of events seenii to have taken place with regard to verners pride  now vouir brotheris  now not his  theit his again then not his i cannot make it out but we muiiist mention some of the chief characters as wveii as the plot the hero lionel is rather like mtar arlxve in east lynniie le is meant to be perfect and is only dull  lie mnarries a1 widow sibylla but is all along mnakingr love to and kissing the other perfect character lucy at one time lie is certlaill that hils wifes first husband is alive  lie thinks it would le unfair to hcave her a inst her will she however remains under a protest that she intends to keep to the real owner of  verners pride whoever h  mlay be this brings us to the character of sibylla w0e do not ever remember to have read of a miore repulsively vulgar naid lad character she is however o1ny meant to be silly anl a little unprinciplld though very charming we should not so 111uich mind her robbing her husband or even twitting him cnt inualyv with  her first but when it comes to her chuckling at hilll and  cliafflng hint for the abovemnentioned seduction and murder which she looks on as a venial peccadthillo it is a little too bad the real culprit turns out to be her first husband but it would be impossible to showy fully the deep vulgarity of this character witoult d oing right through the book which we have done but cotld not conscientiously recommend to any one else it is not only vulgarity of language and bad english to which we ohject but it is to the whole character and the evident feeling of the writer that she has only drawn a frivolous little lady the other women in the book are not so objectionable there is a cold and haughty lady verner a good lady mary who makes love to the second hero a surgeon  also lucy beforenmentioned who is drawn as the perfection of female character and who makes rather broader love to the first hero then wve have a certain mrs peckaby comic who wants to be a morinon and certain iiysteriously bad characters who are kept in the background throughout the book we are only told that they are bad characters the comic characters are better than the serious because the vulgarity is not quite so apparent here the second hero is meant to be very comic jan is a surgeon brother to lionel verner who is always very blunt and simple sometlmnes to the verge of idiocy and who always dangles his legs there is a blacksmith peckaby who laughls at his wife for expecting a white donkev to take her to the new jerusalem and a master cheese who eats enormously each of these characters have their special point of conmedy and they are not in one single intance alluded to without miiaking that point it will be seen that the jokes must be very good not to be spoilt by all this repetition the estate of verners pride after fluctuating letweell lionel and his stepcousins john and frederick who are all in turn the owners finally comes to lionel the rough golddigrger john massingbird who was lead for the first volume and a half finally retires and does not continue his practice of impersonating his dead brother frederick as a ghost running round the pond where the poor girl died that refined joke produces a good deal of complication in the second volume and threatens at one time to make out lionel a bigamist  that is happily prevented by honest jan garotting the ghost then sibylla is removed by making her dance to death at a ball so that nothingr remains but the happy mnarriaoe of the hero and heroine this is delayed for a little time by the fact that lionel is in debt  and there is one pathetic scene where he tells lucy of it   i am a poor man now lucy worse than without prospects if you knew all and i do not know why you should not know all he added after a pause  i am in debt such a man cannot marry  the words were spoken quietly temperately their tone proving how hopeless could be any appeal against them whether from him from her or from without it was perfectly true lionel verners position placed him beyond the reach of social ties this passage may be taken as a fair sample of the sentimental parts of  verneris pride as we said before the broadly comic parts are better in style but monotonous  and we must say that the characters for the most part are either insipid unpleasant or vulrar we cannot therefore speak in very high terms of this i last specimen of the sensational or renaissance newgrate school either as to its plot its sentiments or its english  the literary examiner verner pride by mrs henry wood author of east lynne ac in three volumes bradbury and evans aurora floyd by m e braddon author of lady audleys secret in three volumes tinsley brothers the slight but kindly recognition of weak cleverness that is all the criticism fairly due from us to novels by the authoress of east lynne and the silence in which it would be kindness to pass over the crude coarse and prosaic tales of bigamy and murder by the authoress of lady audleys secret no longer fit the time when these writers have been forcedchiefly or altogether we fear by the misapplied laudations of a critic in the timesinto a popularity discreditable to the public taste the popularity no doubt is artificial largely made up of the applause of those who would be influenced in their judgement by announcements of tremendous success in an advertisement or street placard of miss braddon the authoress of lady audleys secret newspapers have been telling us lately that she was a provincial actress and a writer in reynoldss miscellany for that journal her style and matter were we can suppose perfectly well suited her novels are of the school of mr g w m reynolds literature of the kitchen as it used to be and to give currency to them among educated readers without placing the name of reynolds on a level with that of sir walter scott miss austin or mr dickens is a gross injustice how long too will society refuse to place the name of its smith beside that of its shakespeare there is a mr smith whose works of fiction appear in penny weeklies not yet fashionable and achieve an immense success among the class of readers whose coarse fare is now sought by the dainty he has we believe more readers than mr dickens why shall he not be fetched up out of the kitchen  a pleasant writer in one of the magazines this month pictures an exquisite gentleman to whom everything upon his daintilyappointed breakfast table is uneatable  did you ever asks his doctor who is breakfasting with him  try a red herring   here is a glorious idea here is an absolutely new sensation to be got the faithful serving man is dispatched immediately to fortnum and masons for a red herring he goes to a chandlers shop in a back alley to buy the herring and his master eats the whole of it with utmost relish there are some fastidious novel readers to whom one of miss braddons stories may have in this way the relish of a penny herring out of the back alley what is there to raise the novels of these ladies above mediocrity are they good in language thought or story  good writing will often cover weakness of invention original thought will give a true charm even to a tale careless in diction and poor in plot or a wellcontrived plot will make the fortune of a tale in which the writing is poor and all the thoughts are superficial in all mrs woods novels the language is weak sinning as nine average novels in ten do but much more than is customary against grammar and as the lady would say  to a degree we are very sure also that neither mrs wood nor miss braddon whose novels are coarser and worse than mrs woods has achieved in any book one shrewd and original thought at every turn of events that suggests reflection each lady punctually and exclusively provides her reader with the commonplace appointed for the occasion the merit may lie perhaps in the farfetched invention of their tales in which they labour to be sensational here however to mrs woods especial credit be it said one lady bases her fiction on a womanly notion of right and shows a sense of delicacy that restrains her from the coarser imaginings of the sensation novelist for this reason she is falling behind in the race she cannot give her mind sufficiently to the painting of a true halo of bigamy and murder about the head of any heroine or hero in this story of verneys pride mrs wood doubtless begins well enough as notions of a good beginning go by mysteriously drowning a seduced girl in a pond and raising a question of who put her in  four or five persons go through some part of the story with the now relishable game flavour of a taint of suspicion of murder on the readers mind and then in the second volume a first husband buried in australia is so distinctly supposed to have reappeared that the full relish of bigamy is given to a portion of the story but the murder proves after all to have been no murder a mere case of seduction and suicide and the bigamy is wiped out after it had been carefully painted in the reappeared husband proves to have been personated if mrs wood desires to run a race of popularity with miss braddon there must be no baulking of the readers appetite for bigamy and murder there must be constant addition instead of diminution of the dose of cayenne in the literary curry it is more than time that we had three husbands to embarrass any really interesting heroine lady audley was glad to think she had got rid of her first by putting him down the well and then only tried to rid herself of an inconvenient inquirer by burning him in his bed but think of the shifts and perplexities of a wife with eight husbands being not only mysteriously married like aurora floyd to her noble husbands horsetrainer but also to the beadle of whose cane she is in dread and also to the emperor of china who writes compromising letters by each mail the more compromising as she is also secretly married to the postman who is of a suspicious temper and may open any letter addressed to her also under peculiar circumstances to the giant of a show that is coming to be wt up at a fair in the neighbourhood also to a maniac whom she keeps ia the cellar for whioh reason aa ta f ro to th in m wi jo joi j j mi rei bli alone carries the key of the cellar and also to the rector of the parish who believes her to be on a friendly visit at the grand house which must always be in the centre of the stories of this school medea blenkinsop or the octogamist or pails of bloodwhat a tale might be made of it think of the mere difficulty between two husbands the squire and rector of the parishhow to keep them from knowing that they both had the same wife  what floods of interesting lies the heroine would have to tell this is the direction in which mrs wood must travel if she is to retain her popularity she must not think to make a sensation with mere makebelieve bigamy let her study punch read in the profound pages of that philosopher the thrilling romance of  mokeanna and write something like that we forget how many slops of fiction a sensation writer of the new school usually drops at a time say three then how delicious would be the exercise of ingenuity in threading the maze among three dozen or more husbands of three fair polygamist heroines before breakfast medea blenkinsop having by great ingenuity got her husband the beadle up into the belfry stands below pulls a rope and crushes his head with the clapper of the great bell as the bone crushes between bell and clapper there is a muffled toll that strikes into the heart of every villager author going to breakfast upon devilled herring leaves mrs blenkinsop at the bellrope and coming back resumes the midnight conversation in another story between the black ratcatcher and his wife the marchioness of bloodybones in deadmans lane she was left on the point of paying him two thousand pounds to go away  we are  observed says he and authoress proceeds to bring a hunchback into the hedge who picks the ladys pocket of her handkerchief and after she has gone with that handkerchief smothers the ratcatcher leaving him with the marchionesss cypher and initials hanging out of his mouth the author dines on pork pie and plum cake and returns to the affairs of a third heroine who has a will to forge before explaining in a soliloquy how the relentless hand of destiny has made her what she is and she is more to be pitied than blamed for having married and poisoned twentyseven of her lovers he for whom she stealthily retires to sweeten a nightdraught is the twentyeight she will fly to sunny italy tomorrow with the stableboy we have not yet quite reached this perfection of sensation writing but are fairly on the way to it and now let us look to mrs wood who with all her faults is a writer more worth notice than miss braddon for some illustrations of the sort of english that is suitable to a sensation novel verners pride is the name of a house built by old mr verner to replace another on the same estate that was  a high narrow old thing the old man had two sons one his companion at home the other colonel sir lionel who had a boy at eton when the old man grew near to death sir lionel  was bade get leave of absence if possible but he also being dead verners pride was bequeathed to his brother not to his son the son of the eldest son the youth at eton who becomes the hero of the story thc new master of verners pride married  a widow lady of the name of massingbird who had two nearly grownup sons john and frederick these lived at verners pride with young lionel the adopted son and natural heir of the property it was frederick massingbird who seduced rachel frost he is a sly villain with a sensation mark upon his face  a very strangelooking mark indeed quite as large as a pigeons egg with  what looked like radii shooting from it on all sides  some of the villagers talking familiarly among them selves would call it a hedgehog some would call it a  porkypine but it resembled a star as much as anything  that is if you can imagine a black star the mark  was black as jet and his pale cheek and the fact of his possessing no whiskers made it all the moro con 8picuous bi this sort of portraitpainting is emphatic enough certainly but to make it more so the author gives mr frederick a habit of gently rubbing his finger round and round the mark on his cheek there is an emphatic way too of putting the effect of a discovery  it electrified  deerham it electrified mrs verner it worse than elec trifled matthew frost and robin by another incident  lionel mrs verner jan and sir rufus hautley were  petrified there is an emphatic ordering of words too with which mrs wood produces comical effects in this manner it is not written  she sat down on a chair but it is written  down on a chair sat she or  one laid  hold of his head another of his feet but make  nothing of him could they or  it caused quite  a confusion the entrance of dr west dislocation of the limbs of sentences with full stops fired like bullets into them is another way of bringing readers up with a mild jerk mrs verner  was rather addicted to dropping  asleep with her last glass of wine and waking up with the teatray as she did on this evening lucy  noticed that he had left the parchment behind him and ran after him with it catching him as he was about to  close the halldoor here mrs wood is comically solemn with a semicolon after a wedding breakfast sir ed mund and lady hautley had left then but those who re maincd wanted some dinner and had it we first see john massingbird in his brothers presence preparing for a journey to australia stowing his litter into the boxes  not  all sixes and sevens like it looked as it lay but compactly  and artistically  he was the bestlooking of the two mrs woods misuse of the word like is habitual we read of  a heavy groan born of displeasure miogled with  pain like the greeting look had been here are two blunders in one sentence suddenly be went straight upgil w p1 th th ch or at be t ik id jg eis is a ly er g n b in af  i 3 t 1 a r s 58 ie r f e a f ie i is e f

apparently with great gusto like anybody else might taste port wine  and finally jan poured the lot down his  own throat lionel  like many another has done before him suffered a moments impassioned impulse to  hx the destiny of a life the two conductors of a painted donkey  were muffled up as befitted the inclemency  of the night something like their voices appeared to have been no detached evidence of the slipslop of mrs woods style and  east lynne was in this respect worse not better than vernors pride will convey to one who has not read the book itself the impression of illwritten english that every page of her writing gives even when it contains no technical faults lionel verner comes in for the tail of the dinner john set on to spend his portion as fast as he could to be  sometime the mistress of verners pride was a very vista of desire mrs wood has some such notion of the meaning of a vista as we might expect from a lady who blends direct vulgarity with the indirect vulgarity in use of fine phrases common among the uneducated from lionel to lady verner a hint is sufficient  to induce her to preserve reticence what is in a small house too narrow to be called a hall mrs wood calls not a passage but a vestibule pretty mrs massingbird showing her face unexpectedly to lionel  for one single  moment lionel was lost in the beauty of the vista in connexion with a country doctor we have a new use of the word auspices  jans window being as you may  remember nearly on a level with the ground presented favourable auspices for holding a facetoface colloquy  with night visitors when does mrs wood think that a man is not a being   jan went on like a steamengine lionel remained stand ing at his entrance gate more like a prostrate being than a  living man a rough soldier captain cannonby who has tossed about the world and who speaks of his brother the doctor making  a sight of money tells of the death in his presence of frederick massingbird in australia  he died  at early dawn just as the sun bunt out to illumine the  heavens lionel on one of the occasions of his being dislodged from verners pride would study lawbooks and  says the fair authoress  awfully dry work he found it  not in the least congenial and many a time did he long  to pitch the whole lot c beyond mrs duffs shop you  come upon an opening on the left hand which led  to quite a swarm of cottages mrs verner was  put  to shifts by the bailiffs death  you ascertained no certain news of john massingbird i hear observed lady verner sibylla also knew and she read  arightly the drooping of their faces of a number of women it is said that  they to hear them talk would rather have enjoyed an encounter solus with the ghost than not  roy spoke unusually impressive for him lucy says to lionel  mr cust had used to tell us jan the surgeon says of sibyllas temper you remember how it had  used to be with her at home sibylla is thought weak in the chest  not more weak than i had used to be9 she answers lionel says  i cannot reconcile it to my conscience mother to remain on here his mother says  you will give up this london scheme will you  not and remain on elsewhere   lionel declined the  grog but he remained on talking things over afterwards john massingbird remained on with him his  guest eat stands for ate  we had a beautiful piece of roast beef and im sure you eat as much as you  chose  dr west had accepted a cup of coffee he  kept it in his hand sipping it now and then and slowly  eat a biscuit  nightfogs are pernicious to a degree says this physician john massingbird spoke to the doctor  with his mouth full of devilled kidneys and  could  not by any manner of means be induced  to take his hints but the rough john with diggers habits usually says  deemed  for thought and of his smoking in bed says tynn lives in perpetual torment lest my bed  should ignite some night lucy  sat with ber  head a little bent scenting her verbena lucy the refined and educated heroine warns lionel against a danger saying  i know you will not see it for yourself  and that is the reason why i am presumptive enough to suggest the idea to you for which consideration we are told directly afterwards lionel  could not help  pressing her hand warmer than was needful as he placed  her in the carriage in despair over her own grammar mrs wood uses pronouns in place of nouns and adds the nouns lest the pronouns should point in the wrong direction  decima went indoors for some string to tie up a fuchsia  plant just as she tynn appeared at the iron gates

matter is less characteristic in more than one outstanding lady novelist wo have noted the determined adoption of passing mannerisms and ephemeral catchwords with the frequent result of loss of originality of outlook and expression the author of faustina had once on a time a sufficient grasp of the nature and habits of average girlhood and her way of presenting her observations was her own

republication as the novels of miss austen they never weary their interest is sever lost for as in the prints of hogarth we find fresh matter for admiration upon every renewal of our acquaintance her fables ore of the simplest construction her incidents in the common course of things and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation the story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases there are no exaggerations and no deficiencies and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fullness of the effect is produced the persons described are such as we meet every day in society but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of actionthe one illustrating the otherand moreover most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates self is a great disturber of the observing faculties in miss austens novels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world and free from the engrossment of acting a part in it we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked the commonplace characters of the town and the village are the characters which miss austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood in the story before us what an example of the worthless is mr johii dashwoodnot the wormhless in the common acceptation of the word implying positive vice but the worthless negative of worth of which common character miss austen has evinced a perfect

stamp of circulatinglibrary popularity put upon her works before the superior judges had become acquainted with them and recognised their high degree of excellence the quarterly review to its honour be it remembered was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius it is remarkable that scott who noticed with praise many inferior authors never mentioned miss austen perhaps because she was not an inferior author perhaps for the same reason that caused sir walter to consider fieldings incomparable satire jonathan wild only as a story the present judicious blication is we see to be followed by  emma  northanier abbey  mansfield park and persuasion but suely it cannot be intended to omit  pride and prejudice which s at once the best and the most popular of the austen novels,ovel

B4915,['9185335'],  the wyvern mystery a novel new novels by j s le fanu 3 vols tinsley brothers much will not be said in behalf of  the wyvern mystery by those mild and commonplace people who think that a novel should aim rather at the exhilaration than the depression of the readers spirits that it should forbear to give pain which is not calculated to enhance the effect of its pleasurable representations that its illustrations of the evil should be put in contrast against equally vivid exhibitions of the good of human nature and that at the end it should leave the reader in the intellectual and moral condition of a man who has been listening to fiue music or contemplating a noble work of art or enjoying the stimulus of good company on the contrary by those many persons who delight in strong hysterical emotions and are of opinion that the romancewriter labours within the proper province of his art when he alternately freezes the readers heart and causes his hair to stand on end by pictures of eccentric vice and cruel violence a rush will be made to the libraries for the new tale of the novelist whose present performance surpasses all his previous wild stories in sensational inhumanity that the book overflows with cleverness and force no reader will deny but mr sheridan le fanu adds nothing to his reputation by another display of literary adroitness and melodramatic ability it must also be conceded that much labour has been expended on the first two volumes the separate parts of which are fitted together with the most precise and cunning workmanship and that the character of mildred tarnleythe faithful honest harsh old servingwoman who tells innumerable falsehoods in her masters service whilst she sharply censures his misconduct and sturdily declines to flatter himsecures the book from a charge of being altogether deficient in humour the naturalness of the other feminine characters is not conspicuous but the three principal men of the dramaold squire fairfield of wyvern and his two sonsare creatures of human flesh and blood surcharged with some of the most odious qualities of the race that they dishonour the harsh despotic scurrilous squire of wyvern a brute whose abusive tongue respects neither virtue nor the grave is not untrue to a period when englishmen of common stuff albeit of ancient pedigree used to think it a proof of manly spirit to bully their dependents and drink themselves at least once a day into stupefaction the disdainful abhorrence roused by the selfishness and moral imbecility of the squires elder son who by marrying alice maybell does her the greatest injury it is in his power to inflict upon her is evidence of the skill with which his despicable nature is portrayed and though harry fairfieldwho combines the smart  slanginess  of foker and the meanness of barnes newcome with the niggardliness of miser elwesis a more revolting specimen of the cheat sneak and cad than we have ever before encountered in prose fiction the picture of his loathsomeness does not surpass the bounds of possibility or even wander beyond the lines of experience the opening chapters of the narrative introduce the reader to alice maybell a fair and fortuneless beauty soon after her secret marriage with charles fairfield and to her patron the abusive old squire of wyvern who having in consideration of remote consanguinity extended patronage to her otherwise friendless infancy and girlhood is of opinion that the charming woman should reward his past kindness by consenting to be the wife of his failing years taking this view of her obligations the aged savage woos the frightened girl with a grotesque and boisterous amorousness that reminds us of squire westerns least delicate demeanour in the presence of ladies  and when alice escapes at the same time from his importunities and his house and flies with her bankrupt husband to a desolate and dilapidated old mansion not many miles distant from wyvern the furious dotard curses the pair with the choicest imprecations to be found in his comprehensive vocabulary of abuse and ere long he has grounds for flattering himself that his amiable wishes have not been ineffectual in carwell grange the miserable dwelling to which charles fairfield takes his bride even as a few years earlier he had brought the recentlydiscarded mistress who plays an important part in the drama alices life ia wretched and unseemly that he may not draw his impatient creditors upon him or reveal his lurkingplace to the emissaries of the woman who instead of consenting to her banishment from his presence declares that she is his wife the feeble and broken roui conceals himself from observation and forbids his bride to communicate to her nearest female friends their hidingplace at the grange their only servantsare mildred tarnley and a slatternly kitchen wench and for months their only visitor i harry fairfield who now and then rides over to carwell to eat and drink at his impoverished brothers expense to smoke the spendthrifts cigars and to urge him to proceed yet further on the road to ruin at length however another visitor arrives at the grange in the person of a blind and unspeakably hideous dutch woman named bertha velderkaust who effects an entrance into the mansion during charlesfairfields absence and whilst alice is in bed of berthas peculiarities it is enough to say that in addition to blindness and the disfigurements of smallpox they comprise a strong appetite for opium and brandy a temper given to maniacal ebullitions of rage and a demoniacal hatred of the woman who has supplanted her in her former paramours affections having contrived to enter the house and terrorised mildred tarnley into giving her a supper and

spring alice evaded the stroke through the intervention of timely aid alice escapes from her murderous assailant who is seized and consigned to the county prison where instead of exhibiting an anxiety for her own fate at the approaching assizes she vows vengeance on her former keeper whom she accuses of having committed bigamy but ere the wyvern  mystery can be unravelled by lawyers in a publio court the position of affairs is changed by the sudden death of charles wyvern shortly before alice gives birth to the boy with whose fortunes the remainder of the story principally concerns itself after charless death the interest of the tale sensibly diminishes and more than once in the course of the third volume the threads of the narrative seem to be falling from the weavers hand whilst he appears to be in doubt how to work them into an appropriate ending acting in harmony with his previous conduct harry fairfield gets possession of his brothers son puts him out of sight and makes alice believe that the little fellow is dead calling death to help him out of his perplexities the narrator kills old squire wyvern whose dying moments are worthy of the life that has preceded them and sends bertha velderkaust to the next world finally harry fairfield is shot in a fray with poachers and expires after making a confession that cooperates with other incidents to explain the wyvern

of their words or actions the heroine is a charming little girl who grows up to be a still more charming woman but all her fine and generous qualities ore made into weapons which aro turned by others against her own happiness this is a tragedy which often occurs iu real life when individuals who aro richly endowed with gifts of heart and iutellect are not able to hold these gifts in their duo proportion and cannot use them to advantage it may be that they seem to need a virtue less rather than a virtue more but in reality it i3 though faculty of discrimination that is neededtho power to discern the greater from the less so as to know in what proportion generosity ought to mingle with justicewhen selfsacrifice is heroic and when it is simply a reckless impulse of selfindulgence in the emotion of the present moment where this faculty compendiously called common sense is wanting the more precious the qualities with which the individual is endowed the more mischief they seem to do him but also if the individual to his own self be true neither the mischief nor the suffering is fatal ultimately the mistakes tend to the higher development of character the worst of it is that this life is often too short for the uses of experience and individuals who have once made shipwreck are not always strong enough for another venture and bo in the eyes of the unwise  they seem to fail altogether but mere success is not the measure of all that is good and to be desired thia is the idea which underlies the story of  once and again and it is made extremely interesting the heroine and

family of a professor who are in very poor circumstances caused by though bail temper and worse conduct of though professor mgastineau himself these three households are the groundwork in which the

has been worked upon through her generosity through her fear of giving pain through her fear of seeming proud to give young gastineau a rash promise to marry no one for three years this is very cleverly done and it is very true to female human nature she does not love gastineau she does not want to promise she knows it is not right but she is afraid to give him pain or to be unkind and she is also overawed by his vehemence so she not only gives him the promise but when she and her mother leave to return to paris she confirms it and hence most of the troubles that befall her when she has bound herself she soon finds out to her cost what it is to make a promise for gastineau has nothing of the gentleman in his naturehe uses his power meanly ultimately she obtains her freedom  but her mothers violent exaggerations drive her to desperation and she impetuously rushes into an engagement to marry the stupidemptyhearted nephew of the marquis who only proposes to her in the idea that through her favour with his uncle he shall come into his fortune she tries to do her duty and to make wrong right but her good qualities seem only to make her efforts more hopeless we cannot follow all the complications that ensue nor enter upon gaatineaus dastardly revenge though story throughout is very interesting the conclusion leaves her a widow free from all the mistakes of her early life which she has fairly worked out and learned the leeson they taught she is still young enough to have much hope before her and the author assures us she becomes a happy woman we recommend our readers

string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends who were neither slow nor cold in recognising the merits of his earlier stories and who sincerely regret the imperfections of his present book he clearly stands in need of repose and we urge him to rest now so that heand wemay be thankful for better work hereafter,ovel
B237,['8595958'],  literatube the city of sunshine the citij of sunshine by alexander allardyce w blackwood and sons as a rule there is no more unromantic mortal living than the angloindian the  gryphon  and enthusiastic specials who skim the surface of the land in a cool season are indeed prone to break into glowing periods concerning the gorgeous east but the effect produced upon the european character by any prolonged residence in the most picturesque and at the same time the most humourous country in the world would appear to be almost invariably commonplaceness and unalterable gravity the reason is not of course difficult to discover there are awkward practical qualities underlying indian picturesqueness and indian absurdity which tend to detract from their charm with though national prepossession in favour of the more solid virtues it is difficult for the average englishman to retain any delight in the flowery jungle or the fairylike grotesqueness of though native bazaar when he has learned that the one means lurking snakes and poisonous miasmas and the other any number of grave offences against salubrity in the same way he ceases to be attracted by patriarchal habits and romantic beliefs when he finds that these by no means indicate the manly qualities of energy and uprightness but after all it is a part of the englishmans philistinism his meiitorious philistinism no doubt but philistinism notwithstanding to dislike or despise the romance of india because of her deficient respectability this deficiency is not to be denied  as far as thc respectable virtues go india has some cause to feel ashamed but her shortcomings here are after all but negatiae qualities thc result of applying to her a foreign standard the positive quality the distinguishing fact about herself and her people is not respectability nor the lack of respectability but romance she is only to be seen truthfully and interpreted justly when looked at from the romantic viewpoint so that it is really to le regretted that just those people who know most about ber refuse either to see or to paint her for us under this her most lovable and vital aspect mr allardyce ave hasten to say forms a brilliant exception to though rule evidently he is under no illusions himself as to the character of the mild hindoo ho does not attempt to attribute to him any of the heroic virtues nor does he represent india after though manner of the gushing special as a paradise of luxuriant splendour he is content to paint her as he finds her as imagination and experience have shoavn her to himwith all her faults and aveakness her unreliability caprices and deceits but at the same time with all her dreamy fascination  her grace her pathetic tenderness above all her poetry which hides a multitude of sins the  city of sunshine as its description stands in our novel will do for the picture of almost any bengal village of tolerable size there is the picturesque little temple under the fluttering peepnltree though dilapidated but imposinglooking mansion of the poor native nobleman of the place  the tawdry stucco dwelling of the rich mabajan or moneylender  and then the street of quaint little open shops either linc broken here and there by high brick avails oaershadowed by largeleaved plantains mr allardyce is sufficient artist to people his little world with none save living

village  from kristo lahory the proud and poor brabmau to three shells the moneylender and arillain of the story are true not only to life bnt to natiate life the reader may learn as much from studying even this little side group of secondary personages as from spending many hours in the actual dust and heat and bustle of an indian bazaar but there are two studies of a much higher dramatic order testifying not only to the authors exceptional grasp of the shades and colour of character but also of his clear sense of the very questionable improvement for moral worth or personal happiness to bo effected by encouraging young india to make one mouthful of all european intellectualism much after the manner that the ancestral sage vasistha swalloaaed the thunderbolt of brahma  with much the samo results alsoof sore inward burnings and outward vomitings of smoke inasmuch as the noble human spirit or thc spirit which just falls short of being noble is always a higher matter of study

little by little krishnas new religious fervour melts away under the influence of his love and his fathers generous kindness though romantic attractions of the old religion begin to exercise a dreamy

flickering faith krishna has all though poetic sensitiaeness and refinement of the higbcasto oriental and the shallow vulgarity and hybrid anglicism of his lowborn countryman finish the work of bia

cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet novel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to express by the phrase quiet novel a work such as the vicar of wakeifiold oriiiri ciniawinnsthe trollope series of fictionsreaders of contemporary romances will have met with dozeus of quiet novels

us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the

production before us contains literally nothing with any pretence to interest which is not unnatural and nothing true to nature which is worth the trouble of reading whether it be that fate has given its author just that amount of power with his pen which a wasp has with its stingto use it once at whatever time his pleasure dictates and so expend its usefulness for ever or whether it be that success has made him too sanguine and too hasty in endeavouring to follow it up we are not anxious to decide in either case we forewarn him from the fate of these three whited sepulchres he will have

B5997,"['9069208', '6799347', '9460231']",  i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen  co mr maxwells latest novel is virtually an elaborate and conscientious portrait of a temperament all the interest centres in one dominant personality the figure of a strong man with a titanic capacity and a passion for work john barnards ambition is an almost superhuman obsession he loves his work for its own sake as well as for the rewards it is to bring him he rejoices alike in his own power and in the contest but in the struggle for success his domestic happiness suffers shipwreck eventually his health breaks down in such a manner that the world of action is completely closed to him while the life of thought and introspection opens the latter portion of the book is an interesting study in morbid pathology skilfully and even impressively done the main flaw in this cleverly told story is the psychological development of lady edith the wife which just misses being convincing through imperfect realization we cannot believe in her departure from the path of virtue  i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen and co 6s every novelist is a psychologist nowadays the clash of mind with mind or the influence of mind upon mind forms the basis of ninetenths of our modern highly strung love stories not many writers however are as successful as is mr maxwell in delineating his characters in this latest novel from his pen we have perhaps as cleverly contrived a situation as he has ever given usthe antagonism between a man whose ideal is work work directed to one end and a woman whose ideal is love barnard who is rapidly rising in the financial world and means to rise to the top marries lady edith rathkeale in a severe attack of lovesickness she consenting sees in his tenderness the promise of a lifetimes happy comradeship he is never rough with her nor is he ever unkind or thoughtless but he simply does not understand her and is content in a placid unemotional way with the comforts of home which he samples between the rushes of business his wife gradually breaks down but by far the more serious collapse comes to barnard himself and a third of the book is taken up by the story of this failure of nerve and the effort to cure that strong overstrained brain we must say that here the interest flags considerably in spite of the long and wellwritten conversations the end is in view all the time and the reader grows restless on the whole however the situation is splendidly handled and the gradual drifting apart of husband and wife is portrayed very finely to make both of them seek consolation elsewhere was we think inartistic and a concession to the methods of the feujileton which the author should have resisted the redhaired typist and secretary with whom barnard has an  affair  is far too melodramatic to be convincing and the scene between her and lady edith carries little conviction barnard is capital with his colossal conceit of himself leave j b to his unfettered discretion  i john barnard he reminds us of the great joe bagstock the ending is sad but true to life and in the general scheme of his story mr maxwell proves himself a psychologist of no mean order   the wifes evidence by w g wills 3 vols j hurst  blackett i in the wifes evidence there are the materials for an excellent novel of strong interest j if the author would only have told his tale quietly and steadily the subject is unhackneyed and there are skill and originality in  building up the incidents and drawing the i characters but the author loses time and space by indulging in declamatory bits of elo quence and in the desire to be dramatic he  has weakened the effect of a story sufficiently remarkable to need no adventitious aid of rhetoric the outline of the tale is briefly as follows a son long estranged from home by a quarrel with his father has married made his own way in the world and been for some time successful as a literary man and editor of a journal he is however at the opening of the story on the verge of bankruptcy the first scenes are merely introductory to show the character of the man and the nature of the charming good wisehearted wife whom he is so fortunate as to possess screening her brother who having been his confidential clerk had embezzled a large sum of money has been the real cause of colemans embarrassments and nearly of his disgrace coleman will not disclose the secret of a man whom he has pardoned and who is repenting his crime but his wife proves the facts and his good name is cleared the wilful character of the man in adhering to a course of action he has once adopted is well illustrated in these preliminary scenes but they are too long and too minutely drawn out they detain the reader from the main interest of the tale after the affairs of the bankruptcy are wound up coleman his wife and child go into somersetshire to stay with his mother now a widow and sole mistress of the paternal acres her character is well and clearly drawn full of good sense and geniality she has also a vein of fierce untractable matteroffact implacability lying beneath the surface mother and son resemble each other in their dogged tenacity of purpose she and her son have never been estranged all these years they have been in regular correspondence and on his fathers death she would have had him home only that he was then following his own career in london she receives him and his wife with a hearty welcome whilst little johnny their son is the delight of her heart the return to the old home and the description of the life there led are well done the character of coleman is well developed with his quaint genial humour his tenderness for his wife and the gnarled perverse knot of obstinacy in his nature with which only his wife can deal domesticated in the family they find the farm bailiff a rude florid coarse goodlooking man who had become manager of the farm on the death of the husband when coleman could not or would not return to take his own place as head of the family in the years that have elapsed the bailiff has secured his influence and coleman discovers that his mother is on the brink of marrying him fondly hoping that they may still continue to live together as a happy family all this story is well and skilfully told the scene between mother and son is extremely good and the character of the old woman is very true to human nature when her son reproaches her with disrespect to his fathers memory lowe your father nothingshe said your father did me a mean turn which i have not forgotten and shant forget to my dying day your aunt dora could tell you all about it its no matter no matter but you have minded me of a good reason for what i mean to do for gods sake what has my father done mother which could influence you to sacrifice yourself i always believed that you and my father lived happily eh dear happily that is the happiness i never talk of injustice or wrongs but i dont think of em the less not much happened since then in this quiet house to put em out of my mind then to the quiet astonishment of her son who scarcely trusted his ears she gave him the history with feminine bitterness and detail of a certain velvet mantle which her husband had long promised her and made a deal of fuss about when it arrived she could have put a piedish under cither shoulder it was such an illfit and she wished to have it sent back and altered what do you think he did will he tumbled the mantle into its box and sent it off as a present to your aunt dora the woman of all the world i hate the most and he told me to my face a few days after that he had heard from her to say it was a good fit for her i have done him many a kind turn since that will and i sat up for six nights with him when he wab dying without ever taking off my clothes but i tellee i was thinking of that drees when i looked from my window and saw the velvet on his hearse with all this implacability there is a simple straightforwardness in the old lady which wins the readers sympathy shemarries the bailiff with a guileless trust that is almost heroic of course though natural result followshe has married her for her money and proves a coarse tyrant her son and his wife stay beside her to shield and comfort her and to be ready to take her away when she is willing to go but the catastrophe comes quickly personally illused her husband drawing all her hardlysaved money and squandering it in riotous living bringing his mistress into the house the wretched old woman is maddened with indignation one night coming home drunk after a lengthened absence he insults her beyond her power to endure he reels upstairs to bed and she fetches a hatchet and murders him in his sleep her son hearing a noise goes to her room and finds her standing with the hatchet in her hand the necessity for action the instinct to saare his mother at whatever cost prompt him to take measures which have the effect of involving him in a aveb of suspicious and incriminating circumstances his avife who alone could have given the information which avould have cleared him is kept by him out of the way at the coroners inquest the result is that he is committed for trial along with the old lady as guilty of the murder he then deliberately resolves to sacrifice himself his wife and child and to save his mother a wife cannot give evidence in a criminal case either for or against her husband eleanors despair her efforts her baffled endeavours to make the truth heard are well described but in the last volume the style is throughout declamatory and rhetorical which aveakens the effect the quietest and most steady avriting was needed to make the working out of colemans fanaticism probable or pleasant he prefers his mother to his avise and child and having decided to save her it needed great delicacy and good management on the part of the author to carry the sympathy of the reader with him but he wastes all his strength to illustrate the hardship of the law that prevents a wife bearing testimony for her husband and to this purpose the symmetry and strength of the novel is sacrificed coleman trifles with his avife deceives her keeps her at arms length and behaves to her in a manner entirely unworthy of her faithfulness and courage the whole of the last volume is hurried there is a want of good workmanship which is the more provoking as the author has shown himself quite capable of the mechanism of his craft all that passes after the trial is weak and confused a condemned murderer is not allowed to leave his cell and go out into the avorld on a mere  reprieve the statement of the old lady given under the influence of an overdose of laudanum would have required corroboration and her confession is so hazy that it reads more like the murmuring of delirium than a definite statement the scene between eleanor and her husband in prison when she brings him the good news is feeble and unsatisfactory the author appears to have become weary of his task or else to have considered it unnecessary to finish up his work in a businesslike manner he gives all his care and attention to the sensation scenes instead of considering his work as a whole the character of michael the irish retainer is clever and his mode of dealing with the witnesses is amusingly characteristic but there is too much of him and he is too stagey to touch the sympathy of the reader the author of the wifes evidence is capable of writing a powerful wellsustained novel and we hope he will give us one that will do justice to his talent,ovel
B5085,"['9426864', '4855285']",  guy deverell new novels by j s le fanu 3 vola i bentley  guy deverell is a tale which is well told and light in hand it is easy to read and will draw the reader on to the end it is not a sensation novel and those who have read  uncle silas will be surprised and perhaps a trifle disappointed to find the broad natural daylight iu which the whole story stands revealed there is certainly a green chamber which plays an important part in the catastrophe but it is not a haunted room and the book may be read in the loneliest nook at any hour of the night without shock to the nerves of a timid reader there are two highlywrought and very powerful scenes in  guy deverell which prove that mr le fanu can do something better than evoke eerie terrors whilst he can write an episode like that of the discovery of lady jane lennox by her husband he has no need to seek to excite sensations by murders and mysteries in ruinous manorhouses the story of lady jane lennox has but slight and accidental connexion with the main thread of the novel it is made the means of bringing about retribution on a worthless man but it is quite a forced conclusion for m verbarriere who represents the eumenides in his own person has no need to betray lady jane or to denounce her to her husband it does not assist his own designs nor further any ends of justice the elderly lover for whom the beautiful lady jane betrays her excellent husband is the hero of the novel sir jekyl marlowe is a bad worthless man of the jolly dog type of humanity which was fashionable when the first gentleman of europe was regent he inspires no sentiment in the reader he is said to be elegant in manner and handsome in person but as for his elegance he is perpetually chuckling he chuckles and leers at buxom landladies taps them on the cheek calls them  pretty little devils  rogues  and  wicked little conjurors also he has attacks of gout and in a novel gout is quite fatal to any tender interest sir jekyl is also a man without heart or any sense of honour he has had some very ugly antecedents in years gone by he first ruined a young man hy gambling and then shot him down unfairly in a duel besides all this he has inherited the young mans fortune which fell to him in conse quence of the iniquitous conduct of his own father the bad sir harry marlowe who had gtolen a certain important deed the possession of the illgotten wealth troubled the wicked old gentleman on his deathbed and he had made his son the present sir jekyl swear solemnly to make restitution of the deed telling him where it was to be found also he had solemnly enjoined him to pull down the wing of the house containing the green chamber which wing had been added by sir harry himself sir jekyl fulfilled neither of his fathers injunctions and the novel shows how he came to grief in consequence twenty years after he had come into possession of the estate being then a widower with an only child a daughter as fair as jephthas he is startled very unpleasantly by the sudden appearance of a young man the exact counterpart of his early friend whom he had ruined and murdered and whose inheritance he is unjustly enjoying guy deverell was the name of his victim guy strangways is the name of the young man who is his counterpart but as guy deverell was certainly dead and as assuredly buried he cannot be the same person and sir jekyl tries to believe the resemblance is only a disagreeable coincidence with guy strangways there is a stout saturnine elderly frenchman m verbarrifere whom he calls uncle sir jekyl is impelled to cultivate the acquaintance of the strangers who are travelling for pleasure to see the things worthy of note in the neighbourhood he invites them to his house and they come m verbarriere to pick up information and to spy out secrets especially to ascertain the mystery of the  green chamber the young man comes to fall in love with beatrix tne daughter of his host the reader is soon made aware that the two strangers have designs upon sir jekyls peace m verbarriere is in reality the friend who stood by poor guy deverell when he was shot down in the duel and though at the time unable to make the affair known being himself under proclamation of outlawry he still held fast to though purpose of avenging his friend having amassed a fortune in india he had returned to england to execute justice on sir jekyl bringing with him his nephew the son of poor guy deverell by a secret marriage with m verbarrires sister more than this we shall not say for the secret of a novel is a possession of the author and his reader  new novels guy deverell by f sheridan le fanu three vols r bentley m 1r le fanus name is not to be found in messrs routledges new edition of men of the time a dictionary of eminent living characters of both sexes which consists of 860 pages closely printed in double columns not that such an omission matters much where the name is really that of an eminent person for the compiler appears never to have heard of rdnan taine or herbert spencer and such books are chiefly valuable as furnishing the names of those who hang on great mens skirts of whom no other record exists the object in searching there for that of mr le fanu was to ascertain at what period the author of  uncle silas  made his first appearance as a novelist we believe that mr le fanu was first introduced to the public in the pages of the dublin university magazine in which appeared in monthly instalments  the house by the churchyard afterwards published in 1863 by messrs tinsley brothers in three volumes though by no means a high class novel that tale of irish life gave promise of something better for the future  for nothing can be more natural and lifelike than chapelizod its garrison and inhabitants the very language too if not equal to carletons had the true ring and smack about it but as the tale progresses the interest ceases and all ends in confusion mr le fanus second novel was wylders hand  which was followed at the close of last year by uncle silas both of which were noticed at considerable length in our second january number of the present year what was there stated can only be repeated now mr le fanu is an eminently disappointing author in  the house by the churchyard he came out well in what we may call scenery and decorations  in  wylders hand he proved that he could invent and tell a good story in uncle silas he sketched one figure at least with great power for in the character of millicent he shows that he does not want for sympathy with pleasant and innocent human nature whilst in his present tale by overindulging his appetite for the monstrous and horrible he tyres his reader and destroys the interest of the story even before the perusal of the first volume has been accomplished  guy deverell has been served up in monthly slices to the readers of the dtublin university magazine as a separate slice each had to be seasoned to suit the palate of the reader as a whole too much of the monstrous and horrible has spoiled the dish sir jekyl marlowe i a man of many thousand acres and member for the county accidentally meets with two strange gentlemen at a roadside inn the younger one so strongly reminds him of a dead relative that he hurries after them to a ruined abbey near by which they had gone to seeill see this fellow face to face and talk a bit with him i dare say if one were near hes not at all so like it i8 devilish odd though twentyfive years and not a relation on

parallelogram and given the young man an invitation to marlowe he asks boldly for his name in return my name is guy strangways said the stranger  0ho  its very odd exclaimed the baronet in a sharp snarl quite unlike his previous talk i think the distance between them was a little increased and he was looking askance upon the young gentleman who made him a very low foreign bow there was a silence and just then a deep metallic voice from below called guyhollo   excuse mejust a moment and the young man was gone the baronet waited hell be back muttered sir jekyl in a minute but the baronet was mistaken he waited at that open window whistling out upon the deepening twilight till the edges of the ivy began to glitter in the moonbeams and the bats to trace their zigzags in the air and at last he gave over ewecting xi elooked back into the gloomy void of that great chamber and listened and felt rather angry at his queer sensations he had not turned about when the stranger withdrew and did not know the process of his vanishing and for the first time it struck him who the plague could the fellow who called him be  an impression is thus at once created in the mind of sir jekyl of the supernatural the next appearance of guy strangways and his friend is at wardlock church where lady alice redeliffe the mother of beatrix the beautiful daughter of wicked sir jekyl are in the  reddliffe seat in the centre of the gallery as lady alice looked with her cold and steady glance over the congregation in the aisle during the interval of silence that precedes the commencement of the service a tall and graceful young man with an air of semiforeign fashion entered the church accompanied by an elderly gentleman of whom she took comparatively little note the young man and his friend were ushered into a seat confronting the gallery lady alice gazed and gazed transfixed with astonishment and horror the enamelled miniature on her bosom was like but there in that clear melancholy face with its large eyes and wavy hair was a resurrection in that animated sculpture were delicate tracings and touches of natures chisel which the artist had failed to represent which even memory had neglected to fix but which all now returned with the startling sense of identity in a moment she had put on her gold spectacles as she always did on taking her seat and opened her  morning service  bound in purple russia with its golden clasp and long ribbons fringed with the same precious metal with the intent to mark the proper psalms and lessons at her haughty leisure she therefore saw the moving image of her dead son before her with an agonising distinctness that told like a blight of palsy on her face she saw his elderly companion also distinctly a roundshouldered man with his short caped cloak still on a grave man with a large high bald forehead a heavy hooked nose and great hanging moustache and beard a dead and ominous face enough except for the pierceing glance of his full eyes under very thick brows and just the one you would have chosen out of a thousand portraits for a plotting highpriest or an old magician this magician is bent upon punishing sir jekvl for some wrong deed in former years and revealing the mysteries of a dreadful  green chamber which is said to be haunted by a devil we have not space to give an outline of the tale but must refer the reader to the book itself for a satisfactory elucidation of the anguish of poor lady alice at the apparent resuscitation of her dead son guy deverell those who have an appetite for horrors will no doubt enjoy

we do not intend it to convey the idea of an utter failure but rather that mr kingsley will not create such an impression as he has done by preceding compositions the cause of this want of success arises from the story itself and this might be expected when the circumstances under which it was written are well considered mr kingsley says in his preface  the choice of a story was extremely difficult till in consultation one said tell them the story we heard at st malo and of which we have so often spoken since the thing was done from this we can easily deduce that mr kingsley contracted to write a novel that at the time the contract was made he had no plot or story or even any idea of one ready and that thereupon he hunted about and took the first that offered this haphazard method of selecting a subject to work upon did not deserve to succeed nor has it ever succeeded though it appears to be the favourite method of writers of the present day probably because it saves trouble how strange it is that novelists will not understand the vital importance of first choosing a good story and then telling it in their best fashion instead of acting in the manner suggested they seem to sit down to scribble with the very slightest notion of what their narrative is to be and trust to the brightness of their description and power of depicting lively conversations to compensate for deficiencies in the tale to start with it is always a mistake to found a novel upon a true story why this should be the case admits of many explanations but without discussing the reasons for it it is enough for us that it is a fact as is evident when we remember that historical novels have hitherto been failures even sir walter scotts historical novels were very much inferior to his domestic mdlle mathilde is no exception to the rule throughout the work it is obvious that the author is trammelled by his desire to adhere to the true account of his heroines life as much as possible and that relying too much on this cutanddried narrative he has not allowed himself the free exercise of that power of imagination which is one of his best gifts again the tale itself is too meagre and to compensate for this the author has been obliged to thrust prominently forward a lot of uninteresting and useless personages who bore the readerwilliam the silent for example that  this was inevitable appears at once when we riate what mdlle mathildes history really is this heroineand she was truly onein love with a young englishman and by him beloved sacrifices her own life in the french revolution to save her sisters this is the whole story of course it can be and is magnified to a very great extent but still details however well worked out and however numerous will not alter the story to use a poetical illustration in the fashion of mr weller an engraving by the new indiarubber process may be enlarged indefinitely without in any way adding to or diminishing the number and proportions of the lines in the engraving so here pages may be taken up with details of mathildes life in prison of her falling in love of her fathers servants and other like subjects but they only act as an enlargement of the original tale as we have stated it and we repeat that that tale is meagre lastly every one is tired of the french revolution to hear that a young lady was murdered by a citizen mob of the period hardly moves one so accustomed are we to all kinds of scenes of violence and horror at that time by a perusal of numberless histories we wish some author would for a change give us an idea of the brighter side of the revolution every one hitherto has delighted in painting it as black as he can till a sort of hazy idea wrvades englishmen that a good third of france perished by the guillotine or by murder daring the struggle when we consider the comparatively few who really were killed it is evident that the great mass of french people enjoyed themselves much as usual the whole time if a writer will insist on taking up this revolution again we ask him for the sake of novelty to look at it from the point of view here suggested in conclusion we may say that much as we admire mr kingsleys writings we can afford to wait a little longer for his next if he will spend the extra time on the composition of an original and more carefully selected plot,ovel

is cumulativethe method of an infinity of facts and pictorial detail the opposite of turgenevs who relied on selection and concentration on atmosphere and poetic balance tolstoy fills in all the spaces and leaves little to the imagination but with such vigour such fresh ness that it is all interesting his style in the narrow sense is by no means remarkable all his work bears the impress of a mind more concerned with the thing said than with the way to say it but if one may add to interminable definitions style is the power in a writer to remove all barriers between himself and his reader  the t r i u m p h of style is the creation of intimacy then though such a definition will put many out of court it will leave tolstoy a stylist for no author in h i s storytelling produces a more i n

effort to prove that what he himself felt and saw was what the average man could feel and see and in all this long attempt we are conscious of the distortion which comes when an artist and thinker tries to put himself into the skin of the normal man or rather tries to put the normal man into his own skin a useful illustration of such distortion occurs in one of conrads early stories  the return

them from inside in any case the russia of tolstoys great novels  war and peace  and  anna karnina is a russia of the past perhaps only the crust of that russia of the pastnow split and crumbled

B3428,['6869575'],  overshadowed l the shorter poems of frederick tennyson macmillan and co it is probable that few people know the name of frederick tennyson save from the chance connexion of relationship to the great poet laureate for all that he was a poet of no mean ability who but for the eclipsing glory of his brother might conceivably have made a name conspicuous in the history of victorian literature he had unfortunately too retiring a disposition a nature too fond of abstract study and a soul that loved and sought for seclusion such ideals were hardly the right weapons for a fight necessary to make the dense understand the separate identities of his brother and himself and frederick tennyson never tried to do more than please his friends with the poems that were to him one of the easiest methods of expression with no wish for a public reputation the poet did not restrain himself sufficiently ever to get it in his constant use of capitals which to him doubtless conveyed an extra interpretation and significant reality in his vagueness and diffuseness of expression and the frequent antitheses he employed may be traced without especial difficulty the fondness for the abstract that can never make frederick tennyson really popular with any except those who look for poetry to convey to them something beyond a simple story with a moral or a motto and a sweet sense of emotional music frederick tennyson very often does tell a simple story and he very often uses exceedingly sweet lines but in general his style is very different examine a verse from a poem entitled the mountain so from the faroff mount of poesy the worlds great shows like the hushd champaign seem the actual insubstantiality real what is shaped in fancys eager eye fear love a hope a dream it is doubtful if any but real poets will appreciate this stanza with its harshness in places and abstractness of philosophical ideas but there are times when frederick can become as philosophical and as musical as browning take for example these two lines with all the great dreams that lie behind all the possibilities of eternity and all the conceptions that hover behind space climbing into the awful infinite those stairs whose steps are worlds very roughly indeed this is the main trend of ideas that run through this book for we must admit that frequently the theme is monotonous and the poet reiterates in a different manner what he has already expressed it must be understood however that though there are many faults of style and execution in the craft of the poetry yet in itself the poems are those which only one who had soared above the realms of minor poetry could have written,ovel
B8941,['8665899'],  a lifts secret by mrs henry wood 2 vols wood whitten six years since for though pages of a serial this story of love amongst the rich and strikes amongst the poor is now for the first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living novelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a novelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no

which we now find are only a knack but the story is so wildly absurd and improbable the style is so exaggerated and the mixture of scotch gaelic and english so tedious that we lay the book down with two heavy sighs one denotes gratification at having finished it the other regret that a man who once am usd us so well and made us think should now bore us so thoroughly and only succeed in making us yawn sir keith macleod of dare is the son of a mother who strange to say has given birth to four baronets the mystery is explained by the fact that her other sons wrere all killed in succession either in the crimea or by north american indians or on the gold coast or at koniggratz keith though youngest and only surviving one goes to london to enjoy himself and is taken by a friend to the house of a

any wine he becomes intoxicated by the cent of flowers the rosecoloured curtains and the soft wees to which he is introduced he oats asparagus soup for luncheon an 1 the result of this dish taken at so untimely an hour is that he entertains a certain lovely miss vv lute with a multitude of scotch legends for threequarters of an hour in a back room although miss white knows nothing of scotland or

his cousin janette whom his mother was keeping for him at castle dare and his whole object is to make gertrude white his wife this young lady is at first tempted by the prospect of becoming lady macleod but when her sister a precocious damsel of fourteen lectures her on the folly of leaving the stage and sternly opposes the marriage she gives up the idea and turns a cold shoulder on her lover who meanwhile has performed sundry acts of bravery and generosity not the least among the latter is his protection of a small boy who is neglected by his poor parents he takes this boy home to scotland makes a jackofallwork of him and on his return to town calls on johnnys mother to tell her how her son is getting on and after giving her a satisfactory account of him he adds  here is his first quarters wages at the same time munificently handing her the sum of thirteen shillings which lavish generosity of course calls down many blessings on his head major stewart the friend who accompanies our hero on this his second visit to london is decidedly amusing his advice to keith on no account to marry a sigher is good as miss white is obdurate macleod resorts to a stratagem to win her he persuades her to come on board his yacht which is lying in the thames he locks her up in the cabin sets sail and is off to scotland and every one on board seems smitten with silence although gertrude is by no means a willing prisoner and the thames is as full of craft as fleetstreet of carriages he keeps her closely confined till they reach scotland then foreseeing a storm he puts his crew on shore cuts the vessel adrift and is drowned with his beloved in a flash of very forked lightning of course he is quite mad and was probably invented to be a pendant to violet who it will be remembered also became insane from disappointed affection mr black clearly hankers after pairs of novels like other people after pairs of candelabra or pairs of horses but we hope we shall be preserved from another novel to make up the pair with  green pastures and piccadilly a number of the most eminent artists have been called in to illustrate this book and some of the sketches of rock

is represented by mr graham leaning on the parapet of the thames embankment and although st pauls and waterloo bridge are beautiful in the distance macleod is not in the least like what he was at the beginning of the book and when he gets home and kisses hamishs granddaughter his appearance is again entirely altered thanks to a third artist who delineates his features this cooperative principle

dwarfs her own conceptions and disappoints the expectations of her readers by her evident fear of entering the list of the sensationalist but the character of meta belongs of right to that class of

much to their edification but if she wishes to address that wider audience which is called the public she must make her books more human and the first step in that direction would be to make her country rectors men as well as parsons here is an outline of the story mrs beamish is the widow of a country clergyman and not being left particularly well off she agrees that her two daughters gertrude and ethel having finished their education should open a boardingschool in the large house at lindenhurst which the generosity of a friend had enabled them to take with this end in view arrangements had been made with their german cousin meta kauffman for her coming over to england and joining them in the labours of the school the two sisters have not yet finished their own education when they receive a letter from their mother announcing the rather sudden arrival of this german cousin and soliciting the return of one or other of them immediately in order that the stranger in a strange land might not be without a companion this letter rather puzzles the sisters at first but the younger of the two who is the teller of the whole story guesses very properly to this effect  it is simply as it seems to me that meta kauffman has turned out to be a young lady of sufficient personal and mental attractions to make a dangerous 1eteatete companion day after day for our sensitive if not susceptible brother and mamma who is easily frightened catches hold of the first straws that she sees floating towards her in this dire extremity if aleta had only been content to remain in her happy fatherland a few weeks longer guy would have been safe at cambridge and you and i quite free to devote ourselves to the young persons entertainment by the time ethel arrives however the mischief is done and her impressionable brother guy is the adoring slave of the goldenhaired meta the cousin moreover never joins in the school but accepts a situation as governess in a neighbouring family to which she is recommended by mrs arnott a lively young widow whose acquaintance she has converted into a friendship the fascinating manners and wonderful singing of the new governess gain the good opinions of every one and it is even whispered that young edmund hallam heir to the earldom of clinton thinks more of her than he does of alicia clarkson the young lady to whom lhe is engaged in the meantime the two sisters open school with three or four pupils among whom is included little maggie the delicate child of the new rector his visits become frequent and result in his engagement to ethel he is a grave man of middle age superhumanly modest and saintlike in his piety ethels affection for hin is also of the supernal kind she does not so much love as worship him meta kauffmans engagement as governess at the vivians ends abruptly and she returns to the sisters in disgrace it is now that the rev harold wvyke sees her and looking at her for the first time and much to his astonishment he recognises in meta kauffman mrs alan beresford to whose dying husband at heidelberg he had administered the last sacrament some four years ago on discovering the frivolity of her nature he had very soon repented of his marriage and in order that lie might ultimately shake her off he had persuaded her that that marriage was an irregular one and their little boy illegitimate this he told the clergyman when dying and that that same little boy whom he had placed with maiden aunts of his in devonshire was the real heir to the earldom of clinton it was for seducing the

B3594,['8968828'],  sebastian strome if the object of writing novels is to supply readers with amusement then mr julian hawthorne has failed lamentably for a more disagreeable book has scarcely ever been written if its object be to instruct and improve then he has failed still more egregiously for his squinting hero is a slangy selfconscious prig to the end and he paints his melodramatic villain in such very black colours and hates him so cordially himself that the reader is tempted to detest the former and pity the latter only if the authors object be to bring the sensational drama of the old adelphi and the transpontine stage into the quiet study or bright drawingroom has he succeeded perhaps better than even he supposes we can detect in  sebastian strome  many points of likeness to that old friend who used to make beardless youths alternately thrill and shiver and send nervous women into hysterics there is the same delight in describing magnificent parks and gorgeous mansions and the same ignorance of the ways and manners of people who live in them miss denes park consists of three thousand acres of undulating turf studded with trees and is therefore two miles and a quarter in length and in breadth she is seen dimly in the long vista of her drawingroom or the labyrinth of her conservatory where plaintains form a luxuriant shade is the favourite place for secret interviews with her lovers so vast are its recesses yet this lady allows her scotch gardener to reproach her with marrying a person of jewish descent because the jews crucified our saviour and does not think even to herself of the very obvious retort that our saviour was himself one of the chosen nation in mr hawthornes book smokingrooms of clubs are still the abode of wit and humour and the secret  star chambers  above them places where fortunes are habitually won and lost the mere upholstery in sebastians roomsthe very fact that a heavy velvet tortre separated his bedchamber from his parlour would have betrayed to an experienced reader and playgoer that he could not but be a seducer of women and the authors thorough acquaintance with the city and with the ways of jewish firms like fawley and co as well as his exquisite and delicate humour are fully displayed when he makes fawley senior pronounce  gentleman  shentlziman and take ten per cent from his son on a loan of five thousand pounds than which a happier touch more true to nature could not be imagined if however mr hawthorne proves in the above examples how well he knows the ways of landed proprietors clubs and financiers his intimate familiarity with the inner life of a rectory is fairly staggering there is a clergyman in a rural but populous parish who takes an extremely warm interest in a slightly frivolous female member of his flock for no other reason than because he baptised her and this interest is so overpowering that he is with difficulty restrained from making off to london in a snowstorm to search for the erring lamb although on a moderate calculation hie must in the thirty years of his ministration have baptised many thousand infants of the softer sex and would therefore have to cherish equally the memories of that number of ladies married or unmarried in his ample bosom when the young wonman is broutlit to the rectory the worthy old gentlcmian is allowed to remain in the roomn while something is going on during which even husbands are usually excluded  and although the doctor foresees that a new inhabitant is going to  sebastian strome by julian iianrflorne richard bentley and son be ushered into the world he does not think it necessary to urge on the rector the propriety of retiring both hero and villain have of course a mysterious secret that of the former is soon solved but like in all melodramas the eventuallyrighteous though at first distinctlyobjectionable hero retains a power over the villain with which he smites him when the moment has come au this is in the approved surrey style and we can only wonder that so clever a man as sir hawthorne should condescend to it people flock in thousands to musichalls and similar places of entertainment to see acrobats going through all sorts of extraordinary distortions they walk on their hands double themselves up over ropes turn somersaults through rings and tie themselves into knots the attitudes they assume while going through these eccentric and frequently dangerous exercises are not by any means graceful nor do they serve any useful purpose yet they  draw  and elicit thunders of applause sebastian strome reminds us of these feats it is a singular per  formance and an extremely unpleasant one but being nasty and we confess a remarkable display of human ingenuity it is sure to count its readers by thousands for of course the singularity and strength of the book lies not in mr hawthornes acquaintance with the ways of different classes of society of which we have already quoted examples but in the extraordinary incidents and in the undoubtedly powerful descriptions of character possessed of so facile a pen and endowed with so brilliant an imagination it is a thousand pities that he should allow both to run riot if kept in proper bounds he might have produced a book true to real life and nature as it is there are even in this tissue of exaggerations and improbabilities out of which only the most impossible and farfetched coincidences could at last afford an issue many touches betraying the master and showing that mr hawthorne is capable of really good work nothing for instance could be truer and at the same time more pathetic than the scene between mother and son when sebastian tells his mother that he is guilty of the act which she and her husband have been speaking and thinking of with such deep horror her immense confidence in her son is thus destroyed at one blow and she tells him that but a few weeks before she could not have believed herself capable of acknowledging him as her son after such a discovery but when it comes she loves him more than ever and her deep grief does not find vent in a single reproach that an author able to describe the scenes which follow mlr stromes death with so much tenderness and with such a power of analysis of the most delicate recesses of a womans heart should in the exuberance of his strength rush off into the slums of whitechapel should find no better means of getting rid of his characters than a railway accident which kills two and a runaway horse which disposes of another is matter for astonishment and regret of the important personages of this novel no less than four lose their senses at one time or another during the book two onlymrs strome and smillettare apparently sane throughout yet although the latter always speaks as if he were in perfect mental health he acts like a madman in leaving the heroine with her dead husband and rushing off to the crimea without whispering a word to anyone of the terrible scene lhe has witnessed the reason given for this eccentric conduct is absurdly insufficient and the manner in which he sebastian and prout are brought together in the trenches before sebastopol is as improbable as it is forced as in ladies novels there arc always snug government appointments available for meritorious young men and the ease with which strome obtains a  diplomatic  post in the crimea is as remarkable as the diplomatic business he had to transact there is mysterious and though mr hawthorne recklessly discards probability and throws all the ordinary natural rules overboard in order to get his puppets into dramatic situations and cut knots of his own tying he is not careful enough to avoid contradicting himself in the first chapter of vol iii we are told that very few people knew where strome lived and they were not among the number who were likely to attend the sale  while a very few pages further on it is stated that strome was soon beyond the furthest limits of the fashionable world wherein for some years he had cut no inconsiderable figure again we are informed early in the book that miss denes estates were settled on herself and children and that her husband would have no power over them yet she sells them within a few days of his death to pay his debts to a bank of which he himself was tartner the whole book in short shows a fervid imagination and great cleverness but also haste extravagance and a total want of balance we believe that if mr hawthorne had put the ms aside and taken it up again after six months he would have entirely recast his work and would then have produced a really good novel instead of a tissue of impossibilities barely redeemed by the extraordinary talent which marks some chapters,ovel

B62,['9435822'],  which eliall it be a novel new novels 3 vols bent ley if we call this a remarkable novel it is less for what it performs than for what it promises in itself it is rather a series of studies than a finished work of art and the reader will find it a curious study rather than an interesting novel there is indeed nothing singular in its being evidently the first work of a young authoress whose hand is not yet certain and vfho begins by reproducing what has impressed her in life as well as in literature as in raphaels early sketches the pencil seems almost to wander over the paper till it is arrested by an idea the author begins undecidedly reminds us at first of a great many writers who have drawn their inspiration more or less directly from mr dickens and shows throughout the book a partiality for the types discovered by f g trafford but in this there is nothing strange what is peculiar to the book is the skill with which some characters are drawn while a great many others have neither outline nor individuality neither novelty nor nature remarkable too is the incisive cleverness of some sentences and the rarity of its appearance we have marked down some epigrams that would do credit to a practised writer yet they are followed by careless grammatical blunders by slips of the pen and slips of the memory which bear the surest witness to inexperience it is plain to us that the author has drawn for her characters on knowledge limited in range but sure within its own province and has supplied the want which she cannot fail to notice by deductions from the premises found in other novelists if in future she will observe for herself and not make experiments where her own powers fail her she may not have the same ease in filling up her canvas but she will produce a more harmonious picture as an instance of the singular contrast between her two classes of characters we would put old mrs redman by the side of madame de fontarce nothing can be weaker more tedious or more hackneyed than the first and nothing could produce a worse impression than the opening chapter the reader who stumbles on this old hag is not at all unlikely to close the book at once and for ever yet if he perseveres a little he finds an entire change madame de fontarce nee blake de baltyshanahan is not only a new character but is drawn with consummate art her outward appearance and her menage are not new to us but her religious principles her cheap charity her way of living on others and dying for them are sketched to perfection when she writes to mrs redman that she is willing to take charge of the heroine madeline digby how prettily she adds that mrs redman is to assist in the matter of outfit and as mrs redman is a stingy old person she hints  i append this slight stipulation knowing the noble pride of an englishwoman who would not devolve all the natural responsibilities on another i what delicacy there is in her artless suggestions al ont madeline digbys religion to her own director and to the good sisters with whom she places her young kinswoman but the best touch of all is where she is trying to arrange a match for madeline and the affair is aided by the young man seeing his intended i acknowledge says madame de fontarce the inconvenience of having a husband absolutely in love with you it is of course a restraint and delays that settling down to an everyday condition which is so desirable but of course it would not last long and it might throw a good deal of power into your hands how the author who could draw such a character as this can condescend to repeat wornout types such as mrs redman and mrs john and thc okeefehow she can transplant hugh elliott from mrs riddells novels and dudley ashurst from all the romances that have ever boon writtenwould be a mystery to us but for the explanation we find in her youth and newness even the introduction of madame de fontarce shows artistic inexperience there is a poverty in devising links of connexion a french teacher tells madeline digby that she met a lady in france whose eyes resembled madelines and that she presumed on this resemblance to ask if the owners of the eyes were not related then again madeline meets an old gentleman in an omnibus who asks her name starts and leaves her f0000 in the third volume she meets another old gentleman in an omnibus who pays her fare and marries her at the encl of the third volume the example set in this way is taken almost too readily by the other characters who are  polished off in two pagrs but although a  mature writer  would hardly fall into this mistake the repetition of such simple incidents as meetings in an omnibus is still more significant the male personages for whom no original can be assigned are marked by very strong external peculiarities and an utter want of corresponding mental characteristics indeed men dn not come out well in the novel they are either heroes of romance or sheer vulgarities one sentence in the book might be taken as typical of the general run of its characters madeline says of lady rawson and mrs john redman that there is a slight likeness a look a sort of physical resemblance only lady rawson is furnished with one or two items omitted in mrs johnbrains and a heart for instance the comparison is not very good as to the two ladies but it describes the method with which the author constructs the characters with which she is not personally familiar one block serves for a great many but the dresses are different and to one she gives a modicum of heart to another the same modicum of brains to another gifts of singing to another fashionable connexions we do not like to linger on these failings when the success of other parts j is so decided but it is easy to feel the success i and the author will be more benefited by  knowing the faults into which she has fallen  she has bestowed most pains on the character  of madeline digby ana her labour has not  been wasted yet the result is that we have two or three living women in a world of ob  noxious lay figures the girl at school who boasts of her pa being rich why ive seen buy your umbrellas at

the clever conversation alism for which wo have given the author credit the carelessness with which much of the book is written lends an additional grace to these smarter sayings for it leaves us to infer that the author might be really brilliant if she took the trouble the same pains that would avoid such phrases as  a venial barthat would not marry off a jessie moorcroft at p 21 of the second volume and marry her again at p osthat would not turn out simple sentences without either head or tailwould give more polish to writing that is even now commendable and would intensify liveliness into

B1449,"['9427216', '4860853']",  i who is the heir by mortimer collins 3 vols maxwell mr collins has written three clever volumes but something more than clever writing is needed to make a novel we want a consistent story an atmosphere in which people might move and people in whom we might believe nor is the void filled up by brilliant writing and wealth of apt quotationby allusions to every passing event whether secret or notoriousand by pictures of a luxury that would be overpowering if it was not impossible we admit that these are pleasant elements in any kind of work but we nave had so much of them already that we cannot give undiminished praise to their repetition all these strawberry breakfasts and dark dreamy eyes and latin mses worthy of catullus and peaches and pines and crystal bowls of ice and fretted flasks of marvellous vintages are delightful to read about for a time but after all they pall upon us is it so certain that the people who can indulge in such luxuries retain their appetite to the last  are not half of them dyspeptic or blasts or born without a taste and afraid to show the defect mr collins has endowed all his heroes with the capacity of guy livingstone  but the only result is that he reminds us too much of that undesirable type without emulating the wickedness or the blackguardism of mr lawrences men mr collins borrows too much of their marvellous strength and indulgence there is an atmosphere shed over his story as if he was inspired by recollections of those novels just as his sprightly dialogue reminds us of  wheat and tares or  late laurels we are gradually led to the conclusion that we have before us a man of ability wanting to see what he can do by a mixture of two or three styles that have pleased him and have taken with the public the keynote has been struck by mr disraeli who has evidently a great admirer and a loving student in mr mortimer collins perhaps it would have been well if the disciple had not followed his master so faithfully in one of his characteristics the personalities which flavour who is the heir are as little concealed as any of mr disraelis portraitures no one can fail to recognise cheiron and caversham roxham and dalmeida but when mr collins comes to his own immediate circle of acquaintances to men who are not so conspicuous in the great world a the leaders of the two houses he ought to have adopted more disguise young wynyard powys and others of the same age will hardly care to see themselves at mudies except on their own titlepages and the world at large which scarcely knows their titlepages will see that it is kept out of some secret and will resent the superfluous mystery there is an attempt at a story in  who is the heir and though mr collins apologises for not keeping up a mystification like mr wilkie collins or mr sheridan le fanu he does keep one up till an advanced part of the third volume we shall not tell it nor even hint at it as we are pretty well practised in novelreading and have our idea about the legitimate sources of plot in fiction we will only say that some of the mysteries are too absurd and some of the means of detection too simple the abduction of lily luttrel for instance is too great a tax on the readers credulity and the sham claim on the mauleverer estates is too sham to impose on the most credulous the episode of the bagman hearing that a rich widow was staying at a farmhouse and making up his mind that by asking shelter there he would gain her hand is beneath so clearsighted an author as mr collins but story is not his strong point he excels in description and he is felicitous in dialogue we could quote many epigrams from the three volumes light graceful verses happy hits in prose which would make the fortune of a stupid novel mr collins is one of those tories whose political principle is opposition to the rising classes one of those menjrho believe in good blood in chivalry and polish and who would therefore keep down j the young men who have not yet made their proofs of all the three in favour of the older men who have tried to make their proofs and failed yet we ought not to despair of mr collinss conversion his chief hero guy luti trel almost a namesake and more than almost i a reminiscence of guy darrell gives up politics  england and his future because his faith in i toryismhas suddenly been shaken theheroine i who had agreed to be his wife says she must  give him up because she cannot marry any one but a tory  the ashleighs have always been tories and i have always felt as if people who were not tories belonged to some different race and he goes off to africa but his plunge into the desert ocean strengthens him and he comes back to win her convinced that the world has profounder ideas than toryism or whiggery we hope mr collinss plunge into the ocean of novels will have the same effect on him  wkino is the ieir a novel by mortimer collins two vols maxwell  co the principal incidents in this story are so peculiar and arise from such an extraordinary group of characters that to disentangle the web is not easy at the same time these volumes are pleasant reading and for those who derive an agreeable little excitement in turning over of a new page ample gratification is provided the paper being nice and creamy the type clear and the lines abundantly leaded politics poetry and the literary press chancerylane and whitecrossstreet electioneering strategy clever chief constables and prizefighters love romance and fast young ladies all seem as one to mr collins facile pen which passes from one subject to another with an airy but not an original grace that induces a genuine regret that he does not confine his really artistic power of word painting whether of character or scenery in a smaller frame and throw the forces of his knowledge and imagination into the plot of his novel and its consistent development the excuse for this want of unity is that  who is the heir  was served up originally piecemeal in the dudbln university magazine the mauleverers are a peculiar race of men three of whom are presented to the reader in the first chapter hugh the father is a fine vigorous voluptuary of sixty who has been twice married and has a son by each marriage his second wife however having run away from him he is again in love  with a sweet cyclamen of the apennines to see this flower he determines to revisit italy and summonses his two sons from london to mauleverers park to announce his intended journey and the probability that he will never return hugh the younger the elder of the two is forty years of age harry the son of the runaway wife is twentyone all remarkable for their great personal beauty and towering height while there also exists another son a captain adderly whose similarity in every respect to harry causes that young man considerable perplexity the mystery as to the heirship of mauleverer therefore is within this web where it is but

all the refinements of life are nicely sketched they reside at riverdale castle and this lady mr mauleverer wishes one of his sons to marry each has an entanglement of his own which precludes this

forty a stranger would have been puzzled to discover his occupation but woul have instinctively decided that he must be a firstrate man in his way and indeed guy luttrel might have obtained distinction in any pursuit he had chosen politics not however without trying other experiments he had written the best comedy the best satirical poem and the best social novel of the day he was quite a leader of fashion without seeking the position the style of his dress and of his equipages being assiduously copied his income was only about a thousand ayear but he seemed to spend five business

would you have it done witch  asked the earl laughing  how in a plain straightforward way why should a man lose his wits at the most important instant of his life when two people love one another they

gave herself a sudden impetus and spun rapidly round on the cracking ice which encircled a little islet then returning towards him she kissed her glove to him and said yes mr guy luttrel i will and with that she skimmed rapidly away towards where the skaters were more numerous  i wonder if anybody else ever made a proposal on the ice said guy to himself vivian said he as they walked towards the

B4102,['8666945'],  a golden heart a novel nev novels by tom hood 1 3 vols tinsley brothers some two years have elapsed since mr hood publishedcaptain masterss children and now he puts forth a story which is so far superior to either of his two previous novels that we are enabled to congratulate him on a measure of success which as the result of patient and thoughtful preparation for the labour of composition has a moral for those hasty and prolific fabricators of prose fiction who are so eager for fame and riches that they cannot bring themselves to take the steps that are requisite for the attainment of either of them our testimony in favour of  a golden heart must however be given with reserves and qualifications for wrong would be done to the author no less than to many of such persons as are likely to become his readers if we represented that the tale satisfied all the more important requirements of art or was free from flaws and blemishes arising from inadvertence and forgetfulness mr hood has yet to learn how to design a story so that its parts besides being proportionate and harmonious shall seem to have issued from one germ by a process that may bo likened to the growth of trees many of the scenes of the tale do not strike the reader as the necessary or natural consequence of what has gone before but rather as independent pictures for any one of which if it were removed another might be substituted without any loss to though general effect and purpose of the authors work in consequence of this defectiveness of structure on closing the book at though end of the third volume the reader feels as though he had been examining a puzzle of many pieces brought into accurate juxtaposition by mechanical contrivance rather than a work of art in which the multiplicity of the parts should bc altogether put out of sight by the results of their combination moreover some of the separate parts are of inferior workmanship though he is for the most part a skilful and conscientious carpenter mr hood has hung upon hinges some folding doors that are several inches too large for the apertures into which they are meant to fit and occasionally he uses timber that even under the blows of his hammer shows signs of incipient dryrot when at the end of his book he describes his bohemia as peopled by the same persons who breathed its destructive atmosphere at the opening of the tale he is certainly chargeable with forgetfulness as to the length of time covered by his volumes though arrangements of the narrative make it hard to see how the rev augustus eudgeworth who is described as a young man on the occasion of the childrens excursion to epping forest can have worked as a poor curate for fiveandtwenty years before he was appointed to a city living unless smallpox has been very inaccurately described by our medical authorities miss marian carlyle can scarcely have sickened of that malady in the time and way set forth by mr hood concerning the mode by which james trefusis an inventive engineer and the hero of the story was enlightened as to the means by which he ought to rifle his new piece of ordnance we should have entered no protest had not mr hood in his preface defended the incident as reasonable and in accordance with the fitness of things but what would have been no matter worth the trouble of correction had we been permitted to smile at it as a novelists notion of mechanical science changes its complexion when the author instead of cancelling the absurd passage gravely maintains that it is a felicitous illustration of natures habit of instructing human intelli gence that janies trefusis may well have learned how to rifle cannon in a new way by observing the conformation of the interior of a little tube taken from a trumpetshaped flower mr hood insists because  in her vast storehouse the principal  of the archimedean screw was at work ere we groped our way to it and because  the bone of the first bird contained the secret of our tubular bridges the strength of material in a hollow circular form unfortunately for mr hoods argument the tubes of tubular bridges do not illustrate in any way the peculiar strength of  hollow circular forms for the simple reason that they are rectangular if mr hood will take a run this autumn to bangor and make proper use of the advantages attached to residence in the george or other hotel of that agreeable city he will be in a better position to judge how far the secret of robert stephensons tubular structures may be said to have existed in the bone of the first bird that warbled in the groves of eden in the mean time he may ascertain from any sound authority on iron bridges that though the engineers first conception of a tubular bridge was formed on the theory that such a bridge should be a fourcornered tube toe did not give it permanent expression until he had satisfied himself by experiment that circular or elliptical formations would fail for his special purpose through want of strength but in spite of such trips as these and others to which we might draw attention the novel in which they occur is a wholesome vigorous manly story distinguishable from ordinary books of its kind by the power of its descriptions of character and natural scenery and by a fine vein of humour to its account of james trefusiss intercourse with the authorities of the ordnance office an account that owes some of its pungency to the authors familiarity with the actual working of a government officewe pay a high but deserved compliment when we say that it will endure to be compared as a piece of satiric writing with mr dickenss description of the circumlocution clerks very good also are the pictures of those regions of bohemia in which james trefusis is from time to time a sojourner nor is the story upon the whole without title to the merit of originality as that term is understood when it is applied to the creations and devices of a novelist although in respect to some of its leading characters and incidents the narrative bears so strong a resemblance to another work of fiction published five years since that an ungenerous critic would find it easy to establish against mr hood a charge of something near akin to plagiarism in 18c2 messrs chapman  hall published a novel  olive blakes good work the interest of which mainly depended on the diverse fortunes of two sisterstho younger a vain frivolous and beautiful girl the elder no less remarkable for a high sense of duty moral courage and womanlinesswho on the death of their grandfather are left dependent on their own exertions and who soon after the loss of the suffolk home in which their childhood was passed find their way to london where the one sinks or appears to sink to the misery and degradation which are likely to be the fate of a girl of great beauty and weak principle in the sinful capital whilst the other by a strenuous discharge of humble duties preserves her life from stain and under cruel circumstances wins the love of all who come within her influence a chief part of the trial and labour of this good woman is found in her endeavour to seek out in order that she may reclaim her from sin the sister who has gone astray and whom she is led to regard as steeped in wickedness eventually the erring girl is recovered and the elder sister becomes the happy wife of an engineer who knew her in girlhood has watched her hard struggle with poverty and sorrow and after years of assiduous wooing eventually takes her as his bride to church from the hospital where she has laboured as a nurse and teacher of sick children this is the novel of 1862 and that a golden heart is not without resemblance to it may be seen when we say that mr hoods novel principally concerns the fortunes of two such sisters who on the loss of their cornish home in which they have been reared as ladies commence life in london as governessesin which city the vain and lovely girl through her moral infirmity even more than the wickedness of the world sinks into sin and shame and woe hke those in which her counterpart in the novel of 62 falls or is supposed to fall whilst the elder and duteous sister after finding comfort for her woe and victory over adverse fortune in the performance of duty and after seeking for her fallen sister in the haunts of vice eventually marries the engineer james trefusis who knew her in childhood has watched her struggle with poverty and sorrow and after years of assiduous wooing leads her as his bride to church from the schoolhouse in clerkenwell where she has laboured for years j ar as the nurse and teacher of children our pur ta pose in noticing the close resemblance of the i th distinguishing features of these novels is not to i a insinuate that mr hood has made an unfair  to use or any use of an earlier writers work  in very likely he never read the novel published  s in 18g2 to which we allude and most cer h tainly had he read and remembered it he  01 would have had the prudence to abstain from je treading so closely in the steps of his pre ii cursor some months since to give a timely b lesson to novelists overzealous for thc protec  el tion of their works from imaginary plagiarism h we showed how all the leading incidents con  v nected with the pending claim upon the titch fi born baronetcy had been set forth with such i ii minuteness in a novel called  not dead yet  n two years before the claimant to that baronetcy j r made his pretensions known that had the 11 novel been a statement of actual occurrences  s and the claimants case merely a work of fie q tion few critics would have hesitated to assert that the latter was a literal reproduction of the former in the golden heart we have evidence that a novel may be an apparent reproduction of another novel just as a legal claim may to all appearance be a simple restatement of a fictitious story since novelists are students and painters of the same objects it is in the nature of things that prose fiction should from time to time reproduce itself and we can only wish that its repetitions ot itself were always as pleasant and vigorous and full of distinctive ability as mr hoods capital novel,ovel

himself is mr huxleys own kind and what he calls very prettily the congenital novelist  who creates a world of people not with the aim whether monscious or unconscious of illustrating a viw of life but for its own sake he writs if you will for fun though it would probably be more accurate to say dot he writes of necessity in an endeavour to relieve the pressure on his imagination of dte fantasy that haunts him he may be unintellectual and even in a sense unintelligent he may be lamentably deficientas dickens the greatest of them wasin poetic sensibility intellectual curiosity and moral ideas or he may bethough this has nt happened yetas infinite in range as shakespeare himself these endowments re beside the point what distinguishes him from others for the purposes of our definition is that he is the vehicle perhaps eve the victim of an incessant copious creaon now mr hugh walpole is a congenital nvelist his stories his people his world hough they have necessarily a personal clouring from their author bear that unmistkable mark of authenticity the air of king not only spontaneous but selfcreated the story of rogue herries is probably the ricst as well as the longest of mr walpoles novels it has movement colour humour and drama it is robust and fullmooded and it has the true flavour of its pjriod which is the eighteenthcentury it tains many scenes that linger in the nmeory the chinese fair where herries dls  by auction his too importunate msress davids assertion of his manhood hn threatened for the last time as it provm with his fathers whip the duel beteen herries and osbaldistone the death of margaret herries who dies in the oldfashioned conversational manner wet movingly the witchbaiting and many ither and smaller things the most and best of these memorable episodes occur in the first of the books four parts mr walpole is perhaps at his best in a scene of bustling good cheer such as the christmas feast at  statesman peels  it was a scene of brilliant colour with the blazing fire the red berries of the holly glowing in every corner old johnny shoestring in bright blue breeches and with silver buckles to his shoes perched on a high stool fiddling for his life the brass gleaming faces shining the stamp of the shoon the screaming of the fiddle the clapclap of the hands as the turns were made in the danceand beyond the heat and the light the dark form of the valley lying in breathless stillness its face stroked by the fall of lingering reluctant snow mr walpole has indeed all the gifts of the born novelist he has also some of the faults that are commonly found in a too facile writer perhaps it is mere idiosyncrasy on my part that makes me impatient with his frequent lapses into short and scrappy paragraphs perhaps i am wrong in thinking that it is a storytellers business to coordinate his information before presenting it to the reader and that he should not rely too much on the bellmans maxim  what i tell you three times is true mr walpole can write when he chooses as well as the next man and often a great deal better his prose is sensitive as well as vigorous and his vision is acute as well as tolerant but above all his fertility in the creation of characters the prime business of your congenital novelist and the skill with which he sets them moving together must be the despair of many a more painstaking writer yet there is something lacking here is a long book romantic copiously eventful full of life but one rises from it without that sense of a profound and satisfying experience which great fiction induces it is as if the author had taken with both hands what comes to him so easily scattered it over his page and never troubled to demand of himself that last degree of concentration that makes all the differenc for this reason or for another it lu intimacy in davids flight with sa for example the dramatic tension of a admirable if conventional situation is destroyed by a kind of chattiness the autho breaking in to tell us that on this very spot in a later century a descendant of these two lovers would conduct quite another sort of wooing elsewhere he adopts too often the tiresome device of telling us that soandso was  always to remember  this or that these things serve only to destroy the illusion by reminding us that we are reading a st they release us from the persuasion that we are sharing an immediate present experience the life of herrics begins for us at thirty and ends half a century later he is shown as an implacable dreamer tormented by a vision of perfection that is symbolised for him in the fantasy of a white horse of incomparable beauty swim ming a lake and climbing a hillside to triumph disappointed in his quest for this ultimate harmony the mystic consummation of all desire he lives wilfully shut away in himself and those who know him only by his outward conduct judge him a rogue and worse suffering from a kind of frustrated nobility he is often cruel ad arrogant and always lonely he loves no one but his son david until in his middle forties he chances upon a young girl called mirabell in whom he at once recognises his hearts desire unfortunately i find it next to impossible to believe in this youg woman or in herries love for her for me she is a figment of pure romantic fancy an apparition the projection of a dream and the authors persuasion dta she is as good flesh and blood as the mg of his people casts a shadow of unrealiy over the latter part of a delightful ad heartwarming and yet exasperating boo i gelw bullm  mew ltovels rogue herries mr hugh walpoles new novel  rogue herries is set in the eighteenth century and is a remarkable study of a man francis herries is a rogue a waster a libertine and yet a gentleman such a man as has been dear to a hundred and one women novelists but no woman novelist could have drawn this man so convincingly so accurately with such masterly and artistic detachment with so clear an insight into his muddied and struggling spirituality i do not know whether it is mnr walpoles masterpiece perhaps i am not far enough from its first reading to judge properly as to that but i do not think it will ever rank among his lesser achievements it seems to me to be a major booknot only for mr walpole but for any writer it is more too than the stuii of a man it is the study of a family of a period of a whole district of england its setting the lake country is quite as important as its events and the coloured spaciousness of his descriptions has a value that is subtly dramatic perhaps more dramatic in essence than many of the apparently more dramatic moments in the plot mr walpole does not write like a poethe is too accomplished a technician to write sentences that might be mistaken for  poetic prose  vet there is something of a poetic sweep of a poetic creativeness about this long mellow and wholly coherent book from the first moment when we see herries in the inn at keswick we are conscious of the truth of his presentation as a psychological study the man is alive from his first entrance and mr walpole has a felicitous power of making his characters betray themselves in their insignificant actions as much as in their larger it is by our trivialities that we are known and the cumulative effect of a characters trivialities is the real triumph in his creation herriess wearing of his rich clothes to meet his pompous brother is a revelation all the more sure because it is not thrust at us but insinuated to us without undue comment at the moment and without analysis beyond its own open fact yet how significant it is of the rebel  the book as well as being a fulllength portrait of one man is a whole gallery of portraits some of them sketches of people in a particular moment others of people growing developing and reacting through a whole series of moments it is impossible in a reviews short space to give a proper idea of the variety of men and women who are painted in this book the whole herries family seems to be living before us when certain members of it are entirely in the background we are yet conscious that they are still living and going about their daily rounds somewhere outside the book covers and we wait for this or that member to reappear produce his or her reactions and show the family characteristics coming out with almost the sureness of fate perhaps the family was to the herries fate there are many studies of child life and these are as profound as they are exquisite the study of the son of e  rogue herries by hlugh walpole ios 6d macmillan mr iugh walpole osing for his bust to mr david evans rbs rogue herries david is as masterly as that of the father yet a little less interesting because he was himself a little less interesting but we are able to watch the father and the son diverging and yet never separating we can appreciate the antagonism in temper which never becomes an antagonism in appreciation both are men rarely has the almost feminine jealousy of a father been more finely described than in the chapter entitled  the seafather and son the emotion is so masculine there is sentiment but no sentimentality and at the back of it there is something so virily wilful both are menfor indeed it is at that moment that the young herries comes into his manhood the women are no less admirable the wife of herries so truly feminine in her lack of intuition rather than in her possession of it the daughter deborah subtle in her very subduedness and most of all mirabell starr there is a touch of goethes mignon in mirabell she has not the poetry of mignon but she has something of her peculiar apartness as if she were a being not perhaps of some other world but of some other manner of inner life it is not often that characterisations so primitively simple are so symbolical too i find looking back on the book that nearly all my impressions of it are either of the people in it or of the country in which it is set and i wonder whether that was mr walpoles intention scenes of drama and outside event in the book are neither few nor far between yet it is the people i remember first and the happenings afterwards but as i think again certain chapters do leap out with intensities of their own the death of the wife of herries the funeral of greataunt mariawith its extraordinary little study of the dog the pitiful drowning of mrs wilson the witch these undoubtedly are at the very height of modern fiction and i am far more tempted into byways of appreciation than along the high road of direct criticism if i may be allowed to remember that i am supposed to be  reviewing  this book i will venture one point of criticism though i feel ungrateful in doing so there is little humour but there is a wealth of quiet irony mr walpole does not repeat himself and this period novelthe fortyfive occurs in the middle of ithas a genuine freshness of inspiration at the same time its psychological wisdom is too penetrative and true for it to have the false freshness of romance it is a serious study of life a mature studv and a work of art wallace b nichols,ovel

or three sermons two or three situations of sentiment and no less than halfadozen marriages to wind up but it is time to allow our readers to judge of the style in which the three volumes are written we pass over the election and several passable touches of humour to extract a narrative of citizen norths journey when endeavouring to evade the pursuit of the officer sent after him on a charge of high treason our author is fond of comparisons and the following with which he opens the 15th chapter is perhaps worth perusingas we leave mfiss north in very good company and in perfect safety we trust our readers notwithstanding their gallantry and the superior interest which they take in the fair sex will not reluctantly attend us in pursuing the course of the patriot for on the fate of patriots what great events depend and on their destiny what momentous concerns do hang  we have always thought it a great defect or rather redundancy in mr addisons tragedy of cato that hie diverts our attention fromn the patriot to entertain us with a lovetale and a scene or two of touching tenderness and somehow or other it so halplpens that this tenderness is not very touchingr and the whole play grows grievously flat although  the virtuous marcia towers above her sex the plain fact is that our symipathy with a lying patriot is so different from our sympathy with a lovesick swain or a sentimental damsel that the emotions are mutually destructive of each other so then although mnr addison has depicted both emotions with such exquisite pathos and so very unartificially inasmuch as that one is by itself enough to break our hearts yet when they both come together in one short drama they destroy the effect they would have produced singly and those matters which would have made two very tolching plavs now make one whiich is untouching wid intouclwd far ho1wever very far be it from our thoughts or wishes to insinuate by these expressions that it is our intention to leave miss north totally unprovided with any means or materials of sympathy and tenderness we are not writing a drama which must be grasped by one eftort of mind but a narrative through vwhich the reader may advance witl consideration and coolness but wve are cauti ous of so arranging its parts as that the pathos of sentiment should unduly iiiteiicre with the emotions of patriotism our patriot too is superior to cato for the rtomran only died for his country and then he could be of no farther usc but mr north took care to live for his country and wvas very much at ier service whlen needed so that this superiority in the patriots character can spare room for a little leaven of tenderness and love and after all what if the patriot hjimnself should be affected with the tender passion it is not impossible by the way what a pity it is that mr addison did not make cato himnself fall in love that wvould have increased the interest of his play very considerably but to proceed at two oclock p m m1r north alias mr west took his seat in what was then called the liverpool postcoach it was well for him that charles slender had secured him a place in good timne for he was the last of six who filled the inside isis fellow travellers wvere three elderly ladies and two elderly gentlemen all of whom did most graciously interchange salutations with the patriot one of the gentlemen had somewhat the look of a clergyman and the other might pass for a liverpool merchant the ladies seemed to be strangers to one another and to the rest of the company they did not however appear uisociably disposed for they looked one at another and then at the gentlemen and then out of the coachwindow as if for somethillng to talk about when tlley arrived at jslingyton one of them said it is a cool afternoon and another said very and the third pulled up one of the wnindowvs then the gentleman in brown who looked like a merchant said to the gentleman in black who looked like a clergyman have you heard of the plot  plot what plot  said the other and so said also the three ladies all at once you dont say so continued one of the ladies  when anld where  and is it discocovered  la ine  all that comes of liberty andl nonsense wsell for my part i wish there had never been such a thing thought of as liberty but pray sir can you tell us anything about the plot  was it to blow up the king and parliaaen  house  yes madam said the gcntleman in brown  i have it lhere all in black and w1hite thereupon he drew from his pocket a morningrr papler and as lhe unfolded the paper the ladies kept uttering exclamations shocking horrible dreadful terrible and they lookecl as if they expected that they should be all loqwnl up as soon as the paper was fairly unfolded it was some time before the communicative gentleman could so arrange the paper as to be able to read it aloud for the road from ilington to highgate was in most niserable plighlt thirty years ago 5lt length all5s thle stare

ptions fronm ruts and stones and from a ticklingr in jthe throat which the old cnentleman said lhe was always troubled with when he read aloud finding that this irritation in the throat rather increasej than abated he turned round to mr north sand said 1 perhlaps this gentleman will have the goodness to read it for me  the patriot bowedl and was going to say  with pleasure iie only said  by all nicoms sir and forthwith he proceeded to read  the coacih had by this timne reached the summit of the hill and due refreshment had been administered by thle coachman to himself and his horses as mr north proceeded in his readinn which was now not easily heard on account of the increased noise of the coach from its more rapid progress he perceived that he had possession not of the paper which had graced his own breakfasttable but of a second edition of a ministerial or government paper in which was a lescription and a rewvard offered for the apprehension of stephen barddolph northl now it did appear quite supeif11uous to read aloud to his company a description of a person whom they had before theem hiolding therefore his head and the paper nearer to the window as if for the purpose of gaiing more lit lhe very cleverly contrived to let the paper fall into the road bless me said the patriot  how unfortunate  shall i stop the coach   whats the matter  said the merchant who wvas half asleep i have had the misfortune to drop your paper sir shall i call the coachman  the merchant immediately put his head out at the coach window and was attempting at tha hisighest pitch of his voice to say coachman but lhe could only say  coach and that very feebly for the tickling in his throat came on agrain and he begran to cough so iriteanperately that mr north in his concern for the poor old gentleman forgot to socond his crv for the coach to stop and before i the fit of cougrhingr was quite over and the patient restored to the calmn use of his organs of speech and respiration the coach was far past the spot where the paper had fallen mr north had nothincg to do but to apologize and the merchant had nothing to do but to accet his apologies and to beg that no more might be said about it for i believe continued he  that i you had read all that was material except perhaps the description of the person of one of thie principal conspirators  and that does not much signify for we are

preliminary sketch of the two families the wylders and the brandons is an excellent introduction to a dark and shadowy story there were wylders of brandon and brandons of brandon in one generation a wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the brandons the next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto the estates were back again with the wylders a statement of title is usually a dry affair but that of the dynasty of brandon hall was a truculent romance this strong bad handsome halfinsane halfdiabolical race who must have descended in aright line from cain

which ought to have brought him to the gallows if it had not made his fortune he tyrannises over his sister who is the only character quite free from the evil taint that runs in the three families she is however a victim to it there is some secret of rascality between stanley lake and mark wyldera secret which apparently makes mark dread his cousin as well as detest him they go out together one night though week before the marriage and mark wylder never returns letters are received from him speaking mysteriously of his affairs and of some old scrape the consequences of which have obliged him to go suddenly abroad he sets his betrothed bride free from her engagement and letters on business continue to be received written by him from different continental towns giving directions about his property and speaking of his return the lawyer to whom his letters are chiefly addressed has a great deal to do in the story but his part is far too longall his chicaneries and attempts to overreach poor william wylder marks brother are wearisome and occupy the space needed for the dinohment some time after the departure of mark wylder dorcas brandon marries stanley lake the reader has been prepared for this exchangetho reader knows what a scoundrel he is without heart or conscience but dorcas brandon does not know it she is infatuated about him had determined to renounce her engagement to mark if mark himself had not saved her the trouble but stanley lake has difficulties and mysteries of his own in which he has involved his sister rachel and a dark terrible mystery gathers over the whole house of brandon there aro some touches of imagination which though they have nothing absolutely to do with the story heighten the interest and are extremely effective tamar the old nurse and though spectral figure of uncle lorn are powerful sketches though descriptions of places too are so well managed that rocks trees pathways ami even the very furniture of certain rooms add to the weird ghostly awe inspired by the dark nameless crime that haunts the story gradually gathering distinctness and becoming palpable until in the end it stands revealed and confessed as we have said the dinohmcnt is not sufficiently worked out but it has substance enough to justify though preparation mr le fanu shows qualities that ought to enable him to write even better novels than the present his style is forcible and brilliant and his faculty for graphic description sometimes leads him to bestow too much time and minute delineation on secondary characters lawyer larkins and his rascalities are followed at far too great a length  the reader does not caro to be diverted from the main stream of the interest but  wylders hand is a remarkable story ami we recommend our readers to get it for themselves,ovel
