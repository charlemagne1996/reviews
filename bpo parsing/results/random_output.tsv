B2546,"['8774297', '8943685', '3211357']",  the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity  the works of george meredith memorial edition vols ivl constable  co this memorial edition of merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use for the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciation  the works of george meredith 17 vols 6s each constable to fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  standard edition  of merediths works except the price the paper is good the type clear and of a comfortable size and the books tastefully bound in blue cloth with gilt tops eight of the volumes have been issued the two latest being  harry richmond  and  beauchamps career the poetical works are issued in uniform style for an extra halfcrown so that in eighteen volumes at a total cpst of about five pounds one rtay now possess the whole of merediths writings his greatness as novelist and poet are no longer in question his place in our literature is secure certain of his admirers have injured his popularity by exaggerating the difficulties of his style but that talk is dying down arid the new generation of readers is suspecting that it reflected rather on the limitationl oqf those admirers than on the art

B7585,['6637042'],  malay sketches by frank athelstane swettenham john lane mr swettenham tells us in the preface to his informing sketchbook that he has aspired and aspired solely  to awaken an interest in an almost undescribed but deeply interesting peoplethe dwellers in one of the most beautiful and least known countries in the east he disclaims any intention of writing a book of travels in the ordinary sense and has aimed at presenting malay character faithfully without embellishment and without adventitious colouring it may be said that he has succeeded admirably in his undertaking so that although his sketches are not exactly tales they are as full of interest as the best of short stories could possibly be it is true they are not of equal merit sometimes the author displays the prentice hand  as in one of the largest of the sketches  the passing of penglima prang semacen which is decidedly prosy and involved though valuable as supplying evidence of malay character in which regard it is quite as worthy of our respect as any of the rest indeed apart from their artistic worth the volume is to be heartily commended because it is destined to prove a trustworthy record of malay life and character when the destructive influences of western civilisation shall have obliterated the distinctive features of the race as touching this contingency mr swettenham writes feelingly malaya he says raising his voicea prophetically land of the pirate and the amok your secrets have been well guarded but the enemy has at last passed your gate and soon the irresistible juggernaut of progress will have penetrated to your remotest fastness slain your beasts cut down your forests  civilised your people clothed them in strange garments and stamped them with the seal of a higher morality mr swettenhams first sketch deals with the  real malay and an extremely realistic picture it is in some of his qualities it seems that he resembles the englishman who will recognise kindred spirits in a nation fond of gambling cockfighting and fieldsports he is by nature a sportsman and is thoroughly at home in a boat on the other hand he differs widely from the english race in that he never drinks intoxicants he is a muhammadan and a fatalist but he is also very superstitious mr swettenham describes graphically that peculiar form of homicidal mania called by us  running amuck common to most eastern peoples but of especial frequency among the malays but mengamok idiosyncratic though it be is not so abnormal a development as the strange disease of frequent occurrence among the malays called latah it appears that no english authority has attempted to diagnose this uncanny complaint or to attempt its cure we must commend its victims to lombroso nordau and the alienists generally for it would seem to have its origin in nervous and cerebral degeneration the author cites many instances of this peculiar malady and in regard to two men affected by it he says that it was only necessary to attract their attention by some simple means to look them hard in the face when they instantly lost all control of themselves and would do not only whatever they were told to do but whatever was suggested by a sign  the eternal feminine  treats of a woman faithful to her spouse a white man unto death we are made to feel that this woman was exceptional rather than typical which was exactly what the writer intended us to understand it is an admirable little tale in the next in the noon of night mr swettenhams powers as a descriptive writer are fully demonstrated in this as in many of the sketches we are presented with pictures full of suggestive beauty and ripe with knowledge of the country described they charm us and rivet our attention one is tempted to quote to substantiate the statement this tale has also fine dramatic qualities though it is a pity mr swettenham should descend into cheap philosophising little short of drivel as he brings the sketch to a close there is again some delightful descriptive writing in  bez hautu where the author dallies lovingly with  the exquisite feathery fronds of the bamboo with the orchards ricefields and glistening rivers fading into mistenshrouded forest he is no less felicitous in drawing for us portraits of the malay boy  a thing of wonderful eyes eyelashes and eyebrows with a faraway expression of sadness and solemnity as though he had left some better place for a compulsory exile on earth and of the malay girl proud of a wealth of straight black hair of a spotless olive complexion of the circle of her browlike a onedayold moonof the curl of her eyelashes and of the dimples in cheek or chin admirable descriptions of tiger hunts fishing picnics and other native functions  and institutions conspire to

george moore and which declares itselfin more ominous shapein the freakishness of mr bernard shaw the politician that note of inspired inefficiency is rather too prevalent here readable of course like everything irish butwell these angels of mr stephens have not much backbone they are too much given to mooning about in a mist of symbolism that makes one yearn for some stray piercing gleam from la rivolte des anges the volume is short at all events and would be shorter still but for a few intercalated stories some jolly little conversations about nothing in particular and certain remarks on matters artistic and otherwise which impair its tonaliti and produce a queer patchwork effect on the readers mind the earthly personages are more convincing they prove what everybody knows namely that when an irishman condescends to restrain his temperamental animism and discourse of affairs terrestrial he can be as entertaining as ever you please the tinker is especially good he covers a multitude of sins lastly there is a donkey an everpresent donkeya kind of golden thread running through the book from cover to cover it is a very ancient mirthprovoking device this of the donkey but one which like the policeman in the pantomime never fails in its effect what is it that makes this amiable quadruped so irresistibly funny one has only to mention the humble ass and everyone is convulsed with laughter at least he knows perfectly well he ought to be why biblical associations  fiotion the demigods by james stephens macmillan  co 5s net there is a tribe in literature who may be called though dazzlers or the awakeners according as one views its members with qualified or unqualified admiration the main point about these writers is that they are secure from the mortification of seeing their works fall flat their style and matter are clamant and arresting or brilliant and fascinating they produce psychic effects comparable with those produced by new lands in calling them collectively a tribe we offend for the sake of convenience against linguistic propriety for it is impossible to imagine a marching procession of dazzlers  the glory of each is partly conditional on his distinctness from the rest mr stephens is surely one of the most remarkable of living literary dazzlers  he has indeed a right to be called an awakener for he makes the reader sleeping the drugged sleep of caste and property awake in a world of new values the queerly composed fantasy before us is circumstantially more improbable than a fairy tale and has that superabundance of rhetoric which is unfortunately characteristic of irish earnestness  but the authors imaginative power compels his characters to stand out human idiosyncratic and alive  unharmed by their creators errors an irish wandering thief his daughter an ass a woman of many loves and three angels these are the principal characters the angels with their removable wings and businesslike mouths and appetites at first sight seem to have less reality of existence than leprechauns  but a real spiritual dignity becomes manifest in the course of their earthly visit they become instruments of revaluation  the ass whom the girl fondles and the thief illtreats does not make the archangel ridiculous by being somewhat like him  nor does the resemblance between the archangel and an inveterate  light woman  serve to disprove the formers celestial nature and functions similarly though the angels live on food stolen for them the authors art keeps them from the taint of dishonesty and obliges the reader to look at the origin and spiritual aspect of property and acquisitiveness mr stephens retains despite the play of his paradoxical humour the idea that angels are essentially more than human though his rhadamanthine comedy of a threepenny bit lost by one of the damned and improperly appropriated by a seraph is as clamantly farcical as anything in lever he does not ignore the fact that humour is only one of the admirable moods in which the human may consider the superterrestrial and angelic  there is nothing in thc world could stand against one of us says cacltia the seraph in this story  and before art the cherub destroys his wings to symbolise his devotion to one wingless girl the author has taken care to low that hisyonderfulness is not depdmktirijigs or any other machine perhaps the peculiar attraction of this book can be best defined as a harmony between the sublime and the ridiculous the esoteric and the simple  what would the priest say asks patsy the tramp if he heard we were stravaiging the country with three big buck angels and they full of tricks may be   it is safe to say that patsys phrasing would arouse in a gentleman prepared to hear his story an expectation of horrors of vulgarity how extraordinary would bo that gentlemans disappointment here we have a tenderness worthy of francis of assisi a drollery and topsyturviness as of irish fairies flashes of indian mysticism and primitive brutality poetic prose as artificial as a song and a barbarians dialect it is a book of obstinate liveliness and charm,dom

B3641,"['6670816', '8986856', '3278414']",  the ms in a red box lane 6s tue mystery of the ms of this story has been so much exploited that we need not refer to it further here save to pay that the book itself comes rather as an anticlimax for though it is a pleasant and reasonably interesting book it is no better than dozens of volumes which have appeared during say the past three years the author has a faculty for narrative sufficient invention and enough knowledge of his period to carry the thing through  in a word he is a good mechanic but there is no characterisation in the story the hero is the very type of the conventional hero and the three villains are very types of the conventional villain the hero sails triumphantly through all dangers to happiness and the lady and the villains come by their deserts there are a good many minor characters but they come in merely as accessories indeed the experienced reader can tell at once just why they make their appearance but all this is not to say that the book is not goed of its kind the setting is careful and accurate and the conflict between the folks of axholme and the dutch engineer vermuijden who had charles the firsts authority to drain and embank the isle is vigorously described the manner of the book smacks rather of wardour street purely modern phrasing and almost slang clash unpleasantly with an artificial archaism but here again the author merely sins with most of those secondclass writers of romance with whom at present he must be classed yet the story has promise and a kind of ease and briskness which experience may turn to good account and at least the book is wholesome and manly and cleanblooded  the ms in a red box lane the author of this romance has had the good fortune to hit upon a period in history which has not been hackneyed by general use we remember no other novel in which the draining of the fens by dutchmen under charles i is the mainspring of the plot it is well known that this improvement roused the fierce hostility of the people of the fens and it is that hostility which the author employs in his stirring narrative thus the tale has this to the good that it has a natural colour particular to it and is in consequence of somewhat a different shape from the multitude of romances technically termed  historical unhappily the characterization has little to distinguish it from the ruck of such performances the hero frank vavasour is the usual brave and reckless young fellow in love with a fair maiden as is habitual with such tales the hero is so headstrong as to run into every danger that a man with a grain of common sense would have avoided as is also usual he tells his own tale very modestly of course and sings the praises of his ladylove not so modestlyas is natural and the two chief villains are exactly what we looked forthe one dutch and the other an english nobleman they are blackened to a hair and could not be whitewashed by the most ingenious perverter of history but of a truth they glory in their shame and are calculated to fill unsophisticated minds with the most passionate feelings of revenge for the colours are all primitive and the drawing is with crayons not that that matters in this style of book it is sufficient that there should be plenty of incident which there is and that the narrative should amble briskly which it does the writing too is of quite a spirited order so that there is little wanting to make a good book of adventure rather above the average and possibly the earnest of better work by its anonymous author  the ms in a red box 6s lane mysterious and ingenious rumours and advertisements had raised our expectations to such a height that  the nis in a red box must hai e been a very e xt raord r in a ry book inceed if it had come ip to them it is not a lery extraordinary book but it is distinctly good and if it had not been so overshadowed by its antenatal reputation it would have seemed even better it is a brisk capable romance of the accepted latterday patterr laid in the lincolinsiire fen country in the reign of charles i  it has the usual fearless but somewhat slowwitted hero who plunges into a fresh peril every time lie goes out of doors is f r e q u e n t i y wounded and once left for eead but always comes through triumphantly the usual faitlful retainer the usual lovely much persecuted heroine the usual dashing villain whose schemes to kidnap her invariably fail at the right moment the usual crop of glaring coincidences and the usual happy end but some of the

and co thoroughly genuine and unaffected these memoirs display the whole mind of a woman who was well worth knowing and relate a large part of her experience among people with whose names and characters the world will be at all times busy a true woman and a keen observer indoctrinated in all the prepossessions of the old nobility yet superior to most of its prejudices in the secret comers of her heart a little superstitious not at all exempt from little vanities and weaknesses that rather grace her sex firmly affectionate in nature and by position thrown in the high places of the world the countess doberkirchlanele as her bosom friends tenderly called herwas the very woman to write memoirs that would interest future generations we commend the volumes before us most heartily to every reader they were written by the baroness in the bloom of her own life and health and though they narrate many experiences of life in a corrupt court everything comes to us on her pages through a mind so pure and true that we are never shocked while at the same time the whole narration is so fresh a transcript of what seemed most interesting in the writers own experience that we are never wearied that is to say of course if we skip all the pedigrees the baroness esteems birth very highly  and when she speaks of any one for the first time if he should happen to have a father and a grandfather she thinks it due to state the fact and mention who they are all this however adds to the character and charm of the whole book the baroness does not mystify herself her weak sides are patent enough but they are pleasant little weaknesses belonging to her period and to the station that she held in her first chapter she frankly says i may perhaps have lingered a little too long over these accounts of my family but i do not regret it in the first place i wished it to be distinctly known from what race i have sprung i feel it to be a conscientious obligation and besides i find a pleasure in relating these particulars i have the weakness if it be one to esteem what the heroes of the present day call trifles and i ask in my future soninlaw if providence should tend me one in the midst of the chaos which surrounds us and which seems about to swallow up ali social order i ask i tay in my soninlaw only high birth there it a remedy for every defect but the want of that at the same time there ara aoattered through her book little expressions of fatigue over the ceremonials of courts of intense enjoyment of the ease of nature of a love of flowers and of other things which show how

more children i was so surprised that i looked round rae not supposing it possible that he could have the audacity to address a lady of my rana in such a place and such a presence i thought he was sneaking td somebody else and did not answer  reply madam said the cardinal with a supplicating air u my lord madame doberkirch speaks upon such subjects only with those with whom she has the honour of being acquainted replied my husband in a tone that was almost impertinent i feared thal he might forget the respect due to the bishop he rose nnd made a haughty salute i did the same the cardinal accustomed to find flatterers in all who approached him was embarrassed  he did not know what to do  however he drew near to m doberkirch cagliostro still staring at nie and addressed him in wordi so soothing that it was impossible to resist their influence  m de cagliostro is a learned man  we must not treat him as an ordinary person added he  remain a few moments my dear baron allow madame

man arni that nothing but the fear of annoying m doberkirch whose aversion for all these mummeries i knew well could prevent me the cardinal stared openmouthed he was evidently under the control of this skilful juggler as he has since too well proved that day will remain for ever engraven on my memory it was with difficulty that i tore myself from a fascnation which 1 cannot yet comprehend but whose influence i could not deny 1 have not yet finished with cagliostro and what i am about to relate is at least as extraordinary and more generally known than what 1 have narrated he predicted the death of the empress maria theresa and even foretold the hour at which she should expire m de rohan told it to me in the evening aud it was five days after that the news arrived in looking over these pages for a few selections that will illustrate our good opinion we are bewildered among riches they are a perfect magazine of pleasant anecdotes and interesting characteristic things the baroness in her youth became a house friend in the little court of montbeliard from which proceeded the wife of the unfortunate grand duke paul the heirapparent to the throne of russia the future grand duchess was the bosom friend of the baroness and the more than sisterly affection was retained by them both until the last paul and his warmhearted beautiful wife travelled from russia under the names of count and countess du nord and remained some time in paris whither the baroness doberkirch was taken by her husband that she might rejoin her friend life in alsatia at strasburg and montbeliard is therefore succeeded by a chronicle of life among the court circles the poets and philosophers the balls and theatres of paris in 1762 afterwards there is a further account of residence in paris during the years 84 and 86 when the authoress was taken thither by the duchess do bourbon the amiable grand duke paul and his wife are in these memoirs depicted with a completeness that imparts extreme valma

relation which exba between the temper the sentiments of the soul and the features of the human countenance he had been at btupee the previous autumn and ray friends had spoken to him of me in a most flattering manner here is the letter dare i am i to speak as an acquaintance or as a stranger ask yea a favour and a benefit excellent countess  all good people are connected by invisible and

interapsmd  with pedigrees that will be found extremely edifying we will omit however as we have not space for them the verses of the poet in honour of the occasion a marriage took place in that october of thit year which was considered a legitimate subject of conversation for everybody the prince of nassau saarbruk married his son who waa only twelve to mademoiselle de montbarrey who waa eighteen years of age bverybedy was astonished at this alliance not because he waa protestant and she catholic for mixed marriages were very common in that country but because of the age of the prince the young princess wat to return to her parents immediately after tnt ceremony and to remain with them until her husband should be of age mademoiselle de montbarrey ia daughter to the ancient warminister tnt count de st germain had appointed him his assistant in this office in which he succeeded him as he was very clever he profited largely by hie position he was created prince of the holy roman empire grandee of spain knight of the order and grand baillie of haguenau hie wife had been n great beauty she had a most exquisite complexion pearly teeth a captivating smile soft dovelike eyes and caressing mannerall of which made her one of the most charruing persona in the world she haa been accused of having had a too tender heart but she waa beloved and has enjoyed with taste and grace the position of her husband this marriage of the prince de nanausaarbruk with mademoiselle de montbarrey waa a very grand affair the comte de saarbruk as well as that of saarwerden was ceded to france with a number of j dependent lands and lordships in 1681 by an article of the trenry of westphalia to indemnify the ouiit de naeaausaarbruk the emperor by letters patent raised him 4th of august 1688 to the rank of prince of the holy roman bmpire the bridal pair received congratulations and compliments in every possible form i have preserved a copy of some verses addretsed to the princes by a drawingroom poet and which were read with great j avidity during the bridal festivities these verses are very stupid  but i quote them because tbty amused us exceedingly when we considered that this husband  possessor of your charms and who  to loves enchanting bliss shall wake was a child of twelve years of age who wept from morning to night frantic at being made an object of universal curiosity flying from his wife and even repulsing her with the rudeness of aa illbred child and having no desire to claim a title whose signification he did not understand mademoiselle de montbarrey belied ber ordinary good taste in making a display of these verses it would have been better to conceal them m de dietrich who had purchased in 1761 the seigniory of reis boffen near haynenau had the castle rebuilt in 69 thia was confiscated property of the prince de vauderaont and bore the name of an ancient family of alsace now extinct the reigning prince of nassau saarbruk gave brilliant fetes in this

magnificence the hunts feasts and promenades lasted three daya m doberkirch and i were present i met several persons of ray acquaintance both french and i german during the ball the bridegroom would on no account consent to dance with the bride he was at length threatened with a whipping in case of further refusal and promised a deluge of sugarplums and all sorts of sweetmeats if he complied  whereupon he consented to lead her through a minuet though ht showed so great an aversion to her who had a legal claim upon his attentions he manifested a great sympathy for little louisa de dietrich

imeeting once more her beloved grandduchess who was then making the tour of europe also in the company of her husband this portion of the work is very interesting for the baroness gives us a much more lifelike sketch than we possessed before of the haut monde at the period immediately prior to the revolution the reception accorded by the court of versailles to the successors of the czarina was as might naturally be expected very splendid indeed  and madame doberkirclr as the intimate friend of the grandduchess was not excluded from a full participation in them the severe laws of etiquette were even abated somewhat in her favour for the royal family dispensing in her case with the tedious formula of presentation admitted her at once to the freedom granted to distinguished foreigners the grandduke and duchess made their european tour under the title of the count and countess du nord and a few words of explanation as to the cause of this will not be misplaced as giving some idea of the extraordinary rigidity of french etiquette which since the days of louis xiv had become so severe and unbending that the court refused to recognise at all the rank of foreign princes before the imperial majesty of france all ranks though never so illustrious mingled indiscriminately with the common herd and when it so happened that visitors of royal rank were favoured with an invitation to dine they could not be allowed the honour of touching hands on this account it became the custom of such foreign magnates as desired a closer inspection of the glories of versailles to appear there under fictitious names by making which sacrifice to the dignity of the french throne the laws of etiquette were somewhat relaxed in their favour and they were admitted as a matter of grace to familiarities which under their proper titles they would not have been permitted to claim as a matter of right immediately on her arrival in paris the baroness lost no time in paying her respects to madame bertin the famous court milliner of the day of this ladys inflated ideas of her own importance many amusing anecdotes are related on one occasion a provincial lady of some importance applied to her for a headdress when the milliner having eyed her from head to foot and appearing satisfied with the result of her examination turned with a majestic air to one of her assistants saying  show this lady the result of my last conference with her majesty the impressions produced upon the mind of the baroness by the splendours of versailles appear to have been of the most lively description she attended the reception of her friend the countess du non and was present at an entertainment subsequently given in honour of the illustrious guests after dinner the entire court assembled in the saloon de la paix where there was to be a concert there were places in the gallery for persons who had been presented but had not received invitations from the queen the palace was all brilliantly illuminated as on days of high ceremonial a thousand chandeliers depended from the ceilings and every bracket supported a branch holding forty waxlights the effect was magical it would be impossible to give an adequate description of the splendour and richness of the decorations of the magnificence of the dresses or of the matchless beauty of the queen who lent a grace and charm to everything around her  one of the most striking coup deils that i have ever seen is that oif the royal family at a ball when all the court is assembled there is a gracious majesty in the bearing of the queen particularly in her airs de ttme which is peculiar to herself the kindness and affability of the king are extreme their majesties are followed by madame elizabeth and all the princes and princesses all attended by their respective suites the effect is magical as well by the quantity and splendour of the jewels as by the gold and silver embroideries and the richness of the stuff those who have not seen this tabeau ricant can form no idea of it alas alas but a short period of years and these airs de the what were they before the pitiless undiscriminating edge of the guillotine the literati of paris were of course not at all backward in paying their court to the heir to the empire of the czars and foremost among them came m de la harpe of whom the baroness does not appear to have entertained the most favourable opinion his excessive and ridiculous selflove says she was unbearable no amount of compliments could satisfy him he was become a burden to us all an anecdote she relates of him is very happy indeed one day soon after the appearance and damnation of his tragedy the barmecide he happened to be walking near the carriage in which were seated the baroness and two other ladies of faishion when a man passed by crying  who will btuy my walkingsticks a la barmicide walkingsticks  la barmcide said one of the ladies  that ought to interest you m de la iiarpe allow rue to present you with one of these canes in remembrance of your great success the man was accordingly summoned to approach the carriage and presented three or four canes with very ugly ivory balls on the tops why do you call the in a la barmecide  said the lady  you shall see madame said the man with a very knowing air and taking off one of the ivory balls he showed that it concealed an immense ratcall the ladies had the cruelty to burst into laughter and as for poor de la iiarpe le could as beaumarchais said have shed tears of bile in spite of the previous declaration of her willingness to play the part of a mecena8 her aristocratic predelictions caused the baroness to hold the school of free philosophers then springing up in the greatest horror and detestation she speaks of them constantly in almost a prophetic spirit as  those gentlemen who have caused and will yet cause us so much evil rousseau she appears to have held in especial horror that she should visit the sins of the times upon the poor philosophers and spare her favourite nobility is somewhat as if one were to pardon those who wilfully set fire to a city and punish only those who raise the alarm her strong gorx sense does not appear to have saved her from a tendency to superstition to which indeed she confesses a natural predisposition several clairroyant stories and a ghost story imposed upon her credulity by the grandduke of russia in which the ghost of peter the great is summoned from the world of spirits would have been better bestowed in a collection of marvellous tales than in a work assuming the credit of authenticity in may 1784 m doberkirch visited paris for the second time and underwent the ceremony of being formally presented to her sovereign the strictness with which the examination into the respectability of applicants for this distinetion was conducted may be inferred from the fact that the testimonials of noble descent were required to date from the year 1399 and even then loutis xvi reserved to himself the power of accepting or refusing the testimonials and of deciding in all doubtful cases the officer upon whom the duty of verifying the testimonials of descent devolved was ciierin surnamed on account of his flexibility in this respect the incorriptibh it was in reference to this dignitary that chamfort said when nature wishes to make a virtuous man or a man of genius she does not go to cherin the baroness however passed happily through the ordeal and she complacently indulges us with an enumeration of the various advantages consequent upon the honour titled ladies such as duchesses the wives of spanish grandees and those whose families possessed the hereditary honours of the louvre took on their presentation the privilege of the tabouret which was an imperial of crimson velvet bound with gold to be worn on their carriages and they might have a dais erected in their drawingrooms the king also had to kiss them when they were presented to him but this is said to have been a ceremony very disagreeable to louis xvi his two predecessors possibly did not find it so during this visit to paris as one day she was walking in the palais royal with her husband mie doberkirch happened to tread upon the toe of the celebrated dancer vestris the rebuke of the great man was characteristic  madame said he  you have escaped putting all paris into mourning for a fortnight this dieu de danse used to say that in his day there were three great men in europe himself the king of prussia and m de voltaire some anecdotes of lady craven and her connexion with the margrave of anspach will not be without interest to those who study the annals of our aristocracy and a transcript of the confessions of the celebrated duchess of kingstoir supplied to the baroness by the duchess herself will be read with very great interest when the bastille fell the baroness donenkircii set a period to her story for worlds she writesfor worlds i would not

tone it is ifncult to avoid misgivings as to the authenticity generally of the contents of the book whether however they be all romance or in part true narration these  memoirs will amuse such persons as have speculated on the influences of court service and found the same constant results whether the court servant be a voltaire employed to wash the dirty linen of frederic the great a madame de

heroinethe princess dorothea of wiirtemberg daughter of prince frederick eugene who took up his abode at montbeliard in alsace in 1769is described as a model of perfection herself of good alsa lian family the daughter of a baron von walduer and early united to an estimable man madame doberkirch yet seems to have lived hardly so much for father kinsfolk husband or child as for the dear dear princess the latter married the archduke paul of russia and the august pair travelled as the count and countess du nord this affectionate and admiring friendship on the part of madame doberkirchwhich was warmly reciprocated by its objectis the pivot on which the interest of these memoirs turns neither of the two contracting parties exhibits any force or originality of character  neither is described as undergoing any painful amount of vicissitude but they pass along through shows files journeys and state receptions  chatting about fashions dresses singers and dancers and every now and then enjoying a little innocent scandal  though madame doberkirch takes frequent pains to assure us that she was behind or before her time in her discouragement of double entendre or of evil report besides the countess du nord madame doberkirch had a friend and confidante the duchess of bourbonby whom she was tempted twice to paris enough is now told to give the reader an idea of the argument and the character of these volumes and to make him understand that we do not warrant all the stories which they contain this premised we need only add that the baronesss social philosophies were of the school then trembling on the very verge of that rude shock from which it has never recovered the privileged aristocrat breathes over all her pagesnot very offensively it is true because the tone is so visibly the communication of a vicious education to a mind of the very commonest class to the apprehension of those by whom she was surrounded  order implied merely the ascendancy of their own order madame doberkirchs dwarf mind could not look over the low artificial barriers which were set up from childhood around it and which the coming tempest was to sweep away from her youth she wore aristocratic blinkers and nothing in her mind ever suggested their throwing off early in her volumes she formulates her own moral blindness and judicial littleness i have the weakness if it be one to esteem what the heroes of the present day call trifles and i ask in my future soninlaw if providence should send me one in the midst of the chaos which surrounds us and which seems about to swallow up all social order i ask i say in my soninlaw only high birth there is a remedy for every defect but the want of thatthat is the keynote of her volumes an introduction to the cardinal de rohan at strasburg brought madame doberkirch into momentary relations with one more famous than the cardinal a very interesting conversation then commenced in which i took a real pleasure the cardinal being both wellinformed and wellbred when we were suddenly interrupted by a gentleman usher who opening the foldingdoors announced  his eminence the count de cagliostro   he was not strictly speaking handsome but never have i seen a more remarkable countenance his glance was so penetrating that one would be almost tempted to call it supernatural i could not describe the expression of his eyesit was so to say a mixture of flame and ice he attracted and repulsed and whilst he terrified inspired an insurmountable curiosity two portraits have been painted of him both very good likenesses and yet each widely different from the other he wore attached to his watch chain and upon his fingers diamonds which if they were what they appeared would be worth a king ransom he pretended that they were his own manufacture all this frippery revealed unmistakably the charlatan scarcely had the cardinal perceived than he ran to meet him and whilst he saluted him at the door said something which i did not try to overhear both approached us i had risen at the same time as the bishop but immediately resumed my place not wishing to allow this adventurer to believe that i would accord him any attention i was however soon forced to think of him  and i acknowledge now in all humility that i had no cause to repent having always had a passion for the marvellous his eminence contrived at the end of about five minutes not without some opposition on my part as well as on that of m doberkirch to make the conversation general he had the tact not to name mehad he done so i should have instantly risen but he contrived to manage the conversation so that hsprotig sometimes addressed us and politeness obliged us to reply cagliostro all this time continued to stare at me my husband made me a sign to come away but i felt the glance of these deep mysterious eyes enter my bosom like a gimlet i can find no better comparison to express the effect they produced upon me he suddenly interrupted m de rohan who par parcntlttee was overwhelmed with joy and said to me abruptlymadam your mother no longer lives you have scarcely known her and you have one daughter you are the only daughter of your family and you will have no more children i was so surprised that i looked round me not supposing it possible that he could have the audacity to address a lady of my rank in such a place and such a presence i thought he was speaking to somebody else and did not answer  reply madam said the cardinal with a supplicating air my lord madame doberkirch speaks upon such subjects only with thoee with whom she has the honour of being acquainted replied my husband in a tone that was almost impertinent i feared that he might forget the respect due to the bishop he rose and made a haughty salute i did the same the cardinal accustomed to find flatterers in all who approached him was embarrassed he did not know what to do however he drew near to m doberkirch cagliostro staring at me and addressed him in words so soothing that it was impossible to resist their influence  m de cagliostro is a learned man we must not treat him as an ordinary person added he  remain a few moments my dear baron allow madame doberkirch to reply there is neither sin nor impropriety i assure you and even if there were have i not the power of absolving in reserved cases  i have not the honour of being of your flock my lord interrupted m doberkirch with some slight remains of illhumour i know that but too well sir and am sorry for it you would do honour to our church baroness tell us whether m de cagliostro has been mistakentell us i pray you he has not been mistaken as to what concerns the past i replied not being able to refuse to bear testimony to the truth and i nm as little mistaken in what concerns the future said cagliostro in a tone so metallic that it echoed like the sound produced by a trumpet veiled with crape here are a few paris fashions for 1784  after the opera we went to the tuileries then the fashionable promenade but as the parisians do everything through caprice they selected one alley and would not take a step in any of the others all were suffocating some persons almost fought the buttons of the gentlemens coats carried off thc lace trimming of the ladies mantelets falbalas were torn by the pommels of swords and flounces of point lace were sometimes seen dangling from the end of a scabbard gentlemen began about this time to go about unarmed and wore swords only in full dress the humbler classes imitated them and fashion was more powerful than authority could have been   it is now the fashion to dine at three oclock and the time for dinner is very short of which the gastronomists and cooks complain sorely it seems as though the folk nowadays eat only for the sake of nutriment and wish when they have satisfied their appetites to fly from table the old people say that such conduct is not dignified the cooks are in open rebellion  people swallow said the cook of the duchess de la valliere they no longer taste i am dishonoured    ten is the hour for supper and the rapidity of execution at this meal is not less than at dinner the repast is not now announced to the lady of the house when dinner is ready the butler appears and the lady rises the age of gourmandise is past but our tables are not less elegantly laid the luxury ofthe i present day is alarming the men have scarcely j time to eat and drink  some of them have essayed j to be very engaging very gay even gallant hoping  to detain the ladies longer endeavouring possibly by these means to secure themselves a little time for j digestion i know one gentleman who commenced j a very interesting story after the first course interrupting himself every momentbreaking off his narrative by questions replies jeux de mots and various other artifices hoping thus to make it last a considerable time he succeeded in prolonging his history and keeping the attention of his auditors awake until after the fruit appeared and his appetite had been fully satisfied he practised this manoeuvre every evening and always succeeded   this blessed 6th of june she awakened me at the earliest dawn  i was to get my hair dressed and j make a grand toilette in order to go to versailles whither the queen had invited the countess du nord for whose amusement a comedy was to be performed these court toilettes are neverending and this road from paris to versailles very fatiguing especially when one is in continual fear of rumpling her petticoat and flounces i tried that day for the first time a new fashionone too which was not a little gtnante i wore in my hair little flat bottles shaped to the curvature of the head into these a little water was poured for the purpose of preserving the freshness of the natural flowers worn in the hair and of which the stems were immersed in the liquid this did not always succeed but when it did the effect was charming nothing could be more lovely than the floral wreath crowning the snowy pyramid of powdered hair and here are one or two fashionable personages of the time u i had been invited to a morning concert at the count dalbarets he is a rich piedmontese who has musicians in his own pay who live in his house and do not go out without his permission isle is passionately fond of music he has a large hall for the use of musicians where they practice all day for this reason his concerts are admirable  they are reputed the best iu paris that is easily understood a perfect harmony must exist between musicians who always practice together m dalbaret possesses a great deal of talent and writes very pretty verse he is a virtuoso in all the arts he is the intimate friend of madame de la massais and of madame de la rcyniere   m dalbaret often took a part in theatrical pieces with mesdames de montesson and de genlis he was the friend of both which was strange considering the cordial hatred they entertained for one another when i say he was their friend i mean that he was an acquaintance of both hut he did not like them  and i have heard that he gave very striking descriptions of each and not at all flattering madame de montesson had the airs of an upstart commoner and they seemed as natural to her as her mothers milk she sweated pride1 said la har pe and he ought to be a judge of the sentiment her life was a continued scene of domestic acting of which the object was to seduce that poor duke of orleans she got up scenes of which the parts had been rehearsed beforehand but he did not see through the artifice  she revels on beds of roses and in ermined robes with slipshod heels and cotton stocking said one day the duchess of bourbon to whom the mention of her stepmother caused a nausea it was she who most strongly resisted the idea of draping her carriage on the death of the first prince of the blood she went to thc king and boldly revealed to him what thc duke de chartres would have concealed the king ordered that the duchess of orleans inpartibus alas said the duchess of bourbon  we can no longer acid infidelium as she is well marriedthat madame de montesson in short should enter into the convent ofthe assumption where in its strict enclosure she may assume her queenly airs for her own private amusement i am anticipating events but all this escaped my pen as it ran rapidly through my thoughts the vanity of madame de genlis  the tutor showed itelf in a different fashion i do not wish to enter into particulars i did not like her spite of her accomplishments and the charm of her conversation she was too systematic she ls a woman who has laid aside the flowing robes of her sex for i the culottes of a pedagogue besides nothing about her is natural she is constantly in an attitude as it were thinking that her portrait moral or physical is being taken she attaches too much importance to her celebrityshe thinks too much of her own opinions one of the great follies of this masculine woman is her harp she carries it about with her she speaks of it when it is not nearshe plays upon a crust of bread and practises with a piece of packthread when she perceives that anybody is looking at her she rounds her arm pinches up her mouth assumes a sentimental look and attitude and begins to move her fingers what a charming quality is simplicity of character we will add to this sketch a picture of the rout of those times  m de louvois had been very wild in his youth and spent his money with marvellous facility his lather irritated by his extravagance refused to supply him with the means of continuing his disorderly career and his credit being quite exhausted he was forced to return like the prodigal son to the paternal chateau he arrived unencumbered by a second coat a largo party had been invited to dinner but as our hero expected the company to be rather stupid he wished not to appear giving his toilet as an excuse monsieur said his father  i will expect you to join this dinner party i should feel much pleasure but you see it is impossible this coat wear another i have not got it you have not one  after spending sixty thousand livres with tailors and embroiderers that would have been a very good reason formerly but it is no longer so they are all worn out get one  monsieur that is easily said but to get a coat one must have money  and at this moment  what alter borrowing two hundred thousand livres from usurersmon dieu monsieur i do not mean to contradict you but the crowns have followed the coatsm dc louvois raised his eyes and arms to heaven uttered an exclamation of anger and left the roomhe turned when he got to the door and said i will not enter into a discussion on your extravagance monsieur  but i will say that i desire to see you at my table on the appointed day and that i forbid you to appear there in the coat you now wearthe chevalier was stunnedembarrassed he knew not what to do the paternal mandate was positive and he had no hope of future assistance from his father if he did not obey him now isle called his valet a second scapin and they put all their wits to work to find some means of getting out of this dilemma but in vain human invention seemed unequal to the task the chevalier was distracted  he paced his chamber in dismay when casting his eyes upon the hangings which represented the marriage procession of alexander and statira a sudden thought struck him ah  said he  i know what i will do go into the village and bring me the tailor with all his implements immediately and tell him to prepare to spend the night here but m le chevalier go immediately and do not replywhen the valet had left the room lie proceeded with the greatest coolness to take down though curtains off his bed and laying them on a table marked out the figures he admired most the tailor was broughtcome my man said he you must make a coat vest and culotte out of this be sure to choose the handsomest ladies for the front nnd this high priest with his long bearii will do very well for the back the valet and the tailor thought and with very good reason that their young master was losing his senses but he was so determined that they were obliged to obey the suit was finished in time and fitted extremely well the chevalier was very well pleased and having completed his toilet descended to the diningroom which he entered with an imperturbable countenance he was received with shouts of laughter his father was very angry but this public disgrace obliged him to open his purse for his extravagant heir who with fresh funds returned to paris he became very intimate with mademoiselle colombe an actress at the italian comedy and in a transport of gratitude he one day asked her what he could do that would give her pleasure send me some chatons precious stones said she to make a necklace next day she received a box full of little cats rthich are also called chatons this jest was j equally well received at court and in the greenrooro which unfortunately are beginning to have only too many things in common some fresh amusement soon succeeded and this refined witticism was forgotten of madame de genlis and her eternal harp madame

labours of his literary lifehis poems covering a period of forty yearsfrom 1816 to 1857commencing when byron had only begun to assert himself before keats had published and when shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny when wordsworth and coleridge had few readers and when it was perversely held that poetry should be modelled on something that had gone before the varied reputations made iu forty years never seduced mr story from the path he originally chose beginning life as a northumberland herdboy he was  literally charmed by dr watts but springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration he dashed into a style resembling the minor flights of burns then as now most keenly loved and appreciated amongst an otherwise unread northern peasantry his poems are dated and usually have some two or three lines of historical gossip which give interest because clearly carrying truth the first poems are all lovemary k to the same to the same by the dozen when

second manner and judging by the present story we are not quite sure that the second manner is not an improvenment on the first tlliere is certainly an advance in arta finer pencil and a surer touch indeed the change of style and subject is very much what we may conceive to be the natural growth of moral experience there is less of the rollicking animal spirits the reckless gaiety and adventure the buoyant audacity of the early time the day is waning and the shadows lengthen  the old fire within gives out a cheery light and a genial warmth  but the young gentlemen who danced and rode and

wardrobe has been displayed for inspection along a hedge of sweetbriar in the gardenan arrangement devised by the genius of darby who pases up and down with an expression of admiration on his face the sincerity of which could not be questioned a more reflective mind than his might have been carried away at the sight to thoughts of the strange passages in the late history of ireland so curiously typified in that motley display there was the bright green dresscoat of dalys club recalling days of political excitement and all the plottings and cabals of a once famous opposition there was in somewhat faded splendour it must be owned a court suit of the duke of portlands day when irish gentlemen were as gorgeous as the courtiers of versailles here came a grand colonels uniform when barrington commanded a regiment of volunteers and yonder lay a friars frock and cowl relics of those  attic nights with the monks of the screw and recalling memories of avonmore and curran and day and parsons and with them were mixed hunting coats and shootingjackets and masonic robes and  friendly brother emblems and longwaisted garments and swallowtailed affectations of all shades and tintsreminders of a time when buck whalley was the eccentric and lord llandaff the beau of irish society i am not certain theft monmouthstreet would have endorsed darbys sentiment as he said  there was clothes there for a king on his throne but it was an honestly uttered speech and came out of the futlness of an admiring heart and although in truth ho was nothing less than an historian he was forcibly struck by the thought that ireland must have been a grand country to live in in thu old dapy when men went about their ordinary avocations in such splendour as he saw there  nor was peter barrington himself an unmoved spectator of these old remnants of the past old garments like old letters bring oftentinics very forcible memories of a long ago and as he turned over the purplestained flap of a waistcoat he bethought him of a night at dalys when in returnin g thanks for his health his shaking hand had spilled that identical glass of burgundy and in the duncoloured tinge of a huntingcoat he remembered the day he had plunged into the nore at corrig oneal himself and the huntsman alone of all the field to follow the dogs   take them away darby take them away they only set me

huntingfield do you see that peachcoloured waistcoat it was lady caher embroidered every stitch of it with her own hands for me   thems elegant black satin breeches said darby whose eyes of covetousness were actually rooted on the object of his desire   i never wore them said barrington with a sigh  i got them for a duel with mat fortescue but sir toby blake shot him that morning poor mat c and i suppose youll never wear them now you couldnt bear the sight then said darby insinuatingly c most likely not said barrington as he turned away with a heavy sigh darby sighed also but not precisely in the same spirit  let me passingly remark that the total unsuitability to his con dition of any object seems rather to enhance its virtue in the eyes of a lower irishman and a hat or a coat which he could not by any possibility wear in public might still be to him things to covet and desire   what is the meaning of all this rag fair  cried miss barrington as she suddenly came in front of the exposed wardrobe  you are not surely making any selections from these tawdry absurdities brother for your journey    well indeed said barrington with a droll twinkle of his eye it was a point that darby and i were discussing as you came up darby opines that to make a suitable impression upon the continent i must not despise the assistance of dress and he inclines much to that corbeau coat with the cherrycoloured lining if darbys an ass brother i dont imagine it is a good reason to consult him said she angrily  put all that trash where you found it lay out your masters black clothes and the grey shootingcoat see that his strong boots are in good repair and get a serviceable lock on that valise it was little short of magic the spell of these few and distinctly uttered words seemed to work on darby who at once descended from a realm of speculation and scheming to the commonplace world of duty and obedience i really wonder how you let yourself be imposed on brother

that the stakes are small im never vexed at his winning   but you seem to forget the encouragement this impunity sug gests   perhaps it does dinah and very likely his little rogueries arm as much triunphs to him as are all the great political intrigues the glories of some grand statesman   which means that you rather like to be cheated said she scoffingly i when the loss is a mere trifle i dont always think it ill laid out i and i said she resolutely  so far from participating in your sentiment feel it to be an insult and an outrage there is a sense of inferiority attached to the position of a dupe that would drive me to any reprisals  ii always said it i always said it cried he laughing the women of our family monopolised all the combativeness  miss barringtons eyes sparkled

povertystricken but wellborn girl alone in london the case is no uncommon one nor happily is the courageous high spirit to meet it emily foxseton much to her own surprise a marchioness preserves in spite of daily anxieties a natural joyousness and trust which are the basis of her character the author writes with some care for detail and probability yet this very care now and again suggests that all is not taken sur le vif the lady reader who knows what straightened gentility really means may note small discrepancies it is easy to see that comely wholesome emily is a persona gratissima with her author before lord walderhurst comes into her life  to stay the account of how the girl for at thirtyfour she is a girl manages to keep up an appearance bordering on smartness on twenty pounds a year supplemented of course by daily toil is quite a study she makes herself generally useful to and liked by ladies who want their shopping choosing of servants and other things done by proxy all these and other things she does with neatness and dispatch her qualities are not what one expects from the usual heroine of fiction but one grows interested in her works and ways and even her skirts in spite of some unnecessary repetitions the fresh and friendly ways of the  creature as some of her patrons call her appeal to them as they do to us and she is in much request when to her own utter surprise and intense gratitude she becomes lady walderhurst she retains her simple and kindly habits but she does not at once live happily ever afterwards   she is made to undergo many and great dangers we cannot say much in praise of the way this part of her story is unfolded perhaps however the authors numerous admirers will not be hypercritical but will enjoy her story without analysing it

lovable womanly heroine of thirtysix a dependent ladycompanion in great houses who finds an unselfish happiness in promoting the happiness of others and so engaged unconsciously wins the affection of the mature widowed marquis of walderhurst and after a short matteroffact wooing becomes the marchioness the second part is equally good until the marquis has to go abroad then captain osborne heirpresumptive of the marquis who is staying near by with his wife in a house his lordship has lent them is invited to come with his household and become the nlarchionesss guests for a while and under her roof they are better able to carry out diverse diabolical attempts on her life the captains desperation increasing when he learns she is expecting an heir he wants to teach her horseriding intending to arrange a throw for her but she declines aided by his indian servant he deposits a broken cornice on the stairs on the chance of her falling over it saws through the rail of a wooden bridge on which she often leans to watch sunsets poisons her glass of milk but she is saved by her faithful maid and the repentance of the captains wife and fleeing for safety goes into hiding in london the characterisation is so consistently true in the case of emily and the marquis and his cousin lady maria to say nothing of minor persons that one resents the intrusion of this melodramatic captain with his stagey outfit of bluefire villanies and resents it the more because after he has departed to india the story closes with a return to its earlier natural note and the winning of the nmarchioness back from the gates of death is a pathetic and human touch that makes the preceding sensationalism the more unreal withal the book is so eminently interesting that however much you may

burnett smith elder 6s mks burnett has not done herself justice in this book melodrama is all very well in its own place but out of its placethat is in a novelit demands very special treatment excellent work has been done before now by placing real human characters in melodramatic situations or less often and with greater skill by placing melodramatic characters in real human situations dickens did the former over and over again  mr meredith bus occasionally and very happily done the latter now thc author of thc making vf a marchioness has done neither she has quite frankly placed melodramatic people in melodramatic situations and the result as a novel is not convincing we have a poor hardworking virtuous and rather stupid heroineit is impossible of course in a melodrama to ally virtue with the smallest smattering of brainsand we have a rich handsome virtuous and rather stupid hero who is naturally a marquis and marries the heroine we have come across that taciturn but noble and deeplyfeeling englishman so often that we really begin to think he must exist further as all true melodrama demands we have the villain who would have succeeded to the title if the marquis had not married again and the villains wife who is dark and gipsylike and clenches her thin hands at every opportunity and in the background is the smart lady who says the smart things it is scarcely necessary to mention that the comic relief is maintained in the usual way by the faithful servingmaid and the faithful servingmaids mother every one of these people no doubt exists in a world that is made up of all sorts just as the plots which are laid against the life of the marchioness might with perfect possibility le laid against the life of any real marchioness who is in the way butand this is the pointit is the novelists business to select and mrs burnett has selected neither characters nor incidents fairly the complexity of life which the novelist unlike the playwright has every opportunity of presenting is scarcely suggested in the making of a marchioness and the author gives away her point of view in the sentence  the scene lietween the three was fair too subtle to be of the least use upon the stage but it was a good scene nevertheless now that unwritten scene would probably have done for the book what all the unconvincing incidents in it have failed in doing perhaps it is her descent to melodrama that has made mrs burnett unusually careless of her style  appalling  is a good word but is scarcely applicable to a change of fashion in skirts page 1 honest drops of

B8984,['8907271'],  literature the writings of john greenleaf whittier 7 vols macmillan  co this edition of the works of mr whittier is intended at least as to the poems to be complete unless so far as there are hopes that the time  honoured author whose  brown dwarf of eugen  and  one of the signers date only from last year may add some postscripts of pleasant verse to the collection which now contains he says  all that i care to republish and some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself i should have omitted at the request of his publishers mr whittier has in this edition allowed the reappearance though only in an appendix of early poems which for many years he has banished as not worthy of his nameand as to which indeed it is not possible to say that his name will restore them to the favour with which they were received by american readers of sixty years ago when as he apologetically remarks  the standard of criticism was not discouragingly high the publishers object in persuading mr whittier to republish the things that he would rather not have written was  to make the edition so complete and retrospective that students of the poets career will always find the most abundant materials for their purpose and if we are to suppose that mr whittiers readers read not for the sake of his poetry but to give themselves a course of educational study on his career as a poet the appendix may certainly be useful to them tor the excess of juvenile efflorescence and the protraction of its period in mr whittiers case as contrasted with the fact of his nevertheless coming to a fruitage time are shown by the poems in this appendix and their dates to be exceptional and though the phenomenon is easily explainable by the cause mr whittier assigns for the popularity of his verse in its turgid immaturity it offers something for the student of the career to study if he will take the trouble to compare with mr whittiers literary infancy the literary infancies of other writers who earlier or as late as he like him eventually arrived at literary years of discretion but even from this point of view it is difficult to see any sufficient advantage gained to the world by overruling mr whittiers wisely critical judgement of his least meritorious productions the arrangement has however given him the opportunity of dismissing the tedious and unreal attempt in the school of scott  mogg megone which disfigured his former collected editions to the limbo of the appendix and thus increasing the honour to which his riper work entitles him from all critics who appreciate artistic unaffectedness and the grace of sobriety the poems of mr whittiers literary prime vary much in quality but all have at least the strength of manly common sense good taste and direct expression while many possess also either reticent and therefore effective pathos or a certain eager and orderly rush rather perhaps of orator than of poet but instinct with metrical vigour which has characterised some of his most popular pieces his boundaries have not been wide but within them he has been master he has been sure of his purpose and what he purposed he could effect and he has shown an understanding of his limits which is in itself a faculty of no mean order in england his poetry taking it all in all has not met with the wide and somewhat undiscriminating acceptance it has received from his own countrymen and only a few pieces can be named as having become favourites of our general public but we may fairly say that the restriction of the welcome on this side the water is quite as undiscriminating as its liberality on the other side for instance now that every one knows  maud muller why are there comparatively few who are familiar with  telling

the pinetree in her banners tattered field  this is a fine piece of passionate rhetoric and has real fire in it still mr whittiers antislavery poems do not show him at his best as a poet indeed nobodys antislavery poems ever have been truly poems though some rare few have like  the pine  tree been very good metrical speeches the theme would seem on first thoughts just what must have made any man whose heart was hot about it and who could put feelings into verse at all capable of true poetry for that if for nothing else and must have inspired any true poet with dramatic force and lyric passion to make his least words on it immortal but second thoughts explain why the fact has been so much the reverse antislavery was not a theme for a poet it was too abstract too political and above all too argumentative a great poet might with one short drama one lyric one stanza nay one line about some slave who never existed but in his mind and his readers minds have found his way to human hearts then and for all hereafter as long as the english language lasts but there were in the antislavery agitation no poets who could or would write their poems on the slaves side so the antislavery poets were absorbed in the great public question with all its disputatious details they were in the thick of debates and arguments they wrote them with thought of their opponentsto answer to persuade or to attack poems so written may have their influence in a great public controversy but the controversy over their life is gone they are like weapons of an ancient warfareweapons we respect in the museums but that have no purpose in them for our days mrs beecher stowe in her own line of art managed better she used sympathies of human nature that belonged to all times and peoples and produced a novel which was genuinely a novel with the novels power to absorb attention to amuse and to move and which whatever its faults has lost nothing of that power by reason of the slavery question having become obsolete to her the theme does seem to have given inspiration beyond her normal faculty so that this one book of hers her worst as to some glaring bad qualities has in it a something amounting to genius which her other works can by no means parallel her imagination seems to have been aroused by her zeal while the zeal of the poets whirled their imaginations away and left it the only difference between their polemical productions and those of other able rhetoricians that theirs were in verse and had more similes in them much the same has always been the case with poets polemics weean call to mind no verse directly dealing with aay question agitating the public mind catting for any wrong to be righted urging any great measure which has had it in it to aurvive as poetry the success of its cause except mrs brownings  song of the children and that the  song of the children though intended polemically not only had aa influence on the public mind at the time bat stands forth a poem is because mrs browning with the high poets sympathetic instinct went at once forth from herself aad let her pleadings and her reasonings pass into the piteous simplicity of the thoughts and words of the childrenjust as she would have done in fact had their miseries belonged to ancient history or to an imaginary world to take mr whittier at his best as distinctively a poet we must go to his  poems of nature poems subjective and reminiscent and  narrative and legendary poems as is inevitable when a writer tries to classify his collected poems the series overlap and a piece that stands in one series might as fitly or more fitly stand in another  and it is the merit of the beet poems in these three series that they might all lay claim from one point of view or another to belong to the poems of nature  telling the bees  in the  narrative and legendary poems owes its charm to this and its tender implication and tu4 narration of the simple love and simple sorrow here is the place

and occasional we confine our remarks to the pieces that rightfully belong to these headings when we say that this kind of verse is not so favourably appreciated in england as it appears to be iu the united states possibly all our poets too in their private life write verse to each other but if so they except in one or two exceptional instances do not publish it and they are not often called on for odes and hymns at  celebrations  and openings and anniversariesand so much the better the critic always feels regret when he finds the abilities of men with real gifts frittered away upon these politenesses of the prose there is no need to say much it does not compel blame it does not invite praise margaret smiths journal the editor tells his readers presents a tolerably lifelike picture of the past  unfortunately it does not the shorter tales also show that mr whittier has not that gift of vividness of making even transparent unreality seem true till the moment the reader leaves off reading which is specially the novelists the papers in the two other volumes are on  the conflict with slavery on politics and reforms on literary and historic subjects or are brief biographies of men and of books and tributes to contemporariesall of them manifestly contributions to periodical literature they have of course spirit and purpose we marked from one paper only at least a dozen passages quite amazing for inflation mixed metaphor and bad taste passing to another paper we found not one florid sentence the prose works are not dated but the difference in style must be a matter of dates and it may be reasonably inferred that the florid papers belong to the immature period and the better ones be taken as the true standard of mr whittiers prose,dom

for the sake of that very memory all this is very well handled and the charm of the bookfor it has great charmconsists in the revelation at times weirdly feminine of the delights of babyhood in its dressing and undressing its attitude to mothers and others its early cricket also as it were involuntarily which is good art of an entirely sweet and kindly nature in the soldier one cannot help guessing that one is really learning all about the author io the character of a parent even as before we met him not altogether without a hint of undue expansiveness in that of a son the book would form an excellent textbook for parents learning their business but hardly is one we fancy that childish readers would appreciate such episodes as that of the inconsiderate waiter whose throes between humanity and conventionality are entertaining to older folks would be lost on children the story of peter pan who fled back to birdlife in his infancy would engross them more though it is complicated with ideas addressed to the adult and educated mr barries book has as we have said great charm otherwise we should not be able to read a thing so discursive and casual arrangement there is none episodes are far too lengthy and the whole thing if one may say so bulges in the wrong places there is cheap work too in the fabric which a good craftsman ought not to pass why does mr barrie use an odious and unnecessary verb like  to suspicion  he can as the cosmopolitan man says hit us where we live and he can make the best of most things why does he not make the best of the english language

B4568,['8666996'],  mademoiselle mathilde new novels by henry kingsley i 3 vols bradbury  evans tins last production of mr kingsley will disappoint his readers not that there is any j absence of vigour or point in the writing  or any change in those peculiarities of style  which have gained him admirers on the contrary mademoiselle mathilde exhibits that delicacy of feeling that power of expression which distinguish the author from the ordinary novelist and which will always prevent his works from becoming tame or commonplace it is not then in the style of the writing that this book will fail nor in the way the history of the heroines life is worked out but in the very essence of a successful novel  in the story itself we must premise that in using the word fail as applied here we do not intend it to convey the idea of an utter failure but rather that mr kingsley will not create such an impression as he has done by preceding compositions the cause of this want of success arises from the story itself and this might be expected when the circumstances under which it was written are well considered mr kingsley says in his preface  the choice of a story was extremely difficult till in consultation one said tell them the story we heard at st malo and of which we have so often spoken since the thing was done from this we can easily deduce that mr kingsley contracted to write a novel that at the time the contract was made he had no plot or story or even any idea of one ready and that thereupon he hunted about and took the first that offered this haphazard method of selecting a subject to work upon did not deserve to succeed nor has it ever succeeded though it appears to be the favourite method of writers of the present day probably because it saves trouble how strange it is that novelists will not understand the vital importance of first choosing a good story and then telling it in their best fashion instead of acting in the manner suggested they seem to sit down to scribble with the very slightest notion of what their narrative is to be and trust to the brightness of their description and power of depicting lively conversations to compensate for deficiencies in the tale to start with it is always a mistake to found a novel upon a true story why this should be the case admits of many explanations but without discussing the reasons for it it is enough for us that it is a fact as is evident when we remember that historical novels have hitherto been failures even sir walter scotts historical novels were very much inferior to his domestic mdlle mathilde is no exception to the rule throughout the work it is obvious that the author is trammelled by his desire to adhere to the true account of his heroines life as much as possible and that relying too much on this cutanddried narrative he has not allowed himself the free exercise of that power of imagination which is one of his best gifts again the tale itself is too meagre and to compensate for this the author has been obliged to thrust prominently forward a lot of uninteresting and useless personages who bore the readerwilliam the silent for example that  this was inevitable appears at once when we riate what mdlle mathildes history really is this heroineand she was truly onein love with a young englishman and by him beloved sacrifices her own life in the french revolution to save her sisters this is the whole story of course it can be and is magnified to a very great extent but still details however well worked out and however numerous will not alter the story to use a poetical illustration in the fashion of mr weller an engraving by the new indiarubber process may be enlarged indefinitely without in any way adding to or diminishing the number and proportions of the lines in the engraving so here pages may be taken up with details of mathildes life in prison of her falling in love of her fathers servants and other like subjects but they only act as an enlargement of the original tale as we have stated it and we repeat that that tale is meagre lastly every one is tired of the french revolution to hear that a young lady was murdered by a citizen mob of the period hardly moves one so accustomed are we to all kinds of scenes of violence and horror at that time by a perusal of numberless histories we wish some author would for a change give us an idea of the brighter side of the revolution every one hitherto has delighted in painting it as black as he can till a sort of hazy idea wrvades englishmen that a good third of france perished by the guillotine or by murder daring the struggle when we consider the comparatively few who really were killed it is evident that the great mass of french people enjoyed themselves much as usual the whole time if a writer will insist on taking up this revolution again we ask him for the sake of novelty to look at it from the point of view here suggested in conclusion we may say that much as we admire mr kingsleys writings we can afford to wait a little longer for his next if he will spend the extra time on the composition of an original and more carefully selected plot,dom

B5662,"['6868800', '9375082', '2438171', '2436080']",  fiction sinister street by compton mackenzie martin i secker 6s t here are five hundred closely printed pages in t this book yet we are informed that it is but the half of the novel and that the other half will follow early next year there is nothing here that is not as it should be but we do feel inclined to take mr mackenzie aside and complain to him when we find that in spite of those five hundred closely printed pages the novel has not even begun it has not even begun in the most elementary sense of giving us someone to be interested in the present book purports to recount for us the life of one charles michael saxby fane until the time when he orders his thoughts towards oxford and the most exacting lover of detail will not deny that facts and details enough are given of the life supposed to have been led by that same charles michael saxby fane but the unfortunate fact is that he has not yet begun to exist he is but a name that serves as an excuse for an elaborate description of childhood and school affairs it is not until page 350 that some of the names begin to distinguish themselves into personalities and even after then the i distinction is not developed that is to say the characterisation is not worked out whether in terms of action or psychology and when the book concludes the potentialities of conduct and therefore of interest still do not exist when such a state of affairs occurs with a novelist of the promise of mr mackenzie it is interesting to see how it has been caused to be compelled to deny at the end of a considerable book that there is no such person as its ostensible hero is not sufficient that is only a method of evasion and if nothing else prevailed mr mackenzies standing as a novelist protects him from that easy device and when we come to examine the book closely an interesting artistic problem reveals itself that happens incidentally to concern in its implication a good deal of modern work in the novel for the novel is not a hotchpot into which anything and everything may be emptied the position of each detail is exactingly circumscribed by its significance any portion of any description that is not there for the better understanding of the central concern is just so much waste tissue and the natural result of the inclusion of such indeterminate matter must be that the central concern will be hindered in its proper development that sounds academic enough to be sure and though every defiance of academic statements is all to the good yet mr mackenzie does not justify himself there is for instance a chapter entitled characteristically enough unending childhood and in it is little that could not with advantage have been eliminated fane might have had to repeat mensa mensa mensam and so forth in a meaningless ceremonial we ourselves had to do so but we suggest that it is nothing to the purpose that we should be told of it fully we donot presume to say that to mr mackenzie that ceremonial had not some significance but he has not conveyed it to us and that is the test of the book in fact it seems to us that mr mackenzie himself has felt this for he bends his mind to making these endless details interesting for themselves by his witty telling of them and that is excellently legitimate though it does not alter the fact what is it to us that we should be told of the paper flowers that michael made at the kindergarten or of his difficulties with et and iny in the special  had these things with many other such details fully told been cut out would the book have suffered  we are compelled to answer our own question by saying frankly that the book in its present form would have suffered such details have come to occupy so large a part that the chief interest is derived from them and not from charles michael saxby fane on whose account they were ordered we are quite sure that this was not at all what a novelist like mr mackenzie meant he quotes at the outset the passage from one of keats letters to the effect that the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in a ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thicksighted that is as it were his text every external incident therefore only has significance in the degree in which it refers to this factor otherwiseof psychology but he has turned aside from artistic restraintor let us say more precisely his restraint in artand let himself loose in details that have not that significance with the result that they have crowded out the exposition of adolescence he intended have banished michael fane and reign in his stead yet even here a curious thing transpires for the events of the latter half of the book are in themselves a great deal more interesting than the events of the first half while being at the same time a great deal more in exposition of the personality that fane in consequence begins now slowly to acquire it is with the later introduction of michaels friend alan and the contrast that mr mackenzie now sets himself to display between the two that the wheels of the story begin to grip the metals but the whole fault of the book at least thus far is that it is not depicted from within outwards but from without inwards often not reaching the inner complication of nerves and desires blood and emotions and resolutions at all that is even the case in the episodes of adolescence though these are described as vivaciously as we should expect from mr mackenzies pert the lack of condensation has indeed taken off the vivid glow from his style but its general witful attitude remains though it shines no more and this is especially so with regard to the latter half it is not altogether easy to arrive at conclusions since the book itself does not our judgement is left like our interest in midair it would seem that mr mackenzie never intended originally to publish the book in two halves if he had he would probably have made each half selfcontained and selfconsistent and this particular half is neither one nor the other going lamely and uncertainly as a consequence the other half is to be expected next year perhaps the two halves will fit perfectly together and give each life if they do we shall rejoice yet at the moment our interest remains in suspended animation  fiction social studies sinister street by compton mackenzie vol ii martin seeker 65 another six hundred pages concerning michael fane  we will pay mr mackenzie the compliment of believing he could have conveyed in half the number of pages all that is essential to the understanding of the two phases of his heros life here treated wo can also affirm that there are few pages which do not carry the reader on with fresh zest book iii is a vivid presentment of oxford life though we are glad to know that detailed as it is it is not a complete picture the hero is now more than ever the young man cursed with the knowledge that all possible precautions have been made against its ever becoming necessary for him to earn his own living occasionally he is vaguely conscious of a desire to be something more than a consumer all his life  more often he is merely depressed by the futility of things as he sees them he takes part with relish in drunken orgies accompanied by a burst of destructiveness which would have been an outrage if carried out by a suffragette or a german but which many may consider creditable in his case for at the bidding of his proctor he cheerfully provides the money for the wages of those who have to repair the damage never does he reflect that his recurring satiety is obtained at the cost of many others who have no such chances his habit of oxford attitudinizing is cleverly conveyed in one of the authors comments he  consoled himself for the absence of subtlety or cleverness hi such an answer by the fact that at least it was a direct statement of what he thought once during his varsity career he is shocked by the thought that he may have some direct responsibility for the death of his mothers friend who had looked to him for sympathy in his failure to woo his sister in book iv entitled  romantic education mr mackenzie secures a striking contrast by plunging his hero into the nether world of london  down  from oxford and finding himself at a loose end  common to this type of man he turns into a musichall and thore learns that the girl he had made love to six years before has become a prostitute infatuated with the power of his personality he conceives the idea that he can save her by marrying her thus securing the opportunity to make a bigger fool of himself than ever throughout the two books which comsose this volume there are many ashes of intuition as to the contemporary leniency towards hypocrisy but we doubt whether the author meant to make his hero quite so criminal a fool in his efforts to help his fellows as he will appear to those who have to combat the misspent efforts of such people the heros friend is on occasion too obviously used as a stalkinghorse to draw forth clever disquisition and so has to appear more foolish than he really is our grasp of one character at least the heros mother is strengthened in this second volume    dearest boy i ia on though committee of a society for the abatement of london street noises   so deeply occupied with reform he said patting her hand   one must do something she smiled we thank mr mackenzio for that so far as his hero is concerned we cannot sum him up any better than we did in reviewing the first volume   his failing is the lack of a guiding principle sufficiently strong to counteract the relatively cheap allurements of life if he was as is suggested received into the roman catholic priesthood that mighty organisation may have converted a waster into a useful citizen if so it was an achievement more notable than any set down yet by mr mackenzie if this delineation brings home to any their responsibility for imbuing our enemies with the idea that we are a decadent race unworthy of our christian ideals then mr mackenzie will serve a moral as well as an artistic purpose we do not however expect so much from it the author with scathing irony depicts his hero as himself resenting  life given for the sake of thousands more unworthy living comfortably at home in the writing we admire most the authors wealth and appositeness in though choice of words on the other hand some sentences are in need of revision  sinister street volume ii by compton mackenzie martin secker 6s the temptation to write a long disquisition about this book is strong yet must be resisted space not permitting it and it is a pity for sinister street provides rich material for controversy itself touching upon so many profundities phases and ideas it provokes criticism to an unusual extent moreover it culminates in a conversion to rome this part is the weakest in the book for its reason is not obvious nor has the author taken pains to explain it one has to take it as it were cum grano for the rest the novel is genuinely interesting the picture of oxford of the good young man an english type passing through that delicious phase of youth is quite admirable then there is londonbohemian london the  gay life mr mackenzie is plainly half philosopher half esthete he can speak from the inside of women he is fearless sincere an artist if the conversion is rather temperamental than convincing it is suggestive as all the work of this author is he understands the lilys of this world altogether this is an arresting production a performance of literary merit  sinister street by compton mackenzie vol i martin secker 6s it may be that the dread prospect of the return of the three four or fivevolume novel determined the library censors to put their ban on this book when novels so popular as mr bennetts run into trilogies when even translations from french books such as jean christophe are published in england tetralogically messrs smith mudie and co may well have paused before committing themselves to the twovolume immensity of mr mackenzies new enterprise but these censors whose selfordained function it is to preserve the ignorance of youth have sufficient reason for banning this book if discussion of sex and sexuality is a crime any openminded reader of his novel will be convinced that mr mackenzie is attempting in a sincere and philosophic spirit to consider the supremely important effects upon character of the awakening of the sex impulse in youth this is very far from being the whole of his theme this influence is one among several supreme influences which he notes and analyses but it is a fact that he does give it a preponderance such as has probably never been assigned to it before in an english novel we welcome it as a sincere attempt to grapple with an important problem which not only every schoolmaster constantly discusses but which every headmaster in orders constantly preaches about in chapel before the whole of his school mr mackenzie happily does not preach for it is the business of a novelist not to preach but to present and to allow readers to come to any conclusion didactic or otherwise according to their fancy what we are concerned withbeing convinced that mr mackenzie has no arriere pensieis his truth to life and character he is addressing himself to a task similar to that of rolland in jean christophe and showing us the evolution of a boy who in the next volume is to become a mana boy sensitive yet masculine impressionable yet active ardent yet philosophic and brilliantin a certain sense a type and in another sense a superman or rather superboy michael hishers is the son of a mrs fane not married to that dimly shadowed father the earl of saxby michael and his sister stella are the loveproducts of this unrecognised union and both of them set out upon their exceptional yet representative careers we find it hard to be convinced by the psychology of michael the baby and small boy mr mackenzie probably resembles the rest of us in forgetting his own impressions at the age of two and in attempting to reconstruct the infantile phantasms of reality he is no more successful than he was in carnival or than m rolland was in jean christophe but no sooner has his hero gone to school than he begins to live for us as well as for himself this sinister picture of the foolish satire of masters the fashions and aspirations of small boys the keen zest for work and games and weariness of them the vast absorbing and sometimes hated institutional atmosphere of the school is a more faithful picture of publicschool life than anything we know in english fiction where mr mackenzie perhaps errs is in the emphasis he gives to certain exceptional influences in the life of his hero nearly all schoolboys are extraordinarily sentimental and extraordinarily religious but michael is a theologian many clever schoolboys are in danger of becoming aesthetes whether it be of the george moore or the oscar wilde type but michael outdoes them all nearly all of them are addicted to love affairs and take an interest in questions of sex but michael is more than most boys exposed to the violent surprises of knowledge but if mr mackenzie attends to this question very closely and actually gives it a greater importance than it seems to merit that is because he is attending very closely to all the remarkable influences which may be exerted upon an impressionable and exceptional boy we think that he has considering his whole scheme attempted a task which is rather too large for his philosophy but his characters are alive the school is a veritable hive of bees and drones we recognise it as a characteristic forcing ground of youth undoubtedly mr mackenzie has written a powerful and zestful book which the censor has advertised to the advantage of those whom he has introduced to it,dom

we meet her who developes into a very lovable woman under the influence of a strong passion which she is innocent enough to advertise quite openly we are to judge that this very innocence which allows

bloodless nature has been surprised  you cant help it he tells her now and again nature makes woman a prig and it is only the right man who can regenerate her unfortunately circumstances prevent me from being the right man to do katharine justice she is as much troubled as the reader to discover her claim to the title to her father the most exquisitely irresponsive of audiences she ultimately confides her solution of the enigma  a prig is one who tries to break what the ordinary person is pleased to call the law of nature and to substitute the law of his own reason instead  the world wont tolerate ideals it sneers at us for trying to find out new ways of being good now to get a bad name is to go far towards deserving it and it would certainly seem by this sort of speech that katharine is in a fair way to become the thing which she has been very inaccurately called apart from the conclusion which is not worthy of the rest the novel with its comparatively commonplace incidents yet holds the attention by force of its artless sincerity and general reasonableness it presents a most acceptable study of womans character but while it is perhaps only natural and even proper that miss sharp should understand her own sex better than the other there seems no adequate reason why almost all her men should be intolerable it does not appear that she intended this she wishes her readers to understand that paul wilton is a most fascinating personality yet she altogether fails to convince them that a girl of an intelligence so sane and unspoilt could be enamoured of this objectionable egoist when confessedly there was no physical attraction to recommend him his habitual assumption that he has only to lift his little finger to do what he likes with her makes them against their will

wish to be good in a different way from her neighbours and the result was naturally disappointing she fell out with the man she really worshipped and made a gallant effort to be content with the commonplace in the shape of a boisterous youth called ted but it is written that a prig may repent of his or her ways and yet not be able to turn from them and so at last we find her confirmed in her priggishness and about to marry the first melancholy and epigrammatic lover the tale is a sort of mild satire upon the quest of foolish ideals but the edge of miss sharps weapon is not cruel indeed the iresent writer has never quite found out wherein the priggishness ay and the point in any case is not important the book begins rather lamely but falls soon into the right comedy vein andwith now

certain attractiveness but there is need of more care and strength in the portrayal of men and women before tile work can fully justify itself the rector and miss esther are mere figures of an old fictional convention katharine is better but in her also there is need of a more adequate conception and what shall we say of paul and ted  the one is only sallow cheeks a black beard and a few

knows how to impress on the readers imagination it is the desert heart of the yukon in winter  the great whit1 land broken and torn  and silent a woman and the man she loves are facing the perils of the winter trail trying to reach civilization in time for her child to be born without shame later we have equally striking descriptions of wide cornfields in the heart of canada and it is here the millionaires luxurious home is set the  strong man  is primaeval and rough in character unscrupulous and free in his vengeance as in his generosity at first the greed of gain entirely possesses him  later in life his love for a woman absorbs him as completely the plot though in many respects skilfully constructed is yet at its foundation weak the woman travelling from the yukon is separated from her lover reaches her destination alone and dies soon after the childs birth the story then turns on the promise of her young sister a girl of 17 to bring this boy up as her own and to let it be supposed that he was born in wedlock and that she is a widow that a girl so young loving her unfortunate sister and in thc presence of death should be willing to promise this is conceivable  what seems to us curious is that after eighteen years when she is about to be married she should tell the hoy of his unhappy birth but yet allow him still to believe that she is his mother she thus sacrifices herself to spare her sisters memory and breaks her promise in its essential part upon this much that follows depends and it could only have been made convincing if pity and love for the memory of the dead mother had been shown to have some remaining power but this is not the case there are many complications in which socialism and labour unrest play some part there are also many good situations cleverly handled and several interesting characters besides those mentioned  but on the whole we think the book would have been better had it been shorter the dialogue is in the strong

overtaken by a blizzard while braving the hazard of the winter trail to the coast tlhe party comprises a man a woman and an indian guidle and the cause of this perilous dash for civilisation is an

altogether a pleasant man in spite of his magnificent physique and indomitable will he is in fact a relentless unscrupulous schemer whose one consuming ambition is to force his way by fair means or

fascinated woman who has attached herself to him    i never calculated to marry you    i have no real love to give any woman    my whole mind and body are absorbed in another direction which is utterly opposed to all sentiment the first part of the novel tells how leo abandoned the mother of his child for the sake of a  wad  of gold and how the womran died in childbirth leaving the infant boy to the care of her seventeenyear old sister monica the plot hinges on the solemn pledge which the dying mother extracts from monica the novel spreads over a large number of years and deals largely and critically with the clash between capital and labour capital being epitomised in the person of leo who  makes good  as a wheat king and labour in the person of his son who matures into a socialist

from that magazine of practical everyday wisdom the book of the proverbs  as the door turneth on its hinges so doth the slothful on his bed  the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom  it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth  he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way  a lion is in the streets here the curate paused and sternly demanded of his congregation which of them did not see a lion every day of his life   why he exclaimed  afric is not so infested with lions as ireland is the junior part of the audience looked a little startled at tnis asseveration and billy pitt felt abashed at his fathers ignorance of the natural history of his country but the curate vehemently protested that he affirmed the truth and that he would proclaim from the housetops that all the miseries of ireland were owing to the lions why were the bogs unreclaimed for fear of the lions why were the fields unfilled 1fear of the lions why were the very streets of redcross unpaved and unbesomed because there was a lion in every one of them then he told them that the lion seen by thc slothful is a phantom sent to scare them from their duties by him who is represented as a lion himself aud a roaring lion seeking to devour aud who would eat up the sluggards first of all having thus sufficiently terrified his audience he proceeded to inform them how the lions were to be combated  face them be cried  and they will scamper away like hares i have made lions run in my time so i speak from experience my friends resist the devil and the best way to resist him is to work christianity is the religion of work its divine author was himself a workman its apostles were fishermen and mechanics expressly to teach us that there is nothing so good nothing so holy nothing so godlike as industry as there is nothing so shabby and diabolical as sloth the god of christianity is a god of industry  he took his kings from the sheepfold and his prophets from the plough  this idea led the enthusiastic preacher into a rhapsody which delighted markham the curate broke forth into a glowing panegyric upon rural life with its pastoral and agricultural occupations their calm pleasures their salubrious nature their transcendent usefulness their true dignity how the plough exceeded the sword in gloryhow no foughten field not the memorable fight of the boyne itself which in mr woodwards estimation exceeded all the battles of history in glory is half so illustrious as the field that industry finds a waste and leaves a garden  how the cultivator of the earth is the victor for man to honour how the pagans understood this when they adored the givers of the corn the olive and the vine and how he panted for the day when some greater conqueror than had ever yet appearedgreater than stratford or cromwell or glorious and immortal william himselfwould visit their shores not with the sword to ravage but with wisdom to reclaim and cultivate not to subdue the people but to vanquish their follies and their crimes not to win gory honours by the slaughter of men or the sack of towns but to bind his brows with unbloody and unfading laurels gathered with the sickle not the sword with all  the pomp and circumstance of glorious peace there is another class in ireland we must add who as little escape the rod of uncle hercules but be brings them up for judgement apart from each other  formerly i used to  have them both up together he remarks  but the result  was that each thought himself abnsed merely to humour  the other and besides it was only encouraging the notion  already far too prevalent that the faults of the rich excuse  those of the poor and vice versa high

B3600,"['6713689', '8584519']",  far from thc madding crowd by thomas hardy london smith elder  co 1874 far from the madding crowd is so clever a novel so original in atmosphere and in character that its brilliant qualities are likely to neutralise the glare of its equally prominent faults the writer has the advantage of dealing with an almost untouched side of english life his scene is laid somewhere in the country of mr freemans favourite seaxsaetas in a remote agricultural and pastoral district of southwestern england among peasants who look on bath as a distant and splendid metropolis it is likely that much of the old country existence lives on undisturbed the country folk in the story have not heard of strikes or of mr arch they have to all appearance plenty to eat and warm clothes to wear and when the sheep are shorn in the ancient barn of weatherbury the scene is one that shakespeare or that chaucer might have watched this immobile rural existence is what the novelist has to paint  in comparison with cities he says weatherbury was immutable the citizens then is the rustics now in london twenty or thirty years ago are old times in paris ten years or five in weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present and nothing hiss than a century set a mark on its face or tone five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter the embroidery of a smockfrock by the breadth of a hair ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase in these nooks the busy out aiders ancient times are only old his old times are still new his present is futurity no condition of society could supply though writer who knows it well with a more promising ground for his story the old and the new must meet here and there with curious surprises and our world may find itself face to face with the quaint conceited rustics of shakespeares plays such a story might be written as george sand has often told of the vallee noire sober characters and simple might appear in the foreground of scenes exquisitely quiet and harmonious in our opinion the writer of far from the madding crowd has only partially succeeded in making the best of his theme and though his failure is more valuable than i many successes he has been misled by attempting too much in his way of looking at his subject he rather resembles george eliot than george sand he contemplates his shepherds and rural people with the eye of a philosopher who understands all about them though he is not of them and who can express their dim efforts at rendering what they think and feel in language like that of mr herbert spencer it is this way of writing and thinking that gives though book its peculiar tone the author is telling clever people about unlettered people and he adopts a sort of patronising voice in which there are echoes now of george eliot and now of george meredith thus there aro passages where the manner and the matter jar and are out of keeping there are three circles of interest in this storyfirst the rural surroundings the effects of weather and atmosphere the labours of beasts and men as the lambing of sheep and such mild struggles with natures storms and rains as m victor hugo would scarcely find dramatic enough for his tremendous canvas next there are the minor charactersa sort of chorus of agricultural labourers very ready with advice very helpless and very much taken up with themselves as was the way with the ancient chorus last there are the main persons of the dramathe people in whose passions and adventures the interest ought to centre of these three component parts of the tale the first may bo pronounced nearly perfect and worthy of all praise we might instance the description of norcombe hill by starlight in the beginning of the second chapter as an original and admirable treatment of natureof nature which is more and more tending to become a main interest in our modern fiction we prefer to quote the enumeration of the signs by which the hero detected the approach of a storm because the quotation includes the sheep whose birth and death in this tale are narrated with great minuteness  the sheep were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes and the first peculiarity observable was that on the sudden appearance of oaks head over the fence they did not stir or run away they had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man but this was not the most noteworthy feature they were all grouped in such a way that their tails without a single exception were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened there was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar to which thc clump of furze bushes stood in the relation of the wearers neck  this was enough to reestablish him in his previous opinion he knew now that he was right and troy was wrong every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change but two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions apparently there was to be a thunderstorm and afterwards a cold continuous rain the creeping things seemed to know all about the latter rain but little of the interpolated thunderstorm while the sheep knew all about the thunderstorm and nothing of the latter rain when the thunderstorm bursts it is described with much pictorial effect and is a quite disagreeable enough trial to oak the english gilliat and contender with nature coming from though scenery to the chorus we are a good deal puzzled few men know the agricultural labourer at home and it is possible that ho is what mr hardy describes him the labourers are all humourists in their way which is a very dreary and depressing way odd scraps of a kind of rural euphuism misapplications of scripture and fragments of modern mechanical wit are stirred up into a queer mixture which makes the talk of henery fray cainy ball jan coggan and especially of that preeminent bore joseph poorgrass do labourers really converse like this  i look round upon life quite promiscous do you conceive me neighbours  my words though made as simple as i can nmy be rather deep tor some heads   oh yes henery we quite conceive ye  a strange old piece goodmenwhirled about from here to yonder as if i were nothing worth a little warped too but i have my depths ha and even my great depths i might close with a certain shepherd brain to brain but no oh no hero is another specimen of rural speech   for a drunk of really a noble class and on the highest principles that brought you no nearer to the dark man than you were afore you began there was none like these in farmer everdenes kitchen not a single damn allowed no not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there would have been a great relief to a merry soul   true said the maltster  nature requires her swearing at the regular times or shes not herself and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life and so on shepherds may talk in this way we hope not but if they do it is a revelation and if they dont it is nonsense and not very amusing nonsense leaving the servants and coming to their master and mistress we cannot say that wo are greatly fascinated with the persons or much concerned in their fortunes nothing could be more true or more careful than the study of troy the handsome sergeant with his half education his selfishness his love which he only finds out to be something like true love under the influence of remorse when the soldier erects a costly tomb to the woman whose heart he has broken and plants flowers on her grave in such a way as to wound to the quick the woman he has married we recognise an insight and a touch like that of flaubert but we cannot easily pardon bathsheba the heroine for losing her heart to troys flattery and to the glitter of his brass and scarlet indeed we have some difficulty in being much moved by bathshebas character and mischances when wo first see her she is stealing a look at herself in a mirror unconscious of the presence of young farmer oak when she hears that oak has asked her aunt for leave to court her and has been discouraged she runs after the exemplary man and explains that she is heart free then she sends a valentine with a seal marry me to farmer boldwood and so fascinates that apparently calm but really passionate rustic meanwhile oak fails as a farmer and bathsheba having become a farmer in ber own right takes him on as shepherd and has  curiously confidential passages with him at last the gay sergeant fixes her fancy with a display of swordsmanship and sho drives alone at night to bath and is married to him we feel inclined to say to her as mr buckstone does to galatea in the play  youre sure its innocence   the young ladys misfortunes deepen as troy spends her money and takes to drinking thero is a very powerful and strange scene between them when she opens the coffin of her dead rival fanny robin and her husband kisses the lips of the corpse and tells his wife that he only loved the dead it is a situation worthy of the drama of webster or of ford and wild as it is is lcd up to in a perfectly natural way this part of the tale including fanny robins terrible walk to her rest in the workhouse is ominently tragic and is not improved by the commonplace tragedy of the denouement we leave bathsheba wedded to the worthy oak a capital overseer and a husband who may be trusted we hope the babies were  put in the papers every man jack of them as mr oak promised when ho wooed bathsheba is so seldom on though level that her troubles with her husband raise her to that wc feel she does not decline on oak and have no sense of her as wasting her sweetness it is unlikely that even her remorso for having tempted boldwood would lead her into her foolish latter relations with such a man and on the whole we cannot look on bathsheba as a firmly designed character in spite of this want of success and of incongruities of tone tyar from the madding crowd displays undeniable talent which has scarcely as yet found its best and easiest and most natural expression in taking leave of an interesting provoking and clever story we must say a word in praise of though graceful illustrations a lang  far from the maddlng crowd far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy author of  a pair of blue eyes smith elder and co without making minute comparisons between mr hardy and any of his contemporary novelists let it suffice to say that this last work of his at once lifts his name above the crowd and gives him a position among the eminent few which it rests with himself to confirm or to diminish mr hardy is not a novelist to whom the exercise of his art is a bywork or a recreation it is clear that he has given his best energies to its service and has worked with faithful and patient zeal for his reward it is pleasing to meet with work that is so obviously the outcome of high aims and one should not be grudging in expressing ones conviction of the artists thorough success far from the madding crowd is not mr hardys first novel but it is so much more mature and powerful in every way than his earlier efforts that in them he seems rather to have been exercising himself with a view to obtaining a command of his materials this is particularly true of under the greenwood tree published some two years ago which the author called  a rural painting of the dutch school and in which he depicted rural life in an english county with the most loving minuteness and intimate fidelity of detail  a pair of blue eyes mr hardys next effort was not so exclusively pictorial it was a study of a more tragic kind with more complex characters and a more stirring plot but the evolution was none the less deliberate and every situation was worked out with the same painstaking and searching method both under the greenwood tree and a pair of blue eyes are very remarkable novels which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation and pictorial and narrative power of the writer but far from the madding crowd is not only an advance upon them in freedom and firmness of handling but it excels them also in concentration of interest and in spacious breadth and solid truth of proportion when the first chapters of  far from the madding crowd appeared in the cornthill magazbine a supposition was started that this must be a new novel by george eliot and the point was very generally discussed indeed if those chapters stood by themselves as a fragment of unknown authorship no conjecture could be more plausible they deal with the kind of life that george eliot has more than once chosen to describe to which in fact she has almost acquired a prescriptive right and the opening description of farmer oak is a portrait very much in her manner if the critic cared to go into minute corroborations of such distinguished parentage he would find them in the incidents of bathshebas unpacking the mirror and taking a survey of her beauty while waiting on the top of the cart and her higgling over twopence with the tollkeeper these little incidents have a delicate spice of malicious truth to nature which one often finds in george eliots pictures at the same time if we had read mr hardys previous novels we need have had no difficulty in tracing the authorship of  far from the madding crowd for mr hardys style is his own and sufficiently distinctive to be easily recognised one might mistake a detached portion of his work for george eliots but when it is viewed as a whole it has a good many striking points of difference mr hardy is not such a master of language as george eliot his style has not the same freshness nor the same eloquence and momentum and this difference of style goes along with a more deeplyseated difference of matter mr hardy is much less of a preacher than george eliot his interests are more exclusively dramatic he is absorbed in delineating character and tracing the workings of passion by minute touches and does not withdraw from his dramatic work to deliver his soul of pentup reflections with all george eliots impartiality towards her creations and her desire to represent each ones life truly as it is nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice the heart of the preacher is to be detected in her choice of subjects her characters derive a large part of their interest from their opinions and views of life now the drama in mr hardys novels is in no sense a warfare of opinions or ideas it is a warfare of persons persons moved by the primaeval motives of love and jealousy far from the madding crowd is concerned with no deeper mysteries than womens hearts and how they are lost and won its story lies in country fields and farmhouses and occupies itself solely with the secular and social life of the inhabitants whether we regard this as a merit or a defect or a matter of indifference depends entirely on our conceptions of art and its functions but if we hold no dogma concern  ing the functions of art and approach mr hardys novel simply as a drama willing to believe that it need not be frivolous because it has no great lesson to teach it is impossible not to recognise the novelists power the plot of far from the madding crowd is of the simplest kind mr hardys art does not lie in the multiplication and complication of incidents but in the searching and complete way in which he traces the effect of each incident upon the thoughts and feelings of his personages the central figure all through is bathsheba everdenea marvellously welldrawn and difficult heroine who unites ha iunlits of her biblical namesake to an inner nature  is     i ius maut vl inne fak curiously compounded of shrewdness strongmined irankness and courage and decorous imperious wayward womanliness the two little incidents that occur on her first introduction to us her satisfied selfinspection in the mirror and her obstinate refusal to give the toilkeeper what he askedat once give us the clue to two sides of her character the novel may be viewed as a history of a struggle between impulsive womanliness and worldly good sense all bathshebas troubles coming from her beauty and consequent waywardness and vanity and the rectification coming from the homelier side when we first see her she is on her way to live with an aunt in whose neighbourhood lives a shepherd farmer named gabriel oak oak was a sturdy capable fellow neither ugly nor particularly welllooking who had raised himself by thrift sobriety and superior knowledge of his work from being a common shepherd to having a farm of his own he naturally fell in love with bathsheba and the account of h1i drein before going througlh the momentous ceremony of making a

B4920,"['8935922', '3149151']",  angling sketches by andrew lang long mans  co few forms of literature are so hackneyed or apt to be so monotonous as descriptions of fishing experienced readers know at once what to expect when the tale begins as enormous fish are invariably captured perhaps such legends encourage the unwary and unskilful but a good angling essay like a days fishing is usually marked by moderation and mr lang is too experienced both in writing and fishing to exaggerate his performances all th achievements ho relates might have fallen to the lot of any ordinary angler while the style in which he describes his varied luck at the riverside is in commendable contrast to the language used by most porting writers many of the phrases which he here employs are characteristic of him happiness in fishing he says is  the legacy of the barbarian fishing brings annual delights for grey hairs come and stiff limbs and shortened sight but though spring is green and hope is fresh for all the changes in the world and in ourselves once more  the grass of parnassus grew thick and white around me with its moonlight tint of green in the veins an atmosphere of poetry old song and ballad

rises to the wellremembered luro with the alacrity of any freshrun tweed salmon there is no need to be a fisherman to enjoy this book whilo the angler may note judgement and experience and stores of piscatorial learning though ordinary roader finds pleasant banter and picturesque description even the philosopher is invited to solve a couple of scotch ghost stories which aro not only novel but uncommon the burns that run by though borders aro charmingly described waters haunted by old legends musical with old songs and renowned in the sporting ossays of christopher north and stoddart a chapter devoted to loch awe terminates in a capital story told though author by his boatman called  the black officer scott however whom little escaped in such matters had previously employed it or a kindred eton and mr lang is pleased to find it alluded to in the recently published diary of sir walter tho bloody doctor forms another chapter noticeable for all mr langs felicity of phraso and playful allusion it is a fine study too from an angling point of view mr burn murdochs illustrations lend a further charm to this charming little volume every one will bo glad of his sketches by tweedside whilo his three otchings are delightful an exacting critic might quarrel with mr langs opening chapter  the confessions of a duffer no one with any pretence to bo a fisherman save our old friend scholasticas could possibly mako so many mistakes the delicate literary touch of the author is somewhat lacking hero nor can a grayling fisher agree that this fish is  though deadesthearted and the foolishestheaded fish that swims it does not indeed emulato the vivid rush and protracted struggles of a trout but when in condition a grayling is no mean antagonist its tactics are rather to curve itself and suffer the sweep of the current to tear though hook from its hold mr lang cannot have forgotten waltons delight inthe grayling  though french say he feeds on gold  some think that he feeds on water thymo  though father of anglers opines that he smells like violets when first caught while st ambrose the glorious bishop of milan calls him the flower fish a good deal has been written on scotch loch fishing but the author manages to compress much piscatorial wisdom respecting it into one of these sketches it is always difficult to know what weather to choose but mr langs estimate is worthy of solon sunshine is bad a north wind worse and no wind at all usually means an empty basket though paper on loch leven is carefully written and will please all who detest though angling competitions of which it is too frequently the scono it is amazing that scotchmen with their innate love of the beautiful and their almost poetic devotion to fishing amid the scenery of their own land can stoop to fish for flasks and medals and pewter pots and that in front of queen marys castlo on loch leven ave entirely agroo with though authors views on salmon fishing  i doubt if except in throwing a very long line and knowing the waters by old experience thero is very much skill in salmon fishing it is all an affair of muscle and patience the choice of flies is almost a pure accident every one believes in the fly with which he has been successful these strange combinations of blues reds golds of tinsel and worsted of feathers and fur aro purely fantastical articles nobody knows why salmon rise at them  nobody knows why they will bite on one day and not on another or rather on many others it is not even settled whether we should use a bright fly on a bright day and a dark fly on a dark day as dr hamilton advises or reverse though choice as others use who that has waded in though tweed but will hoartily echo mr langs account of it  beyond other rivers except perhaps though till it abounds with pitfalls for though unwary and fishermen in it should always bear in mind the canny  nativo proverb  dinna wade deeper than ye can see yet thousands of pounds are annually paid for though right to face these perils you have to jdungo waist deep or deeper into roaring torrents and if the water bo at all drumly you havo not an idea where your next step may fall it may be on a

have to cast painfully with steep precipitous  banks behind you all overgrown with trees with bracken with bramble the small of the back i aches and it is literally in the sweat of your brow i that you take your diversion i enough has been said to show general readers as well as fishermen that this pretty volume contains something for all tastes it is refreshing for the lover of pure english to take up mr langs work and contrast it with so much of the sporting writingit cannot i bo called literatureof the day he has succeeded in many studies but in none has he met with a moro congenial subject or j treated it in a more felicitous manner than j in these angling sketches theyareseldom j forced and are usually thrown off with as  light a hand as that with which though author  would drop a dry fly to a greedy trout in  the test every angler on closing this j book will sincerely trust that the author i will write again  angling sketches these sketches are for the delight and consolation of those who angle unsuccessfully or not at all this is not a volume of the  badminton library father izsak had far more to say concerning the habits of fish and the science of catching them his  little merriment  is only thrown in as a flavour stoddart too the veteran of tweedside gravely discussed the identity of the finnock and the orangefin smelt the effects of transplanting trout and such like weighty questions and put his sentiment and his merriment in orthodox fashion into verse mr lang does otherwise and less for which nonanglers will feel grateful it is enough for him if he speaks technically of the difficulties to be met with in a particular loch or bum for the discouragement of the crowd of cockneys that people quiet places with their unwelcome company he says he is a  duffer perhapswe do not knowhe speaks truly in spite of walton and stoddart there is always a danger of success proving too absorbing and had his pannier been heavier he might have had less time for the fine superfluities of the craft that lend the charm to these present  sketches the boatmans legends the memories of a border boyhood the light out of other days by lochleven side and yarrow the personal contests with stubborn sly and unaccountable fishy nature the consciousness of distance from fleet street and kensington have been their inspirtions ad have been given bright and fitting expreson as to the narratives we feel bound to say we resent the intrusion of  the double alibi we expect whatever mr lang writes to have a literary flavour but even on an upoesional angling expedition we have little interest in the trouble caused by a theocritus on blue paper bound by longpie even though the victim of that treasure did retire to fish in loch nan and live in a whisky still we prefer the hideous the sublime ungallantry of the lady or the salmon in descriptions of nature mr lang skilful as he is could probably never be a master he has too good a memory too appreciative too welleducated a mind scott or some one else would always be whispering something in his ear and there is a certain literary consciousness which is never long enough absent the poems of hogg must serve as a flybook but we say this not as a reproach to these pages and pictures for they are a real incentive to idlenessand what better could be said and must charm all be they anglers or not who are wooers of the wesr wind watchers of the april momn,dom

B1845,"['9453922', '4854836', '4373330']",  crumbs from a sportsmans table by charles clarke 2 vols chapman  hall a medley of sketches gathered from a popular sporting magazine and of disconnected trifles about horses and their riders crumbs from a sportsmans table is a lively scrapbook containing things that are good and suggesting things that are better some of the coverside sketches are spirited and truthful  our county member is a very good portrait the chapter entitled  parson heathfield is tainted with the modern sportsmans cant which likes to credit hunting and shooting clergymen with a superabundance of christian charity and zeal having told how the parson stopped short at the most exciting crisis of a good run and pulled out of deep water a young gentleman who was sinking for the last time mr clarke exclaims enthusiastically now thats what i call charity and he will be rewarded for it though he lost the run what would the author have called it if parson heathfield for the sake of another ten minutes of keen enjoyment had left jemmy allcroft ba of trinity college oxford to die in the brook  if heaven can be won by such trifling acts of selfsacrifice there is not much truth in the adage which teaches that the thing which is earned without trouble is never of much value but though the reader smiles at mr clarkes anxiety to canonise parson heathfield he applauds the humour which makes the worthy rector say to his curate  choose your daysthree a fortnight and all i can say is this if you do your work as well across country as you do in my village you will take a good deal of beating andstay one moment allcroftdont go out any more in trousers if hunting is wrong for us its just as wrong in a pair of cord trousers as it is in leather breeches you will never lose the respect of yourself or other people by propriety of costume whatever your business and if a man wears a pair of trousers only to cover his inclinations he might as well be without them the sketch of dick crupperton  the gentleman dealer who makes his hunters pay for themselves is excellent on turning away from this gentleman the author observes  as dick gets older and the family increases of course the stud must decrease for amateur dealing requires a great deal of personal activity to make it pay you must look up customers and you mubt feed them  and though you may continue to buy a good sort you must buy them in the proper market and ride them well when once crupperton becomes a good sportsman and ceases to be a good riderwhen once he prefers to go through a gate to going over ithe must give up all idea of the stud paying its expenses it is quite true that these masters will not take their hounds home for him an honour several times threatened and once conferred upon him but he will have more friends if his acquaintances are fewer some of mr clarkes pieces are deficient in originality for instance the life of hunter an autobiography contains nothing new either in aim or treatment the same criticism applies to a very military examination  rotten bow also is an unsatisfactory essay  but on the other hand the  page from the diary of an impostor is a capital piece of fun broad in humour and yet delicately handled as a sporting writer mr clarke would be a far more agreeable companion if he were to cure himself of two reprehensible tendencies he says far too much about the millinery and upholstery of the field the polish of boots and the bloom of tops the merits of the tailors and the art of hatters costume in the field is a matter that well deserves consideration  but we dont want much noise to be made about it again like nearly all writers of books for sportsmen mr clarke delights to show bis knowledge of the latin books used by schoolboys he ought to get the better of this habit of quotation which it may be observed does not mark him quite so strongly as some of his contemporaries the usage is indefensible with less educated readers it serves no good purpose to scholars it is ridiculous  crumbs from a sportsmans table crumbsfrom a sportemans table by charie clarke author of  which is the wind i c c chapman  hall unting or

desird  but what every one must look upon as essentallyrue is the monetary portion of harry fanshawes character to which we are commonplae enough to ascribe the chief portion of his sueesses gold covers a multitude of sins and no doubt if he had proposed to hunt his own fox as the pauthor say not a soul would have said him nay the question respecting wht are commonly called foxhunting parsons is rather a vexed one the authors description of parson heathfield and his defence of the practice of hunting amongst clergymen requires therefore a little consideration we are prepared at the outset to look somewhat more clemently upon the case not from the arguments which are here brought to bear upon it but from our own individual ideas upon this subject the character of parson heathfield is one which is by no means a rare one  if the pleasures of the chase were confined to such as him and to those of the cloth who enjoyed like incomes we contend there would be nothing reprehensible the 1am nimcfkn cnot as to the propriety of the action itself but as to whether the indulgence of such pastimes does not in a measure prevent the engager in them from performing the duties of his sacred office we cannot forone moment imagine that any one would be so narrowminded or bigoted as to say that the driving of a pony carriage the recreation of fishing or a game of cricket are engagements whih should be denied to the clergyman for these pleasures are within the scope of almost any ones means and are  not such as to wean his thoughts from graverk and more responsible duties the mens sacwxwill not come without the core sano  d prondod other 4uties are no neglectd  the caeih no har mu i these huntig is a otbr question we contend that parson heatihfied in the enjoyment of the income the author allots to him had a right to hunt three days a fortnight for he could afford to keep a curate to assist him  added to hich we are not rery certiain that in a county like leicestershire where every one hunts the presence of the parson is not only beneficial but an opening of the door to many a mans hearti who would not otherwise listen be that as it may the adthors  sketch of parson heathfield is one deserving of grteat merit and wa cordially reecho his exclabation when alluding to the prejudices of certain persons who would deny the cler every participation in the amusements of the world he says oh you old paasees just wash your own platters the waters of the wissendine are not the only things that soil the chastity of  the cloth the descriptions of the gentleman dealer and the london division are both true and ludicrous in alluding to the debut of mr peter scripp the  london stockbroker who suffered from a torpid liver and imagined that hinting and country air were the sole panacea for his co la hint which xua be said to be the d t ever given to a man purposing tobuy a h w knows nothing about one instead of fraternizing with isome horsey individual who weas tight

eveide skethes or part i of crumbs from a sportsmans ablo by a pleasant amusing description of leamington and its attractions we cannot however endorse the sort of universal censure he passes upon the men who hunt from the spa we conclude it must be some little time ago since the author visited it and that when there he had some unfortunate rencontre which left an unfavourable impression upon his  mind leamington has produced and still produces some ofi the best men that ever rode to a coverside who go straight never crane or override hounds and invariably ride a line of their own the closing chapter on ladies and their habits we would strongly recommend to those of our fair readers who purpose ever to make a debut in the huntingoeld we leave this portion of the work with a regret which is somewhat alleviated by the cintents of part ii the first portion of this is devoted to the 1 life of 0unter an autobiography we seldom recollect seeing so much useful information given upon the bringing up of a young horse his education for the huntingfield and stable management than is here clearly and judiciously pointed out there is however a manifest indiscretion not only in this portion of the work but pervading tne two volumes which we are sorry to see we allude to the very disparaging way in which the author speaks of military men in connexon with horses hounds and hunting many of our very best judges and mfhs were and are still military men the army has ever been a good school for the bringing out of good material no doubt the young sub on joming gives himself airs and graces yet like a boy fresh from home on going o a public school this sort of nonsense is soon taken out of him and he acquires knowledge from the best of all monitors cc experience the advice of the vet in page 271 to the master is one which we shoulk like to see more generally attended to a horse sudffering from a bad cough and cold is injudiciously physicked  by his groom the vet in speaking to the master says the disease is quite lowering enough without taking away the little strength theyve got left just keep your eye on your own stableseo ent when you likeride em when you likebut 0 ont give up the reins if every master did this they would find themselves better off in pocket and horses than by trusting to their headgrooms many of the other subjects contained in volume 2 having appeared in baileys and other magazines it is almost unnecessary to comment upon them with the exception of the cosing chapter the history of the pytcheleyhunt the reminiscenceswof this truly to the foxhunters sporting county show a careful study of his subject together with an immense facility of memory we quite agree with the author respecting the game coverts especially that on braunston hill and we trust that the authors remarks may not be thrown away upon those who have the disposal and outlay of the 18001 per annumn which is yearly expended to keep these coverts up in conclusion the hunting com3munity especiaely those who can afford to revel in a glorious burst over our midland counties ought not lightly to feel the debt of oblgation they are under to the author for thii last bittruly not the least addition to the sporting ibrar  crumbs from a sportsmans tablr we have here a series of graphic sketches and anecdotes of hunting written in a lively and agreeable style which never oversteps the bounds of good taste and cannot fail to prove amusing to those lovers of the noble sport who though heroes in the field are  fond of light reading and prefer the entrees and sidedishes on the table of literature to a piece de resistance in the shape of history or philosophy the first volume contains thirteen chapters entitled  coverside sketches the headings of whichas our county member  a popular man  parson heatbfield the gentleman dealer  the professional dealer  of funkers and their habits cwill give our readers some idea of the nature of their contents and taken in conjunction with the following quotation will enalle them to judge how far the fare provided is suited to their taste  the heathfields of leathfield are of a very great family i mean one of our fine

commoners who come together about halfpast eleven and separate about two the stewards having done their duty by paying for the music in such a convocation the heathfields are perfectly at home they know everybody can afford to be even familiar with the squirarchy and positively kind to the inferior clergy in fact it was is and always has been a very charming family and if that were all we had to say about it we might dismiss the subject in a very few words but the heathfields of heatbfield have higher claims on the historian they have peculiarities not appertaining to all mendistinguishing ma ks of hereditary pride deserving a niche in the temple of fame the family hasl always afforded a member for te county a parson for the rectory of heat hfidld and a fox from the family gorse since the time of the rump now a member of parliament is common enough and we might not have stepped aside to exhibit the pcrtrait of anything so vulgar bat a reverend gilbert heathfield rector of heathfield a county magistrate chairman of the union a firstrate shot and the quickest man for twenty minutes on his own side of the county is not to be treated thus lightly the second volume under the title of  roadside scrapings at home and abroad is mainly made up of light sketches of a similar character in one chapter headed  the prince of wales as a sportsman however something more than mere amusement has been aimed at to those who would deprecate the patronage of the turf by his royal highnesq our author replies that it is surely no compliment to the prince to tell him that he is so deficient in strength as to fall a prey to the temptations which thousands withstand or to bid him avoid a duty because it is hampered with certain perils to the courteous the weak or the selfindulgent and he then earnestly insists upon the great benefit the turf might derive from the influence and example of the heirapparent it exerted in a direction calculated to cleanse and purify this institution which has doubtless contributed so much to our national preeminence in horseflesh by far the most interesting chapter in the book however is the last the history of the pytchley hunt  from family mss in  crumbs

qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage becomes transparent in the opening chapters to all resent and to come therefore be it known that porthgenna tower with the premises adjoining is the tomb aud temple of n great family mystery captain and mrs trevertonthe former the lord of lands and monies the latter the daughter of an actress have there their local habitation  with them resides their only child rosamond mrs trevertons servant is called sarah leeson and in the first scene this woman is summoned to the deathbed of her mistress she is compelled by her domestic allegiance to write a letter to her master which the wife signs anil the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when

knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to

time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me

right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss

bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the

B8335,['8714325'],  tiue cossacks a tale of the caucasus in 1852  by count leo tolstoy translated from the russian by eugene schuyler new york scribners count tolstoys story of  the cossacks contains a number of striking pictures of unfamiliar scenes peopled by strange inhabitants it is easy to believe that the work has gained a great popularity in russia readers who are as little acquainted as most russians are with mountains must ever find a special charm in descriptions of such scenery as the caucasus can offer especially when the describer is so skilled a literary artist as count tolstoy in the time of the emperor nicholas moreover the caucasus possessed a special attraction for russian minds derived from the contrast between the wild free life led there and the tameness of existence at home under a paternal despotism this contrast became less striking after the complete subjugation of the caucasus and the relaxation in russia of the bonds by which until the accession of alexander ii the russians serfowners as well as serfs were bound but in 1852 the date of the incidents related in count tolstoys novel it was still in full force the comparison he has drawn however is between the artificial and purposeless life led by russians of the upper class and the simple natural life not of the mohallamedan mountaineers but of their christian neighbours the grebna cossacks the descendants of a colony of  old believers who fled from russia centuries ago the contrast between the two forms of existence is impressed upon the readers attention by means of the effect which it produces upon the mind of the hero of the story an impulsive young russian of the upper class who suddenly gives up the frivolous life he has been leading at oscow and enrols himself as a cadet in the army of the caucasus before reaching his destination his mind is full of ideas of  amalat beks circassian girls mountains precipices fearful torrents and dangers when he gets there he finds that these are not the characteristics of the part of the country in which he is quartered the mountains indeed are near enough to form a noble background to the picture and the mountaineers are to be found and fought with during the expeditions which take place from time to time but what daily meets his eyes and influences his thoughts is the simple vigorous life of the cossacks among whom he is thrown and with whom he sometimes feels inclined to spend the rest of his days  here there are no darkbrown steeds or precipices or amalat beks or heroes and villains he thought people live as nature lives they die and are born get married others are born they 6ght drink eat enjoy themselves and die and there are no special conditions except those unchangeable ones which nature has set to the sun the grass to animals and trees other laws they do not have and for that reason these people in comparison with himself seemed excellent strong and free and when he looked at them he felt ashamed and sad these people whom olenin admires so much are by no means inclined to look upon ordinary russians with favour regarding them indeed as mere contemptible tobacco smokers and he at first finds himself isolated in the village in which he is quartered after a time however he makes friends with a few individuals who are chosen by the author as representatives of certain cossack types one is the wily hardy drunken old sportsman eroshka another is the reckless dashing conceited young jiqit or bravo lukashka but the most interesting of his new acquaintances is marianka the daughter of the cossack cornet in whose house he lodgesa maiden whose flashing eyes and wild looks and lithe form discernible within the pink shirt which constitutes the whole of her indoor costume soon produce a great effect upon the impressionable heart of the russian visitor at first however he gives himself up entirely to the attractions of the chase being introduced by uncle eroshka to the neighbouring forests in which he finds numbers of pheasants wild boars and deer thegnats are still more numerous but olenin soon becomes accustomed to them it even seemed to him that if there were not this atmosphere of gnats surrounding him on all sides this paste of gnats which rolled up under hid hands or his sweaty face and this itching over his whole body the forest would have lost fur him its character and its charm to lukashka he gives a horse thereby winning the goodwill but exciting the suspicions of that dashing young hero whose remarkable exploit of shooting an abrek who is swimming across the river is rewarded with a cross by the government and at first he takes a brotherly interest in lukashkas courtship of marianka but he sooiis finds himself constantly following her about with looks of more than fraternal fondness he delighted in seeing how freely and gracefully she bent over how her pink shut which was her only clothing draped itself over her breast and along her muscular legs howl when she straightened herself lip the outilinies of her heaving bosom were strongly marked under her tightly drawn shirt how her narrcw feet shod in old red slippers stood firmly on the ground without losing their form how her strong armts with tleeves rolled up straining the muscles angrily aeo it were threw the hoe and how her deep black eyes looked sometimes at him one of his fellowofficers invites the girls of the village to a party at his quarters and there olenin meets marianka and kisses her kissing being a custom of the country and soon begins to think of nothing else but her wild fascinating beauty she and lukashka become betrothed lovers but yet olenin cannot refrain from constantly watching her as she plucks the ripe clusters of grapes at the vintage follows the cattle afield or unharnesses them in the twilight or wanders by moonlight around the courtyard and garden at length one evening when he finds himself alone with her  senselessly tender words  flow fast from his lips  of themselves without any control or volition of his and he asks her to marry him but what shall we do with lukashka she answers and then flies barefooted from his embrace the next evening when he renews his suit declaring that he will enrol himself among the cossacks and settle down in the village and live there all his days if only she will be his wife she listens quietly to his ardent speeches and when he asks her do you love me tell me for gods sake  she replies  why should i not love you  you are not crooked and then laughing and pressing his hand with her firm and muscular fingers she goes on to say how white bow very soft and white your hands are  just like clotted cream   the next day olenin intends to make a formal proposal for her band and to let all the village know that marianka has accepted him but he finds an unusual excitement in the street and learns that several circassians have been found concealed in the reeds not far from the station and that the cossacks are setting out to attack them he accompanies the party although it is plain that his presence is not desired and so he is enabled to witness the heroism of lukashka and his companions they push before them a cart laden with bay and from behind it shoot at the mountaineers wvho knowing they cannot escape have tied themselves together with straps knee to knee and have begun to sing their death song the cossacks succeed in killing them all but lukasbka is severely wounded after his return to the village olenin seeks marianka and finds her alone in the cellar with tears in her eyes he asks what is the matter with her and she replies in a hoarse and deep voice that they have been killing cossacks that is what is the matter he asks whether she means lukashka and she replies  go away i dont want you  and on his expostulating she brings his courtship abruptly to an end go away you hateful man  cried the girl stamping on the ground and moving towards him with a threatening look such disgust hatred and anger were expressed on her face that olenin suddenly understood that he had nothing to hope for so he takes a final farewell of the village eroshka weeps over him drinks freely at his expense and asks and obtains a gun as a parting gift when his carriage drives off olenin turns round to take his last glance at the home he is quitting uncle eroshka was talking with marianka evidently about his own affairs and neither the old man nor the girl paid the slightest attention to him and so the story ends it is to be pro sumed that marianka married lukasbka who made her work for him and beat her whenever he was drunkthat is to say frequently mr schuyler says in his preface that he hopes his translation  may contribute its little to the better knowledge and understanding not only of the russians but of the most maligned and misunderstood portion of themthe cossacks in this it may succeed though it is not very likely to convey to english readers a very favourable impression of cossack life the cossacks as depicted by count tolstoy seem to have few merits beyond those of good looks courage and independence but the author deserves all the more credit for having described those children of nature as they really are if it were only for this reason the work for an acquaintance with which we are indebted to m1r schuyler would deserve to be studied but it deals

B5653,"['8831810', '6655091', '3180846']",  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen  co realism is so often an excuse for immorality in what is called art that one can gladly praise mr arthur morrison for a realism which deals frankly with dirt brutality and crime his story is without plot a mere straightforward chronicle of a mt of life in the lowest class at the eastend of london it is told with great vigour and with powerful simplicity the author must no doubt seem to many to dwell too minutely upon details of fighting and to be tempted at times into exaggeration in the following horrible account of an affray between women the reader can hardly fail to mark the zest of the narrator norah walsh vanquished champion now somewhat recovered looked from a window saw her enemy vulnerable and ran out armed with a bottle she stopped at the kerb to knock the bottom off the bottle and then with an exultant shout seized sally green by the hair and stabbed her about the face with the jagged points blinded with blood sally released her hold on mrs perrott and rolled on her back struggling fiercely  but to no end for norah walsh kneeling on her breast stabbed and stabbed again till pieces of the bottle broke away the human frame can bear a great deal but if this description is taken literally it is pretty clear that sally must have been killed on the spot at another place it is said that a constable was laid low by a firegrate adroitly let drop from an upper window laid low may of course mean killed but if so the author for once fails to choose the plainest word if it does not the exaggeration is palpable many pages are devoted to elaborate accounts of free fights and one chapter describing a single combat furnishes the most disgusting passages in the book what is the object of it all those who have to pass their time in police courts or in the central criminal court know very well that villainy such as mr morrison depicts and worse exists in london the clergy of all denominations the officers of the chanty organisation society mr waughs society for protecting children and other societies and many philanthropists who work in the eastend have certainly not uah remiss in letting the world know what jsj on in places like the jago mr sorrison has nothing new to tell he is lycastic about the philanthropists who surely do not deserve his sarcasm if his aim is to beguile novelreaders into taking interest in the slums it is not to be commended the facts are known attempts have been made to attack the evils by rousing excited sentiment better directed efforts are not wanting and those who are in earnest must deplore the method of the novelist who dwells upon revolting details of blood and blows if the example of dickens is pleaded as a precedent it must he remembered that dickens went straight to a definite point and had something to reveal with mr morrison it is not so fortunately there is one bright spot in his pages he sincerely admires his father gturt who labours without much success hut with fine courage and perseverance the dedication of the book to mr jay the vicar of holy trinity shoreditch suggests an explanation of the word  jago  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen mr arthur morrison has drawn upon fresh material for this powerful and unequal story it is a steep desoent from the mean streets to the jago one to be indicated by a considerable deepening of the tints upon that lurid map of mr charles booths it means all the difference between respectability as an ideal rarely attained to and respectability as the memory of an ideal long ago forsaken for in the jago for one hundred years the blackest pit in london you touch the very bottom of the social scale the ultimate dregs and offscourings of humanity dealing thus as it now does with the extremes of filth and rapacity and cruelty mr morrisons style has dropped something of its old effectiveness powerful it is still and grimly humorous and scrupulously faithful but the quality of tragic restraint so noticeable in the earlier book has hardly fair play among conditions where the sheerest fidelity of expression can only read like extravagance tragedy indeed is wellnigh impossible in the jago for want of that conflict between good and evil out of which tragedy essentially springs there is no good at these levels to count for anything we are bound to say that we think there are passages in mr morrisons book where the brutality exceeds the limits of art the account for instance of the street fight between sally green and norah walsh is a thing which like certain scenes in le debdcle and one or two exceptional stories of mr kiplings stirs not the imagination but the gorge nevertheless it is in many ways a book of extraordinary merit for the remorseless vigour of the descriptions and for the dramatic power with which the writer has conceived entered into and maintained throughout the jago point of view to put this squalid record of robbery and murder as they are side by side with the fagin and bill sykes scenes in oliver twist is to get an object lesson on the difference between the realistic and the romantic conceptions of fiction mr morrisons genius we think is rather for the episodic than for the epic the book would have held together better if attention had been concentrated throughout upon dicky perrott who is admirably done and not divided as it is at the end between him and his villainous father mr weech the   fence who narks  and gets the reward of a  nark is a creation conscious that his picture is lacking in high lights he has introduced an heroic parson the rev henry sturt but the rev henry sturt has as little to do in the book as he was able to do in the jago and his real function seems to be to afford an opportunity for mr morrison to express his preference for the methods of the church in the slums over those of general booth or of toynbee hall  a child of the jago0   people are so very genteel arent they     but hang it all men like ourselves neednt talk as though the world was built of hardbake its a mighty relief to speak truth with a man who knowsa man not rotted through with sentiment by the mouth of the jago surgeon mr morrison has expressed his own attitude the mild sugary speech of philanthropists the comfortable complacency of westend slummers the blind absurd enthusiasm that looks to make the eastend into paradise by culturehe turns and rends them all for he knows that they have not seen have not dared to see the black slough of sin and cruelty and unspeakable wrong that lies beyond their efforts and their courage woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing  because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered mortar say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye 0 great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it it is an attitude only tolerable to the courageous it is a knowledge that would kill if it were forced on the feeble but the attitude and the knowledge must be a part of any true understanding of the world as it is made it is a recognition of a state of things desperate but not entirely hopeless he gives us dicky a young thief a man of the world an evil world at ten yet staunch spirited responsible and he sends father sturt in our way probably to show the kind of temper that has any chance of redeeming the dwellers in such a place of crime and misery sturt has no illusions he knows the worst of the district he has tenacity courage a keen sense of humour and cannot be humbugged it is no use paying mr morrison compliments at this time of day on his vigour and his unusual ability these must be everywhere acknowledged they are acknowledged by us very heartily but this new book of his has pages which it is almost impossible to read we do not combat his general attitude at all he does not pretend to tell the whole tale of eastend misery which has its genteel sides of course but he tells one awful chapter of it and we respect his sense of responsibility in doing so however much he shatters our complacency and our shallow convictions that alls right with the world we do not accuse him of exaggeration and as to his excesses of realism we can at least understand the temptation but to understand does not take away the right of protest and we do protest against the useless riot of brutality the orgies of physical violence which we are made witnesses of if we read the book through zola has never outdone some of the pages here in their horrible defiance of any sensitive feelings we may have but we declare our right to have these feelings respected if not pampered and our opinion that an unblinking perusal of these tales of brutal fights would show much more morbid efleminacy than any shrinking from them would do they are no necessary part of mr morrisons strenuous and courageous purpose but we must not part from the book with a censure for dicky the hero must be given his due in the midst of the sordid cruel desperate jago he grows up unashamed of it accepting its conditions ambitious of its honours a plant of the hideous soil yet a sturdy not unwholesome plant he has affection loyalty and endless courage mr morrison killed him not for the sake of his pathetic deathscene we are sure but because he loved him and his heart  1 a child of the jago by arthur morrison 6s methuen revolted against the thought of the lads ingenuity hardening into ugly craft his brave philosophy into callousness his daring into insolent crime and so he lets the child of the jago die in no odour of sanctity to be sure but round the little outcast from all that is respectable he has woven a halo of charm,dom

heris the most interesting heroine that miss hunt has yet achieved that she is entirely human we cannot say but as the varied and not always pleasing incidents in the career of this waif of society are unrolled before us we recognise that she possesses the qualities of honesty and courage in an unusual degree and that they help to set her above the stale and squalid atmosphere of the divorce court with which her surroundings are tainted amy is at no time an adventuress in the ordinary sense of the word the necessity for a friendless girl to earn her bread in whatever way presents itself and the genuine passion for making herself useful which is her dominant characteristic combine to place her in those ambiguous positions which miss hunt appears to consider necessary for her heroines amys story really begins when for the second time she enters jeremy dands family as companion a post from which she had been previously ejected for interfering with a man in a parisian hotel who attempted to shoot himself now there is a second mrs dand and this pale clever girl speedily makes herself indispensable to every member of a peculiarly artificial household and not least to its splendid but rather uncouth master the ultimate catastrophe is approached with all the skill and originality of which miss hunt is mistress and when it arrives it is remorselessly complete the story is undoubtedly clever chiefly because while there is much in it that jars and no single character that is essentially attractive miss hunt succeeds in compelling our respect and sympathy for the white

clever novel which is sure to attract a large measure of the reading publics attention also one may reasonably expect that the story will excite comment and provoke discussion the cleverness of the book is indeed so manifest that it may inspire a regret in the minds of some readers that miss hunt had not informed her subject with a finer or sterner quality there is a marked energy shown in the writing considerable ingenuity and in places almost subtlety in the characterisation  but somehow the author fails to quicken our sympathies or to stir our emotions amy steevens the heroine of the story illustrates this deficiency in the authors powers more than all the other characters put together amy is miss hunts masterpiece in many details she is sketched with a quite brilliant fidelity to nature she is a volatile character as quickwitted as a cockney streeturchin courageous in her many struggles with life shrewd peculiarly adroit in her management of persons whose intelligence have not been stung out of lethargy by poverty and want ready in speech and action and generally filled with the commonest common sensebefore she fell in love with mr dand nevertheless with all her many attributes of individuality and fascination amy remains even to the last chapter nothing more than a splendidly interesting companion we are always interested in her but we never feel for her she amuses us with her stratagems fascinates us with her adventures and finally draws from us a tacit acknowledgment that she has been a very unhappy creature whose circumstances in life have been ordered by the spirit of tragedy this ultimate admission is forced from the reader by the bare recital of her story  but it is impossible to shed tears over amy or to feel the tragedy that we know exists as with amy so with every other character in this remarkable book they all interest us by their sayings and doings amuse and tantalise us but fail to touch the pulses of emotion they are a barbarous set of people even to mr dand the middleaged country gentleman and peculiarly vulgar in their habits of thought dand in this latter respect is the greatest offender of all this person marries twice and to both wives amy steevens at different periods in her career acts as a paid companion the girl ends by becoming dands mistress and dies in giving birth to his child dand commits suicide as in some early chapter does a certain sir mervyn dymond who is perhaps the only unconvincing character in the novel as will be seen the book has more than its share of violent climaxes but the entire scheme of the story is unfolded with so plausible an appfeafance of truth sustained everywhere by the force and freshness of the writing that the reader does not pause to doubt or even question anything we accept

B3309,['8601661'],  the queens shilling ta quemes aiiny a soldiers story by captain arthur griffiths in two volumes henry s king and co we ae very much mistaken if the two novelists dear above all others to military menlever and thackeraywe not especially dear to captain griffiths we should say that at some distinct period of his life he has been under the sway of each of these magicians and that their potent wands still exercise a joint spell over him at all events in  the queens shilling  he has produced something that serves to remind us of both these old masters if their mantles have not in some fragmentary shape fallen upon him he has at least contrived to echo their tones in an uncommonly genuine fashion at the same time no one must expect to find in captain griffiths a second lever or thackeray the inspiration or imitation whichever it be is not a replica in any sense of the word in no respect is the story copied from any other and there is in it individuality enough to give its author a distinct place among novelists which if it does not bring him anywhere near the first class as certainly raises him head and shoulders above the herd the novel is called  a soldiers story   and inasmuch as the narrative portions are written with a good deal of humour and life and are seldom even for half a page wanting in interest it reminds us of charles lever and inasmuch as one or two of the characters the hero and dr starkie among the number are such as thackeray might have sketched out we are reminded involuntarily of that inimitable pen that knowing all classes and grades knew perhaps soldiers best coming however as we do in the eighth chapter suddenly and most unexpectedly on the mystery captain griffiths has thought good to trail before us we experience a feeling of revulsion at the unwelcome apparition and earnestly regret that anything of the sort is allowed to interfere with a really good story the plot becomes very soon transparent as the noonday and so entirely commonplace that we believe the interest of the tale would be actually heightened by its removal whilst all that was worth saving would remain hiding in a curtained balcony the hero at the early age of sixteen overhears a passage of arms between lady moynehan and a footman in which the lady comes off second best the menial being as usual in possession of a secret the secret pertains to lady moynehans niece with whom it is clearly the heros intention to fall in love it is produced with a flourish on several favourable opportunities and always procures the desired effect in the end the secret turns out to be not so bad as it might be the wicked get more or less trampled upon and the proper people marry each other but looking at  the queens shilling as we prefer to do apart from its plot it is easy to find in it not a few really admirable pointy the author has now and then indulged a weakness for smart things to a damaging extent and he bas certainly overweighted his vessel with personal lumber in the shape of one or two characters who appear about twice and then disappear for ever though we are constantly expecting them to turn up again he might with advantage have avoided both these faults and perhaps will do so on a future occasion in the following incident for instance captain griffithss straining after conversational smartness has produced a very miserable result hero and heroine are playing croquet together   what a nice game this i89s he said with enthusiasm heroine however snubs him  it is a horribly stupid game i think i wonder why people are so mad about it time was when at such a reply alured would have shut up like a limpet but he was a man now hero then proceeds to vindicate his manhood in the following refined manner  he put up his hand quickly to his nose and felt for his handkerchief whatever is the matter mr frere inquired millicent quite hurriedly i was only feeling if my nose was off  off   yes bitten off by me f how absurd you are she cried bursting into a merry laugh the scenery of the story is all very graphically presented there is a freshness about the life at the rgmental dep6t in the crimea at aldershot and in new zealand that convinces us of its reality this leads us to i conclude that captain griffiths was warranted in giving his hero a commission at the early age of sixteen and in making him adjutant of his regiment at twentythree during the crimean war boyensigns were gazetted week by week but not many we should suppose only sixteen years and a few months old there is moreover no reason for thus transgressing what appear to us to be the bounds of probability unless captain griffiths thinks it absolutely indispensable to send his hero out as a newspaper correspondent to the francogerman war and is of opinion that no one ought to marry when he is more than thirtysix he would have lone well to have sacrificed either his francogerman war or his theory of marriage we conclude this notice

posthumous works which her sorrowing friends have published which she with the modesty of genius supposed to be unfit for the public eye because they did not come up to her own ideal standard of excellence but the welcome that has been given to all of them and their undoubted merit shows us what she would have been had it been the will of providence that her genius should ripen to maturity god however thought otherwise and took her pure and holy spirit to himself the daysof bruce is another of her fictions a composition of her early youth but full of beauty her purpose in this story is to depict and develop the character of woman in vamious situations of trial in isabella of buchan we have a picture of a heart wounded in its affections but trustful and hopeful in its misery in

beset her path of life guacie aguilan knew the female heart better than any writer of our day and in every fiction from her pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of the motives and

B8082,['6769224'],  twentyfive years reminiscences stories and memories by katharine tynan smith elder and co ios 6d net it is required in writers of reminiscences that they possess one of two qualifications either they must have worthy matter to set down or they must have a worthy manner of retailing happenings of small moment in the larger world of affairs with our new psychological scale of values there has come about a new perspective in the relative importance of events thus things that to a former generation seemed of mighty concern now bulk much less largely in our estimation while a detail that one of the older historians would have passed over entirely is now magnified and given its true significance and force so it frequently happens that for sheer enjoyment and for actual edification using that term in its widest sense a book full of memories of the most trivial kind will outshine weightier works both on account of the charm of its style and because of its wealth of significance when both matter and manner are of the highest order the result is likely to become a classic miss katharine tynan for she is not yet mrs hinkson in this volume has brought out of the treasures of memory things both great and small holding the balance pretty evenly between the trivial and the weighty and exhibiting all with much happiness of manner the whole work reminds one of a delightful oldfashioned garden in which one can wander at will and pluck many fragrant and beautiful blooms we turn to the greater names first and find a goodly list sir charles russell gladstone parnell cardinal manning the morrises the rossettis the meynells william sharp w b yeats and george russell ae miss tynan was introduced to gladstone at the house of sir charles russell but the encounter that made the most impression on that occasion was her meeting with parnell towards whom her attitude is throughout worshipful indeed whether one loves or hates that tragic yet fascinating figure one cannot but admire the wholehearted devotion of miss tynan to him and to his cause there is much concerning parnell and much of the writers association with the land league which will interest students of that particular history a very distinct and rather amusing picture of christina rossetti emerges on page 158 she entered the room wearing short serviceable skirts of an irongrey tweed and stout boots her dress did not at all go with her spiritual face and the heavilylidded wideapart eyes which one only finds in a highlygifted woman  i certainly believe she made the worst of herself perhaps as a species of mortification she even affected a short matteroffact way of speaking which took me somewhat aback at our first meeting she put one off sitting at her feet completely concerning william sharp the author says decisively  i may say here that i do not even yet believe that william sharp was fiona macleod but of that more in its proper place on that point we looked anxiously for further enlightenment but found none so we presume we must wait for one of the two further volumes of memories which miss tynan hopes to publish the few glimpses of wilde are not very flattering he seems never to have sparkled in her presence there is a great deal about w b yeats the earlier reminiscences partake very much of the nature of loving banter we imagine that the future biographer of the irish poet may some day be very grateful to miss tynan for her pages on his early development very interesting and curious it is to read of his entire absorption in poetry during youthhe lived breathed ate drank and slept poetry in another place she says i remember how the big dublin policemen used to eye him in those days as though uncertain whether to run him in or not but by and by they used to say shure tisnt mad he is nor yet drink taken tis the poethry thats disturbin his head and leave him alone in his inability to take care of himself and his utter forgetfulness of all but poetry he fulfils the traditional figure of a poet in his youth pretty completely further later reminiscences and a number of letters round off this part of miss tynans book equally interesting is the romantic personality of george russell to whose poetry the english public seems just awakening there is something almost olympian about his figure he tells what is perhaps one of the best stories in the volume he told me a story the other day of a friend of his who somewhere in the wilds of america became friends with an old indian he told him all the marvels of the old worldwireless telegraphy radium men flying in air speech kept long after the speaker is dead wonderful wonderful said the indian tell me more at last the reciter paused wearied the white man is very wonderful said the indian can he do this he stooped lifted a handful of dust and threw it in the air stretched himself upwards and thin delicate flames ascended from his hands and his feet and his hair his body shone in air he was a living jewel from head to foot then the glory faded there was only an old indian can the white man do that he asked it is required also of writers of reminiscences that they should display a certain degree of intimacy and should refrain as far as possible from the use of limelight here again miss tynan satisfies our requirements one does feel closing her book that one has really got to know her the person who emerges with perhaps greatest distinctness from her pages is her own father his strong points and weaknesses are alike set down with a loving pen he is very lovable very human with more than a touch of greatness we are grateful too for the accounts of one or two early friends who died untimely some of them showing considerable promise rose kavanagh frances wynne charles g fagan and jim alderson they are written of with an affection that it is good to see in these reticent days of lesser points we might mention a score if space allowed such as miss tynans theory that hair is an index to character or the naive confession of her early earnings and how she spent them in a way that would shock the unco guid or this single characteristic flash of memory of g b s who in a lecture on brownings caliban upon setebos remarked that if caliban was now alive he would belong to the philharmonic society  we can promise many hours of pleasure to

B8560,['8794453'],  stories after nature by charles wells with a preface by w j linton lawrence  bullen charles wells wras one of a singular little group of men who made distinguished failures at the beginning of this century there was thomas lovell beddoes whose memory has been recently revived  there was somewhat later in date ebenezer jones whose remarkable poetic work is of a kind that does not easily permit justice to be done to it there was li il horne who unlike the others of the company wrote too much rather than too little  there were smaller men like george darley who for a short time attracted more attention than they deserved and then fell into a neglect not altogether merited there was finally charles wells the author of  stories after nature a book of prose and joseph and his brethren a drama in verse wells was born in london in 1800 he died at marseilles in 1879 he was a friend of keats who addressed to him a sonnet of thanks for a gift of roses it was in rivalry with keats according to though legend that he wrote at the age of twentyfour the biblical drama of  joseph and his brethren two years earlier he had published anonymously a little book  stories after nature now for the first time reprinted from the excessively rare original stories and play passed without notice and wells abandoned literatureat all events published nothing more and after living first in wales then at quimper in brittany he settled at marseilles where he died at the age of seventynine it was only by the hazard of though secondhand bookstall that wellss two volumes were eventually recoveredthe stories by mr w j linton who has written a rambling preface for the present reprint the play by rossetti who showed it to mr swinburne mr meredith and others of his friends all of whom tried in vain to find a publisher for so forgotten a poet in 1876 joseph and his brethren was reprinted with an enthusiastic introduction by mr swinburne not till last year was a publisher found for the  stories after nature and mr bullen who has learnedly edited many reprints in his time has wisely limited the edition to four hundred for the  stories after nature full of delicate grace of romantic charm as they are cannot be compared as literature with joseph and his brethren that drama is not a good drama but it is a really great dramatic poem mr swinburne went so far as to draw a comparison between the character of shakespeares cleopatra and the character of potiphars wife in wellss play it is not however so much in characterization as in language that wells may be said to attain to something of shakspearean strength and savour but it is with the verse of shakespeare in his earlier period that we must compare the slow marchmovement of the verse in joseph and his brethren the prose style of the  stories after nature is in its own fashion similarly archaic but with the archaism of a particular period that was not to our present way of thinking over happy in its return to the antique every period has its idea its ideal of the archaic today it is mr william morris who sets us the pattern and undoubtedly it is a pattern woven with learned skill and a nice sense of the art of speech the archaism affected by wells was somewhat after the fashion of leigh hunt and might be described as an attempt to combine the style of the  decameron with the style of the most metaphorical among the elizabethans the mixture is somewhat singular sometimes effective not always acceptable the touches of elizabethan colour are at times mere violent incongruities they are at times curiously impressive bright grandeur disarrayed is a phrase that might have done honour to  joseph and his brethren and it is of a passage in that play the lines beginning  for household murder is a household rat that wc are reminded in reading  aye but household murders are dangerous things  they tell tales  they speak out after long being dumb  fifty years is not the date of their bond they haunt thc place and then men dream of it wells chose from  hamlet as the motto for his book the line which declares that to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand the choice was a happy one for the tales with all their rouge and frippery of form breathe a singularly clear and upright morality and are rich in examples of noble manhood and gracious womanhood it is in this sense that they may be said to be done  after nature for they have certainly little enough of the semblance of ordinary reality generally healthy in idea they have at the same time something morbid in their refining upon sentiment their insistence upon the qualities of delicacy linc feeling and the like their feminine or not quite manly fopperies of phrase a playground of delicate fancies a perfumed growth of hothouse flowers these stories recall in another art though pictures of simeon solomon exquisite exotic unreal with a certain immaturity in design a certain weakness in execution but with the morbid loveliness of the artificial it is not likely that the book will ever take a place in english literature certainly not such a place as that occupied by  joseph and his brethren but it will be remembered let us hope with other curiosities  it will bo opened from time to time by those who are critical enough not to be too critical of the immature and for these there will always be a certain charm in the quaintlynamed narratives of christian and his companions or patriotism and liberty of edmund and edward or the two friendsto name but two out of many  but it was enough for him to hear even the music of freedom and liberty at a distance as it were singing in the wind how finely that is said and it could be said too of the writer and to take another and last quotation there is something of distinction something of fine effect in so representative a passage as this   when gustavus had recovered his voice he said firmly and in a manly tone  ye neither of you know me that i am so mean in the opinions of my honourable companions is much very much  but that i am iso mean in my own is more i am mad to think of what i have lost i am glad that i am overtaken in my crime be it known to you lord frederick that in some senses you are the poorest of the two  for you are proud to wrench from humanity that which i loathe and shall throw by i know not why but i feel you are out of my memory i regret not to leave you and hardly seem to have done you an offence but to the greater and gentle christian what can i say  never enoughnever half i feel

mr thurston will refrain from tearing neurosis to tatters that he will abjure the popian herehat life is all a single  ruling passion and that he will ut aside all thoughts of the curtain the footlight and the 1 idden orchetra  fiction the apple of eden by e temple thurston chapman  hall os this is the story of a great temptation of a mans struggle with it and of his ultimate victory  the man is an irish catholic priest and his struggle is to keep the vow of celibacy he made without understanding what it means he has grown to adolescence first in a remote farmhouse and then in a seminary and when he is a man in years he knows as little of the world as a child the book opera with a scene in the village confessional the priest hears a young mans story of seduction and he counsels the penitent either to marry the girl or never to see her again it is on father michaels agitation as the young man speaks of the girls beauty that the readers attention is fixed for the priest is a student waking suddenly in fear and trembling to the facts of life mr thurston writes of these facts with a plainness that will give offence to some to those who think a novel should not deal with questions of sex because it necessarily reaches minds unfit for such discussions and also to those catholics who will shrink from the picture of a priest disloyal to his vows yet the apple of eden leaves a stronger impression of spiritual charm than of physical coarseness and the author succeedsas the author of that great novel  ekkehardt succeededin invoking your sympathy with the priest both in his struggle with temptation and in his horrorstricken repentance if you are a protestant you may read a novel that makes a great todo about a monk and feel at the end of it that any woman might have married him as cheerfully as if he had been a solicitor but then the author has failed in the main purpose of his story which was to rouse in all his readers some understanding of the tremendous issues involved for the man concerned some sympathy with the commotion raised in his soul some belief beyond all differences of creed in the binding force on mankind of solemn vows mr thurston has not failed and this is due partly to his fine portrait of the erring priest but also to his companion portrait of father connelly the curates superior and friend and the most delightful character in the story his breezy kindly commonsense appreciates the younger mans subtler nature forgives him his sins and helps him to save himself at the end the two priests are the book the other characters are subsidiary for a long time even roona the girl with whom father michael falls so passionately in love only comes in like a shadow why did mr thurston blot her past with an unconvincing story of seduction she is the girl of whom the young man spoke in the first chapter after a long delay she becomes his unwilling wife and soon after her marriage she is ready to leave her husband for a priest of her church it is father michael who ordains that he and she shall part but in the scenes where she meets and learns to love him she never for a moment behaves like a girl with a questionable history and we do not believe that she had one we should like to know who took her to the theatre and walked with her in regent street if it was her future husband it is odd that father michael who recognises his former penitent in a later chapter did not recognise him then the pictures of irish country life are drawn with knowledge and are interesting but the triumph of the book is father connelly  the apple cf eden by e temple thurston il  chapman  hall the novel with a purpose always stands in danger of being wrecked by its purpose it is very difficult to subordinate the moral design to the canons of art and this is particularly difficult when the writer is a beginner without a proper knowledge of the rules and limitations of his art yet on the whole mr thurstons book comes out of the ordeal fairly well his novel is a diatribe against celibacy in the priesthood and he has selected a theme which gives his case the utmost strength it could have in other words he tests his conclusions by extremes it is obvious that all roman catholic priests are not in the position in which the rev father everett found himself but it is equally obvious that the case may have occurred mr thurstons opinion seems to be that a young man of the age at which priests are ordained is not in a position to judge of his ability to renounce certain passions but he probably makes the mistake of letting father everett develop his error too quickly the priest only escapes finally because to him  the sacrament of matrimony was ordained by god the vow of celibacy was ordained by man it seems then that had not the sacrament stood in the way he would have fallen from his vows and that appears to be what mr thurston would justify such questions are naturally not for consideration here  but we may say that in working out his problem the author reveals large powers of intuition and realization he is also skilful in his delineation of a woman and in rendering irish life when he drops his problems he will probably write a very good novel,dom

the lighter and more pleasing phases of life and character we are led to these reflections by the impression which  martin pole has made upon us the book consists of a series of tales supposed to be related by an old gardener named matthew micklethrift three of these tales were written by miss saunders and one of them named  old miatthews puzzle she wrote at the age of sixteen the other tales are the productions of mr saunders her father who wrote them many years ago the construction of the story is this the old gardener introduces us to martin poles mother who has married a second husband a squire pole a man of sixtyfive after having one child by her first marriage james hilman matthew describes mrs pole as a proud unbending woman with a sweeping walk with blue eyes with piles of flaxen curls and with a habit of staring straight at people without seeming to see them she had never spoken to matthew until he had lived there five years when he rescued her from the importunities of a troublesome gypsy woman after this a child was born who is martin pole halfbrother to james hilman martin is pale and sickly and to most people seems not engaging but old matthew likes him the best of the two there is a fatal shadow over his home there is something wrong with his mother for when mistress pole sits at work with martin beside her she often clenches her hands and her lips turn white she has screaming fits too and seems altogether a very unfit companion for poor little weakly martin who is morbidly fascinated by her strange behaviour at sixteen martin who has been sent to school comes home ill the squire is dead and the mother and son live together for some time no wonder that he continues ailing even four years of college life do not shake off the effects of his gloomy life at home then comes the miothers deathbed scene and a secret connected with her history but for this as it is a secret our readers may be referred to the book the different stories which follow are told to martin for a purpose connected with that secret we will only intimate that the great object to be obtained is to draw martins mind away from a particular train of though at a particular time the first tale is read out to martin by james hilman it is called  the plague stone of aberford we could almost fancy that the sun insurance office officials must have been reading this tale over night and in a dream resulting from it mistaken mr wolley for mr chorley the father of constance there were however in mr chorleys house large rolls of paper dry peasticks firewood and candles all placed in most suspicious array and the house mysteriously took fire in a manner not easily accounted for and there is moreover no comparison between the poor little place in which constance and her father lived and the campden house mansion filled with all the wonders of art collected by mr wolley and in the case of constances father unlike that of mr trolley there was everything to gain by an act of incendiarism mr chorley however though guilty plays his part so craftily that he is d thanked in the name of the office for his courageous admirable conduct as he turns away when thanked to hide his feelings he meets the glance of his little daughter constance  mournful and stern as e eye of an accusing angel soon after this constance who is but a child in martin pole by john saundes author of 6 abel drakes wife c in twr volume tinsley brothers ears sets forth into the world with her little brother whom she had rescued froin the fire she refuses to live with her father or to let her brother remain with hinm wel shall not follow her in her wanderings there are several passages of great tenderness and touiching beauty especially in her story with kits friends and in the lovepassages between kit and constance but our judgement revolts against the impossible union of a childs weaknless with the strength of a womans nature it needs all the touches of affection and happiness between kit and his grandfhther and eppie to relieve the dreariness of that part of the story which relates to marimadukes mniserable falling away and his dieath after all constances sacritices to save him we must however remember that this is a story which james hilman whose interest it is lot to cheer martin chooses to read to him as it is old matthews turn next we might expect a cheerful story to succeed for he knows the importance of bringrilna cheerfulness to the patients aid we are therefore surprised and disappointed to find that wvhen told to begin old matthew says begin  lord bless me sir if it doesnt set ones flesh creeping to go hunting up the dead out of the churchyard yonder then follows  old matthews puzzle in which we have a shipwreck in the fifth palge  and the lamentable experience of one of the women named i martha prew who getting more thin and white and scaredlooking every day still lives on and on in spite of a pack of sorrows she has at son whose bringint up troubles her greatly and about whom there is evidently a secret very unpleasant people in everyday life are those people with secrets this however is the first piece of the  puzle the next two are a workshop and a pretty young woman a niece of marthas old matthew says that although she was reckoned pretty  she was too much like a cat for hit we should conceive of her as more like a serpent she is at any rate by no means an agreeable i object of contemplation her low straight forehead was so white iou could see the blue veins but when she was upset those veins would work to a dark purple we shall not follow this story suffice it to say that its interest is entirely of the  sensational character the winding up of it is so horrible that we can but hope that miss saunders will henceforth turn her imaginative powers to a more agreeable use the  curates story is the most cheerful in the book there is neither murder arson nor suicide in it only a very pleasant frank kindly girl a father worthy of such a daughter and a curate who must be everything that is desirable for margaret loves himi devotedly  jerry and his haunted crust which is by miss saunders is decidedly more pleasing than  the puzzle we do not however quite like the prayers in ungrammatical language of course we know that illiterate folk must even pray as well as talk in bad grammar but it would be better to leave that to be understood we have yet  good deal of sensational work to go through in the windinrgup chapter but it is a comfort to know that after all these dismal stories the listening patient is cured a time comles when he walks abroad and  the stones echo under martin poles firm tread we can scarcely fancy indeed that he could have been so very quickly restored to strength it should have taken much time and much quinine to brine him round after all that he had had to go through on the whole we do not think this book is likely to add to mir saunderss reputation as for his own share in its contents he might have done more wisely in not giving his juvenile writings to the public in an artists studio there hangs many an unfinished or selfcondemned sketch over whiclh mlanyprecious hours have been spent  not wasted but spent with a profitable resultin greater skill and clearer insight for the working out of the pictures from which the artists fame may at lest accrue but when once he has obtained a respectable degree of success he may well refrain from setting before the public gaze all the sketches and rough drafts which have preceded there is enough talent however in parts of the plague of aberford wand ill the  curates story to make us look forward to another 1and a better work from mir saunders  which he had promised us ill his last edition of abel drakes wvife but which is not  martin pole,dom
B2426,"['8653449', '8479105']",  the cloister and the hearth a tale of the middle ages new novels by charles reade 4 vols trubner  co whatever mr read writes is sure to have some good substance in it plenty of weft as weavers say mr read never grudges his labour indeed he seems to love it for its own sake in this present work he gives his readers plenty for their moneyand those who like to have a book which they may read in peace without any prospect of coming too speedily to the end and without any possible prevision of what the end will turn out to be may here find a story to their mind  the cloister and the hearth is full to overflowing of adventures of the most marvellous and heartthrilling description dangers so imminent and escapes so hairbreadth that the reader will feel almost as nervous as if they had ended fatally the time is in the middle of the fifteenth century the scene is laid in many places for there is a great deal of travelling both by land and waterbut holland and italy are the places where the people most concerned in the story transact the chief part of their affairs the description of the little town of tergou in holland where elias and catherine the father and mother of the hero gerard reside and the account of their domestic life are like an old flemish interior brought intoaction catherinethe kindhearted honest prejudiced thrifty housewife with her harsh rind and tender core is charming and lifelikeelias with his sternness silence and love of justice is equally goodboth axe true to their own nature and look like a pair of portraits by cranach mr read has caught the spirit and colour of the age he has selected in all the conversations actions manners and customs the reader is taken back to the everyday life of that age it was the very eve of the reformation the printingpress had just become an accomplished fact and was beginning to send abroad its first winged sheets luther was not born but the time was fast ripening for his appearance it is a period full of interest to us we are familiar with it and in mr reades pages it wears the kindly aspect of an oldremembered time instead of toeing a stiff imitation of a bygone state of things the characters are all warm the descriptions are vivid the tone of thought and the turn of speech are consistent and probable the first volume is the best there is more actionthe story moves briskly and the foundation of it is well laid giving no indication of its future course the loves of gerard and margarettheir dangerthe fatality that hinders their legal marriage when on the very steps of the altar their cruel separationthe escape of gerard are all told well and rapidly the description of the german inn where gerard takes refuge on though first night of his wandering has the air of being an interior drawn from the life but the details are far more coarse than was necessary and are enough to disgust fastidious readers there was not the least need to prbeuer all the horrors of the dirt and close confinement of an overcrowded lodging there nie touches of human kindness and good feeling put in which redeem them but mrreade might have done this and yet left the other undone with advantage as the story proceeds it begins to drag heavily mr read is more anxious to show forth his own reading and research in the records of the life and times of the age than to attend to the business of the story indeed his characters for awhile become mere pegs on which to hang the incidents he has gathered from books and the pedantry spoils the interest the knowledge he has obtained is not sufficiently assimilated  it is given too much as he found it as though he had copied whole pages of an itinerary throughout the whole of the second volume the story stagnates the style itself being quaint and deliberate aids this effect from time to time the reader comes upon a flash of melodramatic adventure that quickens his interest and these portions are effective and well told but though the danger incurred may be great though reader as he proceeds feels sure that though escape is proportionately certain there is an attack by robbers in an inn which is really exciting but when all is over the reader pauses to observe that the bottle of phosphorus with which gerard smeared the face of the dead robber and so scared back the surviving ruffians is farfetched and as improbable as that a traveller in these days should if attacked by robbers find himself provided with a complete photographing apparatus to take their likenesses and so aid the police detective in his search after justice gerards letter to margaret is good but far too long it is however an excellent panorama of travel as performed in those days the burning of the mill and destruction of the banditti is a fine piece of surrey or victoria theatre melodrama the scenes where margaret enters are the quietest and best in the work her reconciliation with the parents of gerard has some true and touching traits the plot of though two brothers of gerard is well indicated and it is all the more effective for being intimated and not detailed there are some good scenes in gerards life in rome but all are too long and want coherence there is a drawl both in thc style and in the story we object to though effect produced on gerard by the false tidings of margarets deathit is arbitrary and not in accordance with any previous indication it is patched on not developed from the character the effect on the reader is painful and does not impress him as true in any way the recognition of margaret is a strongly marked situation but it is too violent and the subsequent portion of the story drags painfully the readers sympathy is thoroughly excited for both margaret and gerard from the force of circumstances  but mr read protracts this portion without judgement or mercy the death of margaret is very touching and the intimation given quite at the end that this story is the history of the j a parents of the great erasmus gives the reader  f a sense of belief and reality in all that has j fc gone before which is highly satisfactory in t summing up our judgement on this work we j r must say that it has many merits but that j t there is a coarseness of workmanship which i 1 takes away both from the value of the story c and though pleasure of the reader the work j i contains materials enough for halfadozen j  ordinary novels but they need a thorough j i supervision and compression to make the book i as good as with the labour and research i bestowed to gather those materials together i 1 it ought to be we have not mentioned the j  character of denys the french soldier he is i amusing and assists the story in important  difficultieshe however fades out of sight as  s though the author had forgotten him or found j 1 him troublesome and his reappearance is con1  trary to any doctrine of chances readers will accept the novel and read it with omissions according to

these volumes gives all its human interest and pathos writing english for latin thus runs the history on which the novel of the cloister and the horth is foundedwe give it in place of a summary of mr charles reades plot he erasmus was born at rotterdam on the eve of st simon and st jude his mother was named margaret the daughter of a certain peter a physician she was from zevenberge he saw her two brothers men nearly ninety years old at dord recht his father was named gerard he had secret union with the said margaret with hope of marriage and some said that there was a lawful betrothal that matter was considered a disgrace by the parents and brothers of gerard his father was eli his mother catherine each lived to extreme old age catherine almost to her ninetyfifth year there were ten brothers no sister of the same parents all married gerard was born youngest but one it seemed fit to all that of so great a number one should be consecrated to god you know the feelings of the old and the brothers wished that the property should not be diminished but that there should be a house for them to live together in gerard seeing himself in every wayshut out of marriage by the full agreement of all did as the desperate do fled secretly and sent from his journey a letter to his parents and brothers showing a hand locked in a hand with the sentence added farewell i shall never see you meanwhile the wife he had desired was left with child the boy was nursed at his grandmothers gerard betook himself to rome there by writing for the printers art then was not he supported himself but he was most skilful in handwriting and he lived gaily presently he applied his mind to honest study in greek and latin he made handsome progress and in knowledge of the law he reached to no common proficiency for rome was then wonderfully rich in learned men he heard guarini he copied with his own hand all authors when his parents learned that he was in rome they wrote to him that the girl whom he had desired to marry was dead he crediting that through grief was made a priest and applied his whole mind to religion returned home he discovered the fraud yet neither did she ever afterwards marry another man neither did he ever approach her as a husband but he took liberal care for the education of the boyof this care the brief chronicle follows  at nine years old he sent him to deventer his mother followed him custodian and guardian of his tender years the progress of the child the teaching of johann sintheim zinthius c are mentioned  here he reached to the third class then the plague vehemently raging carried off the mother the son being left in his thirteenth year when  the plague daily raging more and more desolated the  whole household to which he belonged he returned to  his own country gerard receiving the sad tidings fell  sick and soon afterwards died each died when but a  little beyond the age of forty with the touch of a true genius mr read gives form and substance to these notes every curt memorandum is used as the key to unlock mysteries and sorrows of a bygone tale of love and suffering in spite of the text to the contrary mr read gives a sickly little daughter to be a good angel beside the hearth of eli and catherine of course also he holds firmly by a certainty instead of a mere possibility that the child of gerard and margaret was born of a sacred union a betrothal before witnesses held then to be as binding as a marriage the avarice of gerards brothers by which he was thrown on his own resources mr reade for artistic purpose centres upon two and he relieves the parents of the shame of the lying letter sent to rome by giving to those two brothers and a hostile burgomaster the discredit of it but there is such good artistic reason for every small variation from the line marked out by the compendium that in some sense the changes are no doubt recoveries of truth on gerards  wandeyjihre his fifteenth century pilgrimage as a penniless copyist of manuscript from holland to italy much labour is spent the letter home with the picture of clasped hands over the farewell is emphasised in the novel by a woodcut reproducing such a picture everything is in fact honestly turned to account side lights that were to be got from other old narratives and from the touches of life and character scattered about the works of erasmus

exquisite pathos in the sacred innocence of the communion between gerard and margaret they are husband and wife only in love to their son but during the last twelve years of their lives sublime their own passions into a pure eternal friendship not again passionate with human yearnings until margaret is smitten with the plague and gerard has but to die and join her in the grave we must illustrate the spirit of the story with an extract gerard having heard suddenly on his return to his own district as a preaching dominican that margaret lives and by what fraud the barrier was set between him and her has thundered in passion the curse of the church against his two evil brothers and withdrawn to a vacant hermits cell meanwhile there has been obtained for him the parsonage of gouda but he is

B7478,['8929531'],  new novelsl the drum8 of war by henry de vere stacpoole john murray we must regard mr stacpoole at this stage as in the forefront of romantic writers it is not certain that in sheer romance he does not beat his rivals his power over an atmosphere is as remarkable as his facility he wanders from epoch to epoch and from country to country his new novel is concerned with the france of the third empire we have an incidental glimpse very vivid of the disastrous policy which culminated in the fatuous and frenzied cries of a berlin but for the most part the story is divorced from history it has at its base a tradition that the persons of an ancient tragedy are reproduced in hero and heroine and fulfil their allotted fate  heroine  is perhaps the wrong word to use as it is probable that the author as well as his readers would claim as heroine another woman than margaret von lichtenberg candidly the career of this other does not convince us altogether she is too sentimentalized it was unnecessary for mr stacpoole to drag her through the mire why did he  this wantonness is the only blot on an enthralling romance,dom

consideration applauding much and approving of the whole though it treats of modern manners and ol the frivolous actors on a frivolous though lofty stage there is something very poetical grand and even awful in the construction of this tale in its commencement it is blithe with creations light gay and happy  the least is crowned with mirth wit sparkles and there is a sort of graceful revelry among perfumes and howers hut very early we see the serpent creeping from place to place withering everything by its trail a blight falls on these bowers of joy a wanness steals over the countenances of all and at last the drama closes in an atmosphere darkened by horrors and on a scene defiled by blood such is a general outline ol the  victims of society it is not only pathetic but eminently tragic though moral is biaoneil forth with a fearful vivid nesslike the hash of lightning felt through the closed the wilfully closed eyelids it tells distinctly to even the deafened ear of the sensuahst that indiscretion almost always leads to vice vice to crime crime most certainly to a neverfailing misery  and that each is the more difficult to retrace as it approaches the dread climax of woe that must terininate cither in despair or death hut to enter more into particulars we must tell the reader that the  victims of society are rather the vic tims of some of the errors that seem to be inseparable from it highly civilised society maybe compared to a rich soil and which if it were not rich could not produce so many goodly flowers and fruits  but this very richness will and must foster into a most rampant luxuriance all poisonbearing weeds to repress if they cannot wholly eradicate the latter is the office of the divine the legislator and the moralist society itself is not to

is as romantic as possible the sober incidents of domestic life as it is however skilfully preisented are tame anl flat compared with the stirring tales told by every newspaper the novelist enters on the race of competition with narrators who tell of things more strange anid wild than imagination has invented miss willianis has therefore done wisely to plunge at once into the fanciful and the unreal to revel in romance and to invite her readers by incidents that will keep them awake even though fresh ifrom the perusal of the last own correspondents letter in the tunes the plot of the secret marriniqe is not one of those mere pegs for dialogue and description so often seen by the lisappointed reader of which after perusal of the first chapter the end might be predicted by any person familiar with modern fiction but it is an ingeniouslyconstructed story carefully designed and wost pleasantly told it it is improlable it is not niore so than many of our most famous fletions

part of it upon the perusal of the secret marriage we have cornplained on previous occasions o0 the author of  mary powell for that instead of trusting to her own genius she should have condescended to mere mimicry being capable of better things the endeavour to write a book in imitation of writings of an age long past is not new nor has it proved successful in other instances but in the present case there was no need for disguise tle authoress was perfectly competent to sustain a fiction avowedly her own as she has since provedl by tales in which she has thrown aside her self imposed fetters and revelled in her own freedom this is remarkably shown in errs larinda sinyuleheart in which turning aside from the path sihe has hitherto followed so pertinaciously she tells a story of home life in plain english and without any affectation of an extinct orthography or past forms of expression her new novel is exempt fromn these she tells her simple story sinply with exquisite grace in the style of the writing and a wholesome tone pervading the work it abounds too with the purest sentiments eloquently expressed it is but a single volume and we recommend it to all who have leisure it is an excellent family novel for even children may read it with profit as all will with pleasure the heiress of llanydon is by a very practised pen but one that possesses very unequal power the author who writes a great deal miust write many things badly even the good homer sometimes nods  says the latin poet and novelists are not exempt from this human weakness mrs marsh has written some of the best novels our time has seen lbnt it must he admitted also that some of her fictions are not worthy of her fame it may be that sie writes too much the imagination is not inexhaustible as authors are too apt to suppose if continually worked it is liable to reproduce its own images and conceptions rest is necessary to the full exercise of i that faculty its creative powers flag if too often invoked as may be seen in the works of every writer of fiction who counts his novels bv two figures it is manifest in scott cooper james dickens and a multitude of lesser men it is visible in mirs marsh who hias brought forth a new novel almost every year not steadily iniproving by practice as might have been anticipated but beginning with her best work the i two old mlens tales then after an interval flhing upon us again with emilia wlyndham  then flagging for awhile  then proving her capacity by the prerisions of lady elyn and then falling back once more into comparative dullness we cannot say of the i1eiress of himywlaon that it is one of her best but certainly it is not one of her worst it is not the production of her happiest mood it was not thrown off in a moment of inspiration but it was not written as a wearisome task against the inclination the impression it has muade upon us is that the authoress wrote it as a matter of business three volumes were required and she set herself to i make three volunies and sihe applied diligently to the work andl put forthi her artistic skill to i make a plot and to tell a story and here it is this process of professional authorship is however a very different thing front that genuine inspiration whiel iproduces great works in such cases the author does not write because there is some external requirement but by the force of an internal impulse trhe imagination flashes upon him without his will thoughts come thronging words rush to his lips he must give them vent he sets them down to relieve his full mindl and the result is a work of genius amrs marsh has a written this with such an impulse of inspiration but she has also written mechanically and the fiction before us partakes more of the artist than of the creator rlie composition is excellent there is also her wonted beauty of description even more than her usual pathos and much briliant writing but neither in plot nor in character is any creative power shown the former is commonplace  the latter has been introduced to us oftentimes before by herself and by others albert and imogene eugene and laura the two couples who are made happy in the end after the usual variety of crosses are like all other heroes and heroines edward aubrey is the good sensible man of the story but he wants individualitv the only personage distinctly drawn is lady faulconer the bad person of the plot whose scheming it is the business of the three volumes to trace and to defeat sihe is well painted but still she wants originality we have met her before introduced by mirs trollope mrs gore and by mrs alarsh herself we thus freely criticise this latest performance of one of our best living novelists because i we tiink so higily of her capacitics she can do better than this and it is disappointing to find her riot doing her best hasty writing is as bad as hasty marriage it is a mischief to a reputation that cannot readily be undone it ra script1 nmaet too many will be inclined to judge the author more by her failures thani by her successes mrs marsh errs however in common with most of her contemporaries she writes too much and too fast timnc is not given for

calling this decidedly the very best romance that mr james has produced the mystery and the interest are alike well sustained and the principal character delineated with a degree of dramatic power

with the time when the demarcations of society were so broadly drawn and yet oftentimes so suddenly reversed the period too is one of much attraction the low countries have been our european nurseries of commerce and liberty they were the first to break up the foundations of that great feudal system which growing at first out of the necessity for protection which the distracted state of kuroio made necessary in the turbulence of its early darkness became afterwards so intolerably oppressive when peace had its claim as well as war trade brought wealth which was power and brought still morea habit of enterprise men saw the necessity of protection for their gains  hence arose certain rights and privileges wrung first from the weakness of some ruler who looked not beyond the present often revoked and often infringed yet the precedent once established became an authority for war freedom soon took a more extended view and out of those civic immunities and commercial protections grew those ideas of mans unalienable rights now so well understood and so generally insisted upon these volumes present a most animated picture of the period with its tumults and troubles its forests swarming with freebooters its nobles still looking upon themselves as earths savon red ones its burghers growing every day mure conscious of their importance  and the one or two of highertoned minds who inspired by patriotism planned more important schemes for the benefit of their own native lands and towns such are the materials which have been wrought out with animation worthy of those stirring days while the

hope mach step that he took forward seemed but to raise him higher and each effort of an enemy to crush him seemed without any exertion of his own but to clear the way before him such thoughts were mingling with other feelings  brought forth by the sight and the roice and the smile of mary of burgundy when the sudden call to her presence woke him from ouch dreams but woke him only to show to his

indistinct ideas of mighty things danced before his eyes for a moment with a sweeter and brighter image too as the object and end of ambition the reward of mighty endeavour the crowning hoon of infinite success but still he felt and knew even while he dreamed that it was all unreal and as he followed the messenger with a puck pace though vision faded and left him but the cold and naked truth

way to win our favour by merely refusing to let his newest hero sit and wait till his ideal lady comes along to go on a walkingtour to find a wife may sound a trifle too deliberate for romance but then grant a little allegory and it seems all right of his companions of the road we have rather more than a speaking acquaintance with three or four alastor it must be confessed is our favourite and alastor is no golden girl but a charming boy with the star of hope upon his brow and  little wings of haste upon his feet eager for life but life in the empyrean with all the scorn of twenty for the cold wisdom of his elders we should indeed have preferred his company on the quest but we had only the chance of a short meeting then after sundry adventures we fell in with nicolete fishing by the banks of a stream an independent vivacious rather overmature young woman of twenty at least so we guessed from her conversation but the shrewd quester quickly made up his mind that though she was adorable she was a little too young to spend his life with a few days however he does not grudge and in response to her request they set off together and alone on their wanderingfor ever she believes as the sun is shining in the merry month of may we following at a discreet distance prepare to enjoy their adventure enormously but such is their haste or our discretion that we never quite know what happened on the waysunstroke perhapsto reduce the independent and intellectual young woman to sheer inanity when the angry father comes to take her off his hands the hero has our congratulations if not our sympathy then there is sylvia joy whose petticoat and stockings hanging on a clothesline he fell in love with and whose further acquaintance he made when he was benevolently meddling in the affairs of a young married couple who had played away their happiness out of a foolish respect for theory sylvia is quite evidently not the golden girl in his haste he said she would do instead only

being within the range of her eyes he perhaps never took very seriously for though they went through the mystic rite of  pressing each others feet under the table at their first meeting that apparently is not the kind of thing the golden girl is in the habit of doing and meanwhile a face had haunted him a face set round with chestnut hair which he met one day on an  apocalyptic moorland he met it again years afterfor the walkingtour did not end his questin piccadilly and it was set about this time with golden locks the quest is at an end his one discontent is with the altered hue time can undo what art has done but she prophecies the death of their happiness when the chestnut hue returns is there symbolism here perhaps it is our own suggestion not the heros that only whilst an artificial light dwelled about elizabeth could the romance remain mr le gallienne will not kill the romance he lets her die instead his hero is puzzled over the psychology of this woman of his heart so should we be if we accepted his view of the matter why should he not love a lovable outcast why to explain his devotion to an unhappy woman who has fallen low should he insist that in spite of all her history she was a puritan  to read sundayschool stories and to think atheists the most depraved of human beings is not to be a puritan he should have the proud courage of his love or give it up besides the girls of a more or less golden hue this hero found some other entertaining things he discovered the foolishness of theory for instance and pleasantly illustrates the same he promulgates some opinions and theories of his own too which we may find amusing without endorsing for example that gipsies being now along with waterfalls and ruined castles  the public property of the emotions

fooling distasteful for sentiment mr le gallienne is not always fooling but the truth is we are handicapped in our appreciation of his fantasy by the too wide difference between his views of the romantic and our own we knew it when we reached p 48 where occurs the story of the love of the lady of the manor she was once an actress for the village schoolmaster they used to meet in the dingle

gailiennes style the adventures of the hero related in the first person are very loosely strung together with little confidences to the reader and reflections on the lack of progress in the story which smack of  padding at other times the author is fluent to excess his reflections on a single look are 44 similarly in that moment i seemed to have dived into this unknown girls eyes to have

enough wit and fancy to do without these wearisome adjuncts of some modern humour the plain sensuality of many pages the insistence on details modern taste has agreed to leave unmentioned is a much more serious matter sentimental journeys nowadays should surely leave out some of sternes effects there is here not to mince matters much of that odd and most uncomfortable coarseness which we are

his readers to venice in the seventeenth century and to all the paraphernalia of cloaks and swtords masks and daggers which have been the undisputed property of the london journal since the days of monk lewis  there is a melancholy helpless heroism about the action which at once commands our respect and moves our pity how little appreciation of the time in which he lives must an author have to whom the historical novel seems still a fitting vehicle for amusement or instruction we could scarcely have been more surprised at being asked to read a new  grand cyrus or a fresh chronicle of amadis of gaul than at finding an author as yet unknown to fame and we venture to presume young offering to a public that feeds on mudie a story which uses again all the devices and machinations familiar in the days of anne radcliffe or g p r james quite oblivious of the oftenquoted advice of corinna to pindar about sowing with thc hand and not with the whole sack mr trolloxe calmly reproduces in one single work all the stage effects of an entire literary generation bloody tyrants shameful murders vows of vengeance missing documents entrapped maidens duels and combats of six incessant hairbreadth escapes bravoes outlaws monks all these and other familiar machinery are to be found in the lawyers daughter virtue triumphs over vice too in thc end in the famous old fashion but even this attraction will not wtc are afraid ensure to mr trollope a large number of admiring readers were mr trollope a much better writer than he is he could not force the british public to an interest in this sort of thing now elsewhere it is different oeeasionally if georg ebers likes to devote himself to the manufacture of old egyptian and carly christian novels he knows that in scholastic germany he addresses a larg circle of readers who will like him all the better for thc fact that there is no one else living who could combine the ability to tell a good story with such appalling erudition if on the other hand m xavier dc montepin or paul feval likes to drop back a few centuries and to clothe his  hollow puppets  in some more graceful garb than ours  if the eighteenth century delight m amadce achard or the sixteenth ponson du terrail these authors know their pappenheimers and they possess so strongly the art of storytelling that they must always be vivacious and readable  their characters wear well the garments of aa ancient epoch and if they do not differ much from the parisian of today they move about with thc theatrical easo and grace which he can wear so well either before the world or at the bal de it opera but we in england must frankly admit ourselves inferior to france in storytelling to germany in erudition  in other words we want nowadays both the qualities which best excuse the historical novel as well as the willingness to read it our writers of the present day will not take the trouble which is essential to such a work  they will not labour like scott or thackeray or bulwer lytton and they do not produce a  quentin durward an  esmond or even a  last days of pompeii they are not of course to bo blamed for doing the work that suits them best and we should be very sorry to think that england boasted a miss mulbach among her novelists the epoch of the historical novel is as far as we can see passed away in england and  the lawyers daughter is scarcely likely to succeed when  romola  failed yet there is not wanting a certain feeling of pleasure in an age of robertson and jules verne of teacup and saucer and the fairy tales of science in finding some one bold enough to take delight in the good oldfashioned elements of romance and naive enough to hope for a sympathetic and attentive audience one quotation will be enough to give an idea of the work presently as the great beu of the campanella of st mark tolled though midnight hour two tall figures turned the righthand corner of though old wall of st francesco della vifirna muffled in large mantles  and almost aa punctually two other figures also cloaked carno round from though left and both parties met on the platform and saluted each other if not cordially at all events politelyeverything being arranged between the seconds and the combatants placed with a fair regard to light though marcheso dobizzi dropped the point of his sword and said in a calm steady voice addressing the seconds  this

assertion should it bo my fate to die i wish you gentlemen to observe should theso be my last words that as i hope for salvation i do most solemnly belie vo the assertion i have made to be most true while the marches spoke there might bo seen a slight degree of nervous agitation in the features of the count de st felix he seemed to press hia lips hard and though hand that held his sword was slightly agitated however as the marchese ended he said in a sharp tone  let us waste no moro of that chaste ladys light pointing to though moon  for in ten minutes she will bo behind though campanile of st mark and our shadows may obstruct us  ten minutes returned the marcheso coldly  will bo quite enough for our purpose  ha say you so then havo at you my lord marchese and though samo instant though swords crossed this sort of thing ought only to make its appearance now in the weekly instalments of some obscure periodical were it as veil written as if it were by the elder dumas himself it would not go down but when it appears in a threevolume novel by an evidently inexperienced writer the anachronism is only too glaringly absurd wc should like to warn mr frank trollope that nobody now cares about old venice or the doge or the council of ten about moonlight squares and sombre streets about mysterious appointments desperate duels and the fierce hates and fiercer loves which charmed our grandfathers and grandmothers neither the melancholy lover nor the wicked baron would be tolerated now for a single instant thc lantern jaws of the one and the buff boots of the other will not meet even with the kindly respect due to their dignified antiquity but only with ribald laughter or unconcealed indifference no one now cares to walk in that imagination street where thackerays j j loved to stray thc street where lovely ladies look from balconies where cavaliers strike mandolins and draw swords and engage where long processions pass and venerable hermits with long beards bless the kneeling people where the rude soldiers swaggering through the place with flags and halberts and fife and dance seize the slim waists of the daughters of the people and bid thc pifferan play to their dancing who cares now for though fate of manfroni the onehanded monk for abellino though bravo of venice  whose eyes moisten now for thaddeus of warsaw or  looking on darkness see with horror the hideous effigy of death which makes udolpho terrible if mr trollope wishes to be read he had better either follow the example of his more distinguished namesake or make a hero of a gasmeter or a guardsman the path of literature which has been hallowed by thc tread of rhoda broughton he may not hope to enter on success there seems to be reserved for women but let him devote whatever talents he may possess to those subjects which the age will read to attempt to revive a taste for the historical novel is almost as heroic quite as hopeless and quite as ludicrous as would be the effort to

B6334,"['6793219', '6797996', '8985191']",  fiction the waters of edera by ouida t fisher unwin 6s this book belongs to the later italian series of ouidas novels it is now close upon forty years since her first work held in bondage was issued nevertheless the imaginative force of her last gives no sign of decadence the story is indeed powerful and one can conceive that it was thrown off with masterful ease as victor hugo might have thrown it offwriting in bold scratching strokes at a plain wooden desk such is ones impression ouida takes an italian valley and shows in depicting the life of the peasants therein that their very existence depended on the river edera which watered it then she moves forward a  foreign syndicate who for their own sinister commercial ends wished to divert the stream there was a fierce struggle between the country party and the town party but of course the squadrons of commerce gained the victory the river was diverted the valley ruined and the syndicate lapped in gold incidentally there were a number of murders and two suicides those of the hero and his mother adoneproprietor of the valley is one of ouidas beautiful heroes and she has given him a heroine to match some of the pictures of the latter are charming she was only a child and her spirits rose and she capered about in the shallows and flung the water over her head and danced to her own reflection in it and forgot her sorrow then she washed her petticoats as well as she could having nothing but water alone and all the while she was as naked as a naiad and the sun smiled on her brown thin childish body as it smiled on a stem of plaintain or on the plumage of a coot then when she had washed her skirt she spread it out on the sand to dry and sat down beside it for the heat to bake her limbs after her long bath there was no one and there was nothing in sight if any came near she could hide under the great dock leaves uatil such should have passed it was high noon and the skirt of wool and the skirt of hemp grew hot and steamed under the vertical rays she was soon as dry as the shingles from which the water had receded for months she sat with her hands clasped round her updrawn knees and her head grew heavy with the want of slumber but she would not sleep though it was the hour of sleep some one might pass by and steal her clothes she thought and how or when would she ever get others the whole book is full of the appreciation of free natural beauty and the passionate hate of cruelty and oppression it is unconventional in a large rather fine manner full of lofty scorn and noble dignity it is yet rather pathetic in its ignorances and its prejudices for ouida a thing is still either wholly good or wholly bad there is nothing between her emotions have an almost tragic splendour but her thinking is crude artistically the novel has one chief defect it is not woven with sufficient closeness its meshes are too big to hold fast the reader otherwise it is admirable despite the somewhat crowded disasters at the end  notes on novels these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the waters of edera by ouida the scene of ouidas new novel is laid in italy where we find a commercial company bent on diverting the course of a river thus reducing a village to destitution the principal character is a priest don silvano and the exploring eye finds passages like this  as they bound the sheaves and bore the waterjars and went in groups through the seeding grass to chapel or fountain or shrine they had the free frank grace of an earlier time just suoh as these had carried the votive doves to the altars of venus and chanted by the waters of edera the worship of isis and her son a story of strong passions and purposes methuen 6s  the waters of edera new novels by ouida fisher unwin ouida in pursuance of her selfimposed mission to castigate the shortcomings of local administration in italy gives us another of the rather squalid rural tragedies which have replaced the gorgeous visions of her earlier manner no more do heroic guardsmen lap curacao like tea no more do hungarian magnates woo passionate ladies in palaces by the mediterranean shore or on inaccessible alpine ridges the day for these toys is gone instead of them we have a simple though unattractive peasantry residing in a district of italy which the very abundance of the data makes it hard to identify it had been etruscan it had been latin it had been longobardo it had been borgian and papal it was visited by asdrubal and burned by alaric it had been counted as one of the fiefs comprised in the possessions of the pentapolis but masses of marble and snow lay between it and the patrimonium petrus at the same time it had in the good old days when no corrupt bureaucracy interfered with the pleasures of the people been a favourite resort of the great brigands of the upper abruzzo indeed it is situated on the south of the marches on the confines of what is now the territorial division of the abruzzomolese the puzzle is find valdedera the population is sparse its chief occupation seems to consist in leaving the soil to itself its relaxation on sundays and saints days in setting rams to fight its habits are as filthy as the terms used by the author to convey an idea of them among these people lives a young man named adone the beautiful greek adonais having passed t into the number of the saints of the latin church a small proprietor with vague claims to descent from the old feudal lords of the place and undefined rights over a stretch of the river a company formed to manufacture acetylene obtains the permission of the district authorities to divert the river adone stimulates the peasants to resist by force of arms soldiers are sent one squad is guided into a bog by a girl whom adone and his mother have befriended and perishes to a man the rioters are captured adone escapes and drowns himself the priest of the village who has done his best to dissuade his parishioners from violence is tried on the charge of aiding and abetting but acquitted and in the last page is made for no very apparent reason a cardinal the story it will be seen is fairly thin there are iu it as in most of ouidas books passages not devoid of vigour but as usual with her vigour easily passes into violence while the coarseness of expression which has become inveterate mars her work just where it might be most telling,dom
B1982,"['8978427', '6893476', '8968197']",  the bet and other stories by anton tchekhov translated by s koteliansky f and j m murry   modern russian library maunsel  co 3 od net this volume of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may not recognise the reference to griboyedovs4 gorye ot uma on p 41 as 4 the sorrows of knowledge the title of the english translation of this famous play is 4 the misfortune of being clever  the kiss and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in english  another would be sleeping or sitting at home with guests taribari rastabari talking but he the daylong circles about the steppe  nineteen to the dozen would be roughly equivalent to the peculiar words  clhtchedrine  is an unpronounceable version of the name of the satirist shchedrin a few notes would have been helpful an english reader cannot be expected to know who is a  milkite or

confess to some disappointment at the explanation towards the close of the book of the mystery connected with mrs clennam and dte old house with its strange noises it is deficient in clearness and doe not fulfil the expectations of the reader which have been wound up to a high pitch indeed the woof of the entire story does not hold together with sufficient closenessa fault perhaps inseparable from the mode of publics tion the writing however shows all mr dickenss singular union of close observation arad rich fancy a few instances suggest themselves as e wurite of jeremiah flintwinch whose head is always on one side so that the knotted ends of his cravat dangle under one ear and who has a swollen and suffused look we arc told that he had a weird appearance of having hanged himself at one time or other and of having gone about ever since halter and all exactly as some timely hand had cut him down the watch worn by the same old man was deposited in a deep pocket  and had a tarnished

itself evenly and slowly the light of this fire throws the shadows of airs clennam old flintwinch and his wife mistress affiery on a gateway opposite like figures from a magic lantern i as the

witchregion of sleep bhis is true poetry but there are a thousand such touches in the book as in all mr dickesas books which ever reader of cultivated pelceptions will perceive for himself in little onrrit mr dickens has made another imperishable addition to the literature of his country  little dorrit new novels by charles dickens bradbury and evans dark and fair by the author of  rockingham 3

chapman and hall the atlielings or tfie three gifts by margaret oliphant 3 vols blackwood tte professor by currer bell 2 vols smith and elder the completion of a periodical by charles dickens has usually been regarded with sensations similar to those with which we witness the last glass poured from a bottle of good claret or contemplate the preparations for breaking up a pleasant family circle in the novel we have it is true one compensation which does not occur in the other cases against the annoyance of parting with our friend we have to set the gratification of our curiosity revelling in the solution of some mystery which has tantalised it at intervals during the space of twenty months the familiar green cover no longer makes its appearance to be snatched at and eagerly read while the other serials and magazines lie neglected and uncut but on the other hand we know all about itwe are informed of the relationships legitimate or illegitimate of the dramatis personalwe have the satisfaction of feeling that the proper people are made happy and that the murderer is detected and exposed when we say that the above sentences which describe with sufficient fidelity the reception which mr dickenss novels have usually met with are in no respect applicable to the case of  little dorrit we believe we are only giving a voice to the dissatisfaction which the story even very soon after its commencement began to excite and which has been brought to a head hy its extremely lame and impotent conclusion in a preface which he vainly strives to divest of the air of an apology mr dickens assures us that he has more readers than ever we are far from doubting the assertion  we can only say that it proves very little if any thing at all the number of novelreaders increases so largely every year that a great many inferior writers could make a similar boast the material questions to ask are does mr dickens keep his plat e in comparison with other novelists are all his old subscribers faithful to him  is his present public an addition to or in part a substitution for his former onol unless these questions can be auswered in the affirmative we submit that the mere fact of an increased sale is no proof of real and enduring popularity  least of nil of such a popularity as a man of mr dickenss genius ought if he does himself justice to demand and receive at our hands mr dickens and his critics will respectively  speak as they find we can only say that in a tolerably large and very miscellaneous acquaintance we have found that the greater number of persons have either left off reading little dorrit after two or three numbers or if they have persevered to the end have in the end unanimously condemned it we will hs briefly as possible indicate the grounds on which we are for the most part inclined to agree with them that mr dickenss genius is wholly comic and that his proper line is to speak roundly rather that of the buffoon than of the tragedian a view frequently held and set forth with remarkable ability in a recent number of blackwoodis a proposition we are disposed wholly to deny those who would affirm it consider pickwick his greatest work and every other of his tales inferior in proportion as it recedes from the pickwickian standard according to such critics mr dickens was bound to  draw all the stableyards in london for comic ostlers and all the suburbs for humorous retired linendrapers and plethoric coachmen before presuming to strike out a new line and attempt to excite other emotions than those of laughter he was to be ant democritus aut nullvs these persons do not reflect that such a law if applied to other artists who have done well would have deprived the world of all the novels of scott and half the poetry of byron and goethe eschylus might have been told to stick to his ships and not attempt to exhibit the persians ns well as conquer them if a man can make us laugh the probability is that he can make us ciy  indeed it is not unlikely  though wit may flash from fluent lips and mirth distract the breast that he cries himself much oftener than his friends imagine not to pursuethistheme beyond reasonable limits we hold that mr dickens was not only perfectly right to attempt something of an extrapickwickian nature but that moreover he has succeeded in producing it he has not only excited laughter but teais and shuddering far from having retrograded because he ceased to confine himself to exhibiting the salient points of exceptional characters the peculiarities of speech and gesture and the rich absurdities which so often pass before us and are forgotten he made decided and valuable steps as an artist and a describer of life in bringing before us the pathos of the old curiosity shop the powerful and thrilling description which raises martin chvzzleunt above every similar chronicle of murder and in sounding the deep moral abyss of meditated crime which in bleak house opens before the recoiling eyes of lady dedlock to have adequately grasped and embodied in fiction not the oddities which arc peculiar to each but the emotions which are common to all and while generalising the latter sufficiently to excite wide sympathy to have individualised them so as to accord with the idiosyncrasy of the characters by whom they were respectively manifestedis not a retrogression but an advance and one which lifts the author who makes it out of the comparatively low rank of comic writers and sets him in the same category at however great an interval as homer scott and shakspeare and to  expostulate  with him for wiping the paint from his face and scold him for aspiring to the high moral elevations on which he has so successfully tried his powers is as sensible as to expect a coquette not to exercise her powers of fascination or a soldier to box with his fists when he is armed with a revolver coincidently however with the exhibition of the remarkable creations to which we have adverted mr dickens has developed two characteristics which go far to neutralise the admiration which such great merits are calculated to excite in the first place the comic veiu which flowed so abundantly in pickwick has in later works run with a weaker and a drier stream like the sherry in leechs caricature it has be come a udder and a thinner wineby the addition of much water and some other very unpleasant ingredients his comic characters have become more and more exceptional and iu some cases the emotion they create is simply that of disgust they have every year less resemblance to human nature and the amusement if any which they excite is by degrees more dependent upon some quaintness of manner or speech which might serve once or twice but is reiterated ad nauseam whenever they make their appearance and less upon that display of the inward nature which properly constitutes humour place oue of these hideous beiugs by the side of an earlier charaoter and the contrast will be like that of passing from a stall at the haymarket when buokstone is playing to the grating of a cell in bedlam imagine the family of the smallweeds introduced to the genial society of sam weller or even of the bath footman  they would have been kicked out instantly and as for mr weller senior he would havesat upon them these wretched creaturesand they are not the only instance in mr dickenss later writingsexemplify another fault which seems io be growing upon himthat of choosing to describe people who are not so properly comic as fantastic and as frequently remarkable for physical infirmity as for mental absurdity where is the fun of laughing at a dwarf au idiot or a paralytic  or what purpose can be served by the exhibition iu the same novel of the hideous beast who slowly soddens himself with strong drink and the nauseous chemical components of whose person stream down through the floor to regale his fellowlodgers after his spontaneous combustion  whether the promotion of good feeling between the different classes of societythe trump card of mr dickenss schoolbe likely to be attained by his writings is another very doubtful point if he has succeeded in showing the upper class that there is a great deal of good in the lower he has certainly shown the lower that there is a great deal of bad in the one above them all his allusions to the higher ranks of society are distinguished by a spirit not of satire but of illnatured sarcasm which seems to be roused quite as much by mere differences of habits and manners as by any deficiency in respect of moral qualities formerly he laid his task on all alike and visited selfishness or cruelty with its due punishment in whatever quarter it might be fouud now he exclusively appeals to the gallery and tells them that all the virtues are to be found only south of the thames and west of tottenham court road extrema per illos justina excedeus terris vertigii fecit and has left to their deserved fate the regions of whitehall and belgravia utterly incapable of managing the business of the country which should be exclusively entrusted to the hands of the virtuous shopkeeper and the intelligent mechanic and this brings us to the second fault which we have mentioned as observable in his later works in saying that it is absurd to require that a novelist should restrict himself to the delineation of one special part of humanity we do not therefore imply that he is to rush blindly into a number of other subjects which are not in themselves pectiliarly appropriate to fiction and which besides are not to be understood by the light of nature alone now mr dickens being gifted with a keen observation ready sympathies an effective style and a good knowledge of certain limited sections of english life has on this slender stock of materials set up latterly as a social reformer there is in his works no evidence of any reading of the sort which is usually considered necessary for comprehending law politics or education and there is no method of instruction as at present practised on which he has not bestowed some very telling and malignant sneers nor does he seem to have paid much attention to business or to take much part in any of these matters except as connected with charitable objects in the promotion of which his bitterest enemy could not deny him to be meritoriously distinguished in spite however of these very obvious deficiencies he has come forward for the instruction of the public and his views have found very general acceptance with the class of persons who take their politics from punch and never open a serious book but are happy to raise their voices in any cry which their favourite novelist will suggest to them mr dickens is quite as destructive in his tendencies as mr carlyle but he is not quite so courageous the author of latterday pamphlets attacked the public offices when no one else thought of saying a word against them mr dickens prefers to kick an institution when it is down or at least when it is being taken down to be mended when some one else has scotched the snake he comes and sets his heel upon it but he is not the man to drag it out of its hole into the light of day enough however on this subject were we to pursue it further we should only be going over the objections which have been already set forth in our opinion with perfect justice by the saturday and edinburgh reviews and which mr dickenss sworn band of followers in the weekly press have been unable to controvert except either by the clumsy adulation which a man with mr dickenss sense of humour doubt less appreciates at its true value or by the same sort of swaggering impertinence by which they have tried to bully the public into posthumous admiration for their hero the late mr jerrold the chief objection which on our own part we have to make to little dorrit is that as a story it is insufferably dull and that it does not contain a single character whom we can love admire or respect the heroine herself who is evidently meant to be an embodiment of all that is charming and meritorious in woman has we regret to say failed to touch our feelings she seems merely a fresh version of esther summerson and from her perfections almost as remote from our sympathies as that very priggish character we tyre of hearing aristides called just and we would give the world for little dorrit to make a little mistake short of a faux pas or commit herself in some way so as to be brought down to the level of ordinary mortals so muoh moral sunshine is wearisome and as colton said of religion we would die for it fight for it spend for itanything but live with it and as has been acutely remarked by one of our contemporaries  her size is against hershe is made almost quaint in this instance  the virtuous marcia does not  tower above her sex aud the effect is detrimental to her her sister is almost preferable notwithstanding her coquetry it would have been only charitable to have given this young lady an opportunity of becoming something better but mr dickens with his passion for stereotypes gives her in marriage to one who is little better than an idiot and over the rest of her life draws a veil which no one who knows what this kind of marriage generally comes to will like to lift of the remaining characters mr dorrit himself is much the best his meanness in adversity and his contemptible insolence in prosperity are excellently described one of the best scenes in the b wk is the one where john chivery brings his offering of cigars to the old man who had been only too glad of such gifts in his marshalsea state of existence but with true snobbishness is now afraid of being compromised by communication with such a low fellow as  youug john to the whole account too of mr merdles career the highest praise may be given the account of his suicide and the state of the public mind upon the occasion is in mr dickenss most finished and telling style it is lucky that we have these characters aud scenes for it takes a good deal to compensate for the exhibition of such a grotesque absurdity as pancks whose perpetual steaming is one of the nuisances of the book and of such a hideous impossibility as mrs clennam we are it is true limier a certain disadvantage in criticising what this lady says and does because we do not very clearly understand the narrative which is meant to explain her conduct nor have we met with any one who does thucydides in his darkest moments was never more hopelessly obscure than mr dickens has contrived to be in the few pages where he professes to give the solution of the enigma on which we have been allowed to expend our ingenuity through so many previous numbers we have heard of the old gentlemau who taught his grandson draughts till his pupil beat him and we think that the author of the dead secret has set his master an example of neatness in the development of plot and of lucid explanation when there is no longer any necessity for concealment which the author of little dorrit would have done well to copy in the latter work we are distracted with a variety of threads which never seem to converge and tantalised so long with the mystery suggested in the outset that we overstay our appetite for it and it is then presented in such a form that to make head or tail of it must require a far severer exercise of the analytical faculty than most novelreaders will care to undertake like the champagne which mr albert smith carried with him to the summit of mont blanc it foams out in one unintelligible spirt delivered in far too startling and hysterical a fashion for any thing like enjoyment mr dickens has never been eminent for the judicious management of his plots having probably preferred to depend for success on brilliant execution and picturesqueness of characterisation he seems to have written this story from month to month and either never to have clearly conceived the development of it beforehand or if he formed a plan not to have cared to adhere to it this practice while it of course gives opportunities for working up any fire or railway accident that may occur in the interval is not particularly favourable to the unity and comprehensibility of a novel whether mr dickens has gained any thing by impressing into his service the fall of the houses in tottenham court road is a question which will easily be answered by any one who reads little dorrit a year or two hence when the dust of that frightful accident shall have finally cleared off for our own parts we do not see any moral lesson in killing off your villain in a fortuitous manner totally unconnected with any thing he has done or means to do ii real life the wicked often go on  flourishing like a green baytree poetical justice disposes of them in some way appropriate to their crimes and pursuits but to make use of a mere accident for this purpose is to miss both the truth of realism and the satisfaction of romance if mr dickens has not met with his wonted success in appealing to our feelings of pity and terror still less has he attained it by that exuberance of comic humours which has so often lightened the hearts and brightened the eyes of his readers what there is of comedy in little dorrit must we suppose be referred to the characters of flora mr rs aunt and the redoubtable mr pancks the latter is simply a bore who comes on the stage makes his accustomed grimace and disappears the aunt is in a certain way ridiculous but after all affords only the same kind of amusement that is produced by the vagaries of a drunken man flora is a weak reproduction of mrs nickleby without mrs nicklebys resemblance to nature even the names of the characters are hardly so happy as usual what facetiousness is there in calling a woman  mrs generala name simply unmeaning and absurd with not even probability to recommend it there is something too ia the sound of  clennam and  meagles which is positively nasty the london directory which has so often assisted mr dickens might surely have supplied him with something more appropriate than these in making the above remarks we are not unmindful of the fact that an author of established merit ought not even when he makes a slip to be visited with the castigation due to a mere pretender in literature but there are one or two points in little dorrit which go far to disentitle its author even to this allowance in the first place while some of the best and oldest blood in the country was being lavishly poured forth in the crimea he waa unpatriotic enough to hold up the enemy with whom england was at war as the model of all that england ought to imitate in the next place in the full face of the robson and redpath frauds of peculation and adulteration in almost every department of trade and commerce and in strange inconsistency with his portraiture of mr merdle he describes the middle and lower classes exclusively as the embodiment of all that is highminded and straightforward in business probably all associations are liable to the same faults of divided responsibility and official insolence if mr dickens has found that railway companies boards of directors and their underlings and other public bodies of a similar description are less obstructive and more courteous than the clerks at whitehall we can only say that he has been much more fortunate than the rest of mankind in criticising his present work we have of course judged him by the standard he has created and the taste he has formed little dorrit which might make an inferior man famous is very very far below the merit of what its author has almost uniformly taught us to expect from him in his present story the author of rockingham has produced a tale of less romantic interest than those by which he is already known  but he exhibits greater oommand over his materials more knowledge of his art and if possible greater fluency of style the plot is as follows sir charles rockingham a man of fortune and once of fashion has retired to his estate in the country in consequence of some disappointment as to which we are not particularly informed at the commencement of the story he receives a letter from a female relative proposing to make herself and her daughter miss lavinia dieaway his guests in order that the young lady may be diverted from an undesirable attachment which she has formed for her cousin lord walter dieaway the ladies arrive and the lovely young lavinia having gained sir charless sympathies by her gentleness and distress is beginning to become a little reconciled to her separation when her intimate friend lady camilla dareall arrives in company with lord walter and establishes herself in rockingham hall their host though subjected to a good deal of teasing by the lovers and their ally manages to hold his difficult position between miss lavinias mamma and the opposite prty with much success and there appears some hope that the marriage will be allowed to take place when it is suddenly broken off by the discovery of an intrigue in which lord walter has been engaged with a fashionable london demirep lady camilla and the faithless lover immediately depart for london and the  dark  beauty is left to be consoled by sir charles whether he succeeds in this laudable attempt or whether the truant admirer is recalled and the  fair camilla installed as mistress of rockingham hall are matters involved in considerable doubt at this stage of the story and we shall consult the readers chance of being interested by leaving them unexplained assuring him that the uncertainty is very ably kept up till the exigencies of the closing third volume oblige it to be resolved in a manner highly agreeable to all parties concerned the author of this novel has ventured on the difficult task of depicting fashionable people of the present day in their everyday habits and conversation and though the machinery he has adopted for this purpose demands a good deal of faith at the outset he must be said to have achieved a signal success he has described the sayings and doings of persons belonging to a tyj of which hundreds may be met with every day in the season in a manner which sustains the readers expectation from beginning to end on what seems a very slender stock of materials aud keeps him amused by a stream of persiflage which is always smart without lieiug positively witty and is lively and piquant without ever approaching the confines of vulgarity to take four persons one a clever highminded and amiable gentleman one a beautiful and affectionate girl but not possessing much character one a fast young lady of the  kate coventry order  one a cool vain stupid goodhumoured and impenetrable man of fashion whose chief characteristic is an inability to jonounce the letter r and whose chief idea is his  dwag and to make them talk through the greater part of three volumes so as not to bore or annoy a reader but on the contrary to excite his curiosity and arouse his interest is a great effort and one which even men of more genius than the author of rockingham would find it hard to accomplish dark and fair is in fact a genteel comedy with connecting elucidations in which the business that occurs between the nets is agreeably told the actors are sot described but made to exhibit themselves by what they say in a manner which is less common than it ought to be  and the peculiarity of lord walters pronunciation is so managed as to have a surpassingly ludicrous effect the bachelor who enjoys the perusal of this amusing book over his evening cigar will doubtless lose his heart to one or other of its heroines and be apt to think that a drawingroom in which either vinny or  cammy should be the presiding spirit might be a more desirable nest than even the luxurious smokingroom of his club barcliester towersthis book is a continuation of tm warden but it far surpasses its predecessor iu all the qualities which contribute to the goodness of a novel the warden was the work of a man with much sense of humour and a good deal of observation but it resembled too strongly certain polemical stories which were fashionable a few years ago and presented too wild a species of interest in the development of its narrative to meet with the appreciation to which its merits would otherwise have entitled it barcheskr towers is not liable to either of these objections and the only drawback likely to affect its general popularity is the iaat that it is a continuation of another less meritorious story mr trollope is no longer polemical except to a certain degree in favour of what is sometimes called the  highanddry school of church orthodoxy in other respects he wields a free lance and exposes the absurdities and shortcomings both of tractarian and evangelical divines with a wonderful and almost wicked impartiality the elements of interest in his present tale are more of the stamp usual in novels than was the case with thc warden  mr harding is less prominent and love and matrimony in the person of the charming mrs bold widow resume the supremacy which they are entitled to expect at the novelists hands the story is still concerned with the wardenship of the hospital but the question of the appointment is complicated with that of another post for which there is an equally strong competitionthat of husband to the fair eleanor bold one suitor is the chaplain to the new bishop of barchester mr slope a succulent evangelical parson something like a young vicar of wrexhill whose object it is to obtain the wardenship for mr harding in order to ingratiate himself with his daughter mr slope would have the appointment in his own hands but the bishop dr proud ie is henpecked and the appointment of warden ls the battlefield o which the superiority of mrs proudie or the chaplain is to be decided mrs proudies candidate is mr quiverful whose name expresses tl io conjugal fecundity which makes a post of  1500 ayear so desirable in the pursuit of eleaner bold however mr slope has two rivals first bertie stanhope the lazy clever cool impertinent italianized son of one of the canons of the cathedral whose family have spent most of their lives on the continent and are recalled into residence by the new bishop berties courtship is undertaken because he has tried various professions aud that of consort seems to be the only one left open to him he has not a bad chance in some respects for one of his sisters who is worldly and manoeuvring makes herself the friend of eleanor while the other who like so many charming women is separated from her husband and endowed with all the equivocal fascination which that position generally implies entangles mr slope in an unlawful flirtation and drives him as near to the verge of desperation as a low church clergyman can possibly go matters are in this state when a third admirer appears in the person of mr arabin a trained oxford divine who has been sent for by mr hardings friends to counteract the influence of mr slope were we dealing with any other novel we should be satisfied with having told the story thus far and take care not to forestall the readers interest by pursuing it to the end mr trollope however tells us in so many words that he has uo objection to his conclusion being divulged and himself in dicates long before the end of the third volume the fate of the characters about whom we are most interested he thus claims the high merit of being able to induce us to proceed by his mere manner of telling the story  and we are able to say that he has not claimed more than is his due his neat clear and vigorous style his sensible aphorisms and general brilliancy of execution are sufficient to draw a reader on although he knows that the lady is far too good for such a creature as mr slope to be allowed to carry off and is given pretty clearly to understand that mr arabin is at last to make a vacancy among the fellows of his college mr trollopes style frequently reminds us bf thackeray and his views of life are not unlike those which the great moralist is fond of inculcating they are healthy free from cant and with a leaning to the domestic and comfortable side of human existence not without the humorists smile at its romantic aspirations and its prosaic realities mr trollope takes any thing but an ordinary novelists view of life or he would have taken care not to make his heroine a widow it is not easy to feel enthusiasm about a widow however delightful certain individuals of the genus may sometimes prove colonel hamley has depicted a charming specimen in his lady lee but half the interest with which we contemplate her arises from one being told that her first marriage has not been one of affection eleanor bold however is described as having been sincerely attached to her first husband  and this fact coupled with her readiness to think of a second engagement so soon afterwards rather detraots from the freshness which one naturally expects to belong to the central figure of a story like barchester 2owers it will not be long we hope before mr trollope favours us with another story and then perhaps he will give the spinsters a turn mrs gores novel of the two aristocracies is a great improvement on the last work from her pen which we lately had the honour of criticising a lifes lessons though not otherwise than a clever story was in parts exceedingly dull a fault which certainly cannot be charged on the present story sparkling as it does with much of the ancient brilliancy which the writer of cecil showed she could employ at need agnoscimns vetens vestigia flamtnos whether this pyrotechny is employed for an equally legitimate purpose may be matter of more doubt the  two aristocracies  are of course those of birth and wealth and the tie which connects them is that of marriage mark barneson the son of an apothcary is employed as clerk by a great ironmaster whom he succeeds in business and one of whose daughters he marries the other is ambitious and marries a certain lord arden mark barnesons daughter at a later period inspires a mutual attaohment in another nobleman a younger son the greater part of the book is taken up in delineating the rapacity of lord arden as regards his wifes fortune and of the family of miss barnesons lover as regards hers the middle class and manufacturing interest being for the most part represented as distinguished by probity and disintereduess and the class to which lord arden belongs by the opposite qualities mrs gore seems to have been taking a leaf out of mr dickenss book but has outdone him in vituperation aud fallen short of him in truth for the imputation of official incapacity and offensive hauteur as applied to the aristocracy there is a foundation for that of trickery and double dealing in money matters we are persuaded there is none with thin exception and that of a country family whoso members are made scheming and disagreeable to an absurd and untruthful extent the personages are probable lifelike and well finished and though there is no hero the book is unquestionably very readable and amusing its faults in addition to what we have stated which are of course matters of opinionare that there is no one person at once amiable and clever enough to excite really strong interest in his fate and that at an important crisis in the story the dramatis personae are described as acting in a manner which we are morally convince is contrary to all probability take for instance the following dialogue say whether as regards the italicised portion the actors are not made mere puppets  i am not afraid rejoined the young lady looking him resolutely in the feice  into this house mr ferrier  the literary examiner little dorrit bv charles dickens bradbury and evans of all mr dickenss novels little dorrit is pernaps me one that takes the highest aim we are among those who read the first chapter eighteen months ago and the last chapter but yesterday during the publication of the tale in monthly numbers we have enjoyed it much and grumbled at it much it is complete aud what was dark is clear to us what matter was confused we find as many arrows loosed several ways fly to one mark in this novel mr dickens has thought more of his single volume than of his twenty parts resisting most completely the temptations which lead to the final hurt of many a book published in fragments little dorrit has been the less appreciated for this reason as fugitive reading but it will be only the more appreciated as a permanent addition to our libraries we do not hold it to be either mr dickenss best or his worst work but as we have said we believe it to be of all others as to its aim the highest and we may add also as to its manner of construction the one that is most characteristic of his genius its aim from which never a shaft diverges is to 6how the beautyeven the sublimityof a simple unaffected and unselfish doing of all duties great and little the ugliness and baseness of the qualities that are antagonist to this little dorrit is the subject of the novel and she means duty as in spenser una means truth or duessa falsehood the words do it begin and end possibly not by accident her very name her character the character of duty runs as a golden thread through the whole story the tale is dividedno scheme could be simplerinto two parts poverty and wealth through poverty and wealth the golden thread of duty runs ever the same little dorrit is tried by endurance of the lowest depths of want hopeless confinement in a debtors prison and is then submitted to the test of an abrupt change from want to wealth the golden thread runs on without a break without a bend little dorrit is then tried with gold and afterwards submitted to the test of an abrupt fall from wealth to poverty she mounts up to heaven she goes down again into the depths but her soul is not melted because of trouble the even line of duty never is turned to the right hand or to the left then again we have in little dorrits character the nature of dutythe forgetfulness of self the thoughtfulness for others the constant patience the noiseless endeavour to be straightforward and right in little as in great things and the habit of doing everything in the most kindly manner selfish relations do not weaken in her heart the filial tie she is laughed at patronised nominally held in low esteem but she wins more or less of love and reverence from all and in an hour of need even those who affect to laugh at her rely upon the wisdom of her counsels around the path of little dorrit whose life shows us how duty is done are grouped illustrations of the way in which it is left undone there is the circumlocution office specially bent on the solution of its problem how not to do lt there is mr merdle doing nothing in the world of commerce yet contriving to amass a fortunebut no stable fortuneby the fcfce of selfishness by pushing his way on rather than working it on totally regardless of all claims of duty there is mr casby doing no duty in life but subsisting blandly on a reputation for benevolence while he can get even extortion done on his behalf by a paid deputy there is mi ss wade doing no duty in life but tormenting herself with a selfish delusion by which she is made useless to society there is tattycoram needing the same wholesome lesson and receiving it at last in homely words of truth from mr meagles there is mrs c len nam wasting her years as a victim to that intense form of selfishness which gets from a misread bible justification of its evil passions and professes to leave duty undone in the name of god there is henry gowan a painter who gives no toil to his calling a man who has no purpose before bim who is not to be made happy by the fairest gift of fortune and upon whose married life there may well come the shadow of blandois of paris as little dorrit represents in the book the angel of duty so in blandois we have the demon ol selfish idleness his smile that is a sneer and his white bands that never have been applied to labour are the con stantly recurring emblems of his character in passages o persons description he is a gentleman for whom others must work to whom others must give way who regards none ss certainly as little dorrit regards all if little dorrit be the una he is the duessa of the tale we do not mean for a moment to assert that in writing this novel or sny other of his novels mr dickens bas proposed to himself to construct an allegory as complete in all details as that of sny book in spensers faerie queene upon that principle no novel of modern life could possibly be written but mr dickens as most readers have felt is st once poet and storyteller many of his paragraphs happen indeed to be really written in good verse though it is not in metre that their poetry consists it was not metre that made a poem of the tale of the old curiosity shop or of that portion of dombey and son which told the life and death of little paul from other english novelists we think that mr dickens may hereafter he distinguished as the one writing most habitually with the temper of a poet this it is in no slight degree which gives their peculiarity to nearly all the characters he paints they are personifications and as such their names pass constantly into our common speech as pleasant equivalents for the particular qualities they represent a particular form of hypocrisy in a man is expressed by calling him a pecksniff ora particular form of worthlessness in a statesman is expressed by calling him a barnacle of the sins of a class mrs gamp is an emblem  mr bumble is an emblem of another thing and mrmerdle of another in the same spirit a common abuse in statesmanship being seized and idealised is reproduced under the type of the circumlocution office every one of these personifications is to be taken rather as one of the elements of truth reduced to its pure state by the chemistry of genius than as the ordinary compound truth which enters into everyday life of course one may complain of a chemist who experiments on oxygen that it is air with the nitrogen improperly left out and so one may complain of mr dickenss sketch of the circumlocution office that it shows only half the constitution of the air in downing street in the same way too nearly all his characters may be pronounced monstrosities for nearly all the elements of which the world is made when seen alone can be seen only as monstrosities in nature we do not complain of the chemist for delighting us when be reduces to their essence a few compounds of dead matter nor need we complain of the poetor the novelist who chances to do poets workwhen he also reduces to their elements a few compounds of life in little dorrit we have the most perfect example of that principle of personification upon which consciously or unconsciously mr dickens generally constructs his characters and even his incidents and plots very often there is connected with each some typical circumstance such as the sneer and the white hands of blandois the pomposity and weakness of mr dorrits  hum  and  ha or the idea of a steam engine in reference to mr pancks who is a machine in mr casbys hands full of repressed energy by reason of the too much pressure he at last explodes in all personification this is a common and indeed a necessary and inevitable practice we are not sure also whether the same impulse which caused spenser to personify folly and vice under so many grotesque and monstrous forms is not that which has compelled mr dickens to create such dwarfs and dragons as a quilp a smallweed and a flintwincb we have called attention only to one point in discussing little dorrit the point from which we believe that a reader will best see the entire picture on the artists canvas and we are tempted now to illustrate a part of what we have been saying by reference to a point of similarity between two very different works mr dickenss little dorrit and the newcomes of mr thackeray when the story of the newcomes was appearing in its monthly parts very few readers could keep their attention fixed upon its purpose the author seemed almost to have no purpose and to be drifting about weakly with his characters there were not a few who gave up the reading of it in despair but the work being once collected and read as a whole proved to the surprise of many readers to be most remarkable for unity of plan  to be a novel in which mr thackeray bad taken the deepest and the truest views of life and in which he bad been working out with an unfaltering skill a single lesson its theme was marriage and in no chapter did the author lose sight of his purpose to contrast the right with the wrong foundations of domestic life that which had appeared like want of concentration in a detached part was found to belong intimatelyas words broken out of the middle of a sentence may belongto the simplicity and clearness of the whole the likeness between little dorrit and the newcomes in this one respect is obvious enough very lightly let us touch upon one other consideration we have said that little dorrit is to be regarded as the most characteristic of the works of mr dickens meaning thereby that it is the best example of the way in which his novels are constructed we need hardly remind any reader that it is characteristic also in a higher sense the spirit of the authors life is in his story what englishman does not know bow the fame won by the brilliant sport of genius in sketches by boz and pickwick filled ito authors heart not with a weak selfworship but with a deep sense of duty to be done from the moment when his name became a name to conquer with mr dickens has made only one use of its great influence as novelist as journalist in every honest way he bas steadily and day by day to the best of his knowledge and the utmoet of his talent been maintaining what is good attacking what is evil and bent wholly on the  doing of his duty i,dom

B3076,['8916587'],  polynesian mythology and ancient traditional history of the new zealand race as fur nished by their priests and chiefs london saturday march 10 1855 reviews by sir george grey late governorinchief of new zealand murray when the author of this curious volume arrived among the strange people whom it was his mission to govern and protect he found himself helpless and was wise enough to avow it he was governor of a land where the indomitable british lion had tougher work of it than that wonderful animal ever expected to rind governor grey was anxious to do his duty impartially by all his great difficulty lay in this that he could not communicate satisfactorily with the natives there was indeed no lack of interpreters to make intercourse easy between him and the petitioning or remonstrant aboriginals but the interpreters themselves were frequently at fault there was a language and there were legends and poetical fragments employed in the addresses of some of those who came to seek redress from the governor of which the most skilful interpreters could no more make sense than mr hamilton could of some of the greek choruses the talk about rights and wrongs land labour settlement and occupation was constantly perplexed by grave allusions to mythic periods of new zealand history by quotations of perfectly unintelligible proverbs and by snatches of poetical citations for the conclusions of which whereby alone sense could be made of the first half the governor had to seek among the people of the aptyawt ditrict though compilers who built up the  iliad and  odyssey out of the fragments sung by the rhapsodists had no such laborious task a9 that which governor grey undertook and achieved in mastering their difficult language nnd in gathering up the fragments of their ancient lore having subdued the rugged difficulties which lay in the way of his mastering the language the energetic governor made acquaintance with if we may so speak the aboriginal clerical gentlemen of the locality he did not as cardinal ximenes with the moorish hooks in spain wish to destroy all traces and history of the heathen paston the contrary he wished to preserve and draw profit from them he had not the feeling of dr cumming who in his finger of god so complacently congratulates the world on the destruction of the great alexandrian library if the first archbishop of mexico instead of burning all the pictorial records of anahuac had preserved them for future scholars to read and digest he perhaps would have given to the world some truths sacred and important and have thrown a light upon aztec paths along which the old messengers of truth may once nave walked we are then the more disposed to be grateful to governor grey for the arduous labour undergone it has by no means been without results of usefulness and amusement he has sat at the feet of tatooed gamaliels and learned a world of inconceivable nonsensebut nonsense in which there are such singular indications that it is but the corruption of the one and immutable truth as to at once give it importance and dignity from the lips of new zealand priests and cunning men he has gathered all the lore stored up in such garners the traditionary history of the land that  shall be great hereafter is stupendously absurd but as we have said there are indications wildly distorted that at some very remote period there was a better instruction than the natives have enjoyed until very recently when we read for instance of the fratricide tumatauenga we are reminded of him who first slew his brother the fact that it was god who first taught and enjoined prayer to man is also here confessed and when we learn of what wickedness  the disappearance of a great part of the dry land was the resultand how during the contest of opposing men  a great part of mother earth was submergedwe are reminded that even among these islanders the record of the dread visitation has not been altogether lost that with the preservation of the record a spirit of poetry has not been also lost the following passage will amply demonstrate  up to this time the vast heaven has still ever remained separated from his spouse the eurth yet their mutual love still continuesthe soft warm sighs of her loving bosom still ever rise up to him ascending from the woody mountains and valleys and men call these mists and the vast heaven as he mourns through the long nights his separation from his beloved drops frequent tears upon her bosom and men seeing these term them dewdrops governor greys book proves that scripture history is at the foundation of that of new zealand this is sometimes hard to discover but the fact appears not the less certain the details are dissimilar but the leading point of the stories is not to be mistakenas in the tale of the jealousy of the brothers of mauitikitikiotaranga wherein we recognise the muchenduring joseph the beauty of this lengthilynamed hero is described according to the prevailing taste of the locality and maidens are admiringly told of him thai the skin on his hips looked mottled and beautiful as that of a mackerel from the tatoomarks cut on it by the chisel of uetonga in these traditionary stories the old truth is perverted in more ways than one and not only are the deeds of old distorted in the telling but the acts of many are heaped upon one individual thus it is said of maui the joseph of the last story that but for a certain matter recounted in a very long and very prosy legend no more human beings would have died but death itself would have been destroyed but the story of joseph is more easily traceable in the legend of tawhaki of whom not his brothers indeed but his brothersinlaw were jealous and by these he was half slain and cast into a pit only to rise to more exalted greatness than ever in like manner we have the story of sarah and hagar in that of the jealousy of the wives of tinirau against the young stranger whom he took to himself as an additional wife few if any of the touching episodes of holy writ are traceable in these wild legends and though some of them describe characters that are not void of good qualities yet we do not find among them such men as isaac and ishmael who though foes and of opposite religious faiths yet became reconciled over the dead body of a father the traces of classical and romantic stories are equally to be discovered amid the debris of this legendary history we see the god and the bayadere with a difference in the story of tawhaki and the divine girl tangotango one of the labours of hercules is traditionally preserved in the cleaning of the courtyard of rehua by the indefatigable rupe we know how classical tradition tells us that the milky way is but the stain from the fallen bowl when hebe lay a lapse of loveliness along the skies so here we find a certain kaitangata bleeding  and his blood running about over part of the heavens stained them and formed what we now call a ruddiness in the sky when therefore a red and ruddy tinge is seen in the heavens men say ah kaitangata stained the heavens with his blood if lesbos had its arion who rode the dolphin as skilfully as mr waterton did the cayman so does new zealand boast of its magician kae who stemmed the waves on the back of the gentlest of whales we may notice that in the distortion of stories which we believe ourselves to have more carefully preserved the parts and persons are often exchanged in our edition of hero and leander it was the lover who from before him put the parting waves and it was hy though window a sweet maiden sat grave with glad thoughts the antipodean minstrels tell the tale the other way and it is the fair girl hinemoa who dashes into the waves and crosses the boisterous strait as soon as her ear is struck by the soft measures from the horn of tutanekai hinemoa too has a way about her that strongly reminds us of that galatea whom dryden by the way has converted into a phyllis who pelted damaetas with apples and then hid herself among the willows with a strong desire of being found out  and hinemoa knew the voice that the sound of it was that of the beloved of her heart and she hid herself under the overhanging rocks of the hotspring but her hiding was hardly a real hiding but rather a bashful concealing of herself from tutanekai that he might not find her at once but only after trouble and careful searching for her so he went feeling about along the banks of the hotspring searching everywhere whilst she lay coyly hid under the ledges of the rock peeping out wondering when she would be found at last he caught hold of a hand and cried out hollo whos this  and hinemoa answered  its i tutanekai and he said but who are you whos i then she spoke louder and said  its i tis hinemoa and he said  ho  ho ho can such in very truth be the case  let us two go then to my house and she answered yes and she rose up in the water as beautiful as the wild white hawk and stepped upon the edge of the bath as graceful as the shy white crane and he threw garments over her and took her and they proceeded to his house ami reposed there and thenceforth according to the ancient laws of the maori they were man and wile anadyomene rising from the sea hardly looks more graceful than hinemoa the shy white crane upon the brink of the bath the galateas of the new zealand pastorals have it should be noticed their minerva to teach them the handiwork most useful to them thus kahukura learned the art of netting from the fairies but the pupil was not so proud as arachuc the dyers daughter of colopher who thought herself more nimble at the needle than the very goddess of the art there are no really comic legends among the traditionary stories of our new zealand brethren there is one piece of wit however at which they have never done laughing and they cannot hear it too often it consists of hearing a chief spoken of as being mistaken for a slave and asked to carry wood or perform other servile offices when this incident occurs then do they represent laughter holding both his sides their risibility at such an idea is inextinguishable diggory did not laugh half so willingly for twenty years at mr hardcastles daily story of old grouse in the gunroom as the new zealanders do at the bare and ticklish idea of a chief being asked to work or being spoken of as so employed the fact is as much out of the common order of things e with them as would be with us the sight of a prince consort posting bills in the strand or acting as conductor to an omnibus we conclude with a citation which will serve to 9how of what soft material and pleasant complexions fairies are composed in new zealand it is only necessary to premise that the hero and his friends had unconsciously intruded upon hallowed ground  te kanawa a chief of waikato was the man who fell in with a troop of fairies upon the top of pukemore a high hill in the waikato district this chief happened one day to go out to catch kiwis wih his dogs and when night came on he found himself right at the top of pukemore so his party made a tyre to give them light for it was very dark they had chosen a tree to sleep under a very large tree the only one tit for their purpose that they could timi  in fact it was a very convenient sleepingplace for the tree had immense routs sticking up high above the ground they slept beuveen these roots and made the fire beyond them as soon as it was dark they heard loud voices like the voices of people coming that way there were the voices of men ot

charpentier une gageure par victor cherbuliez hachette  co  the dukes daughter  is a story of english life and of very high life indeed since it tells of the duke of billingsgate head of the house of altamont and of his daughter lady jane lady jane falls in love with a man of inferior rankwealthy and a thorough gentleman but not up to the mark of what the duke thinks fitting for his only daughter there is another duke in the story and duchesses and lords and ladies and just a glimpse of a royal personage mrs oliphant rejoices in the portrayal of these exalted people  and it is needless to say that they are all instinct with life and verisimilitude being as remote from the colourless phantasms of the professedly fashionable novelist as they are from the crude monstrosities of the incompetent tyro in fiction since the death of anthony trollope we have had no one who could so faithfully and appreciatively depict in words the pompous overweening intractable duke who subject to the common and vulgar lot of humanity worships the fetish of his own extravagant pride even at the moment when it is shattered and pulverized the ruined duke has come to be a not uncommon personage in english fiction and his grace of billingsgate reminds the reader now and again of the central figure in  court eoyal but mrs oliphant has not elaborated the same features as mr baring gould selected for his especial study it is lady jane alta mont with whom her story is mainly concerned and the relations of father and daughter are drawn with a skilful hand in the fugitives there is a quieter though perhaps a more ingenious plot but the former of these novelettes is unquestionably the stronger i john vales guardian is in some respects the best novel mr christie murray has yet produced he has improved in style and shows a good deal of appreciation of the niceties of his craft his literary judgement and his power of applying it are now well matched and at the same time he has not lost in vigour his studies of boys and men in rural england are discriminating and lifelike and the french people he introduces among them are not too conventional if the latter part of the book were as good as the earlier part the whole would deserve very high praise but as it stands the unsatisfactoriness of the plot is sadly apparent stories which run over a good number of years are always comparatively difficult to manage and when the lapse of time is necessary only on account of the nature of the incidents and not for the development of character a story is apt to lose some effect and has to support the weight of a chronicle in john vales guardian  time is really not of the essence of the story  it does not increase the interest of the main study some event less probable than the discovery of a coal seam and less carefully traced out in its results would have served the authors purpose as well and would have intensified the interest mr besant has collected between one pair of covers five stories of varying length quality and intentionperhaps it ought to be added of varying merit  the holy hose is a tale of french emigres in england some ninety years ago and of selfsacrifice on the part of a chivalrous youth who devotes himself to death in the place of a rival the circumstances are not originally conceived nor very originally treated  but to say that the narrative is told freshly and with abundance of interest is only to say that the author has not fallen much below his standard in  the last mass mr besant goes back for his subject as far as the spanish armada and colours his story with a somewhat superfluous display of archaism  the inner house is a fantasy of science pitched in the year 189g when dr schwarzbaum announces in the theatre of the royal institution his great discovery of the prolongation of vital energy this is the cleverest if not the most interesting story of the collection the inversions of thought and desire which take hold of the inhabitants of the house of life are cunningly imagined and well sustained there is abundance of interest in mr besants book which contains as much reading and certainly as much romance as any threevolume novel miss gerard generally writes well and gracefully frequently in a deeper and more thoughtful vein and may always be relied on to please a number of readers and this in spite of a something which for lack of a better word we may call a suspicionno moreof the amateur this slight flaw is apparent once or twice in lady baby which delightful as it is would not we think be the worse for a very little judicious cutting one feels that something may possibly have been thrown in against the authors better judgment to swell the volumes to the conventional number this were a pity especially in novels of so pretty and delicate a style as miss gerardsa style too more easily lost than found lady baby is interesting enough as a heroine and her people and surroundings are well and skilfully drawn yet the reader may be inclined to think that maud epperton who is quite of another kidney would have filled the part of heroine as well or better on maud hangs much of the interest of the story she has a good deal of uncertainty in her composition which is in itself piquant also potentialities of other sorts than the artistic possibilities which are so constantly recurring in sir peters conversation the loss of lady babys fortune and the events that spring from it are a little spun out and also a little confused on the whole however the book is singularly pleasant and to a certain extent lifelike  claire brandon  is a curious and unaccountable piece of work the first few chapters are perfectly rationalan epithet which becomes steadily more inapplicable as the story progresses they also contain lifelike and humorous touches all traces of which are doomed to a speedy disappearance the readers interest and attention are no sooner aroused than he is abandoned to a series of emotional whirlwinds the causes of which are often mysterious and generally out of all proportion to the violence of their expression conversations or soliloquies become paroxysms of brief utterance or even single words all separated from one another by dotted lines but continuing for successive pages a system which soon ceases to be either instructive or amusing the writer then appears to grow breathless which is scarcely surprising and proceeds to relate his story in gasps at any rate this is the effect produced by an endless series of short clauses each placed in a separate line

overwhelming remorse for proceedings which appear to the ordinary mind not only legitimate but necessary and will probably hope to the end that he may have had a hand in his dead brothers servants opportune disappearance or murder he certainly ought to have had to account for his extreme discomfort but if any questions are to be asked a final one arises regarding over twothirds of the whole book which would prove fatal to its existence the readers first thought on getting to the end of  a heavy reckoning is alls well that ends well but on second thoughts he will feel doubtful whether all can be said to end well when two of the principal cha racters among the dramatis personce of the story have to meet with a terrible and tragic fate in order to tit in with the requirements of the general afhuities and natural selections which form the basis of the story in any case e werners latest romance is an able and vigorous work written with force power of imagination and a good command of language the characters are drawn with a firm hand and possess a marked individuality the plot is perhaps a little too intricate as is apt to be the case with german novels and the reader becomes a little confused amid the many crosspurposes and loves and hatreds still they hold his attention and the courageous denotement deserves laudation a large part of the interest of the work however is derived not so much from the characters as from the gigantic conflict which the practical science of our day must wage when with steam and iron it invades the regions which once belonged to the chamois the eagle and the alpine hunter the book appears to refer to the construction of some of those mighty railroads that now penetrate the alps in all directions and have destroyed their barrier

disagreeable and painful side of life  a daughters sacrifice would clinch the matter the  cold hard world as presented by them is very cold and hard indeed with the truth of the aspect in moderation we are not inclined to quarrel but when it comes to pushiog it beyond measure the result is not only depressing but inartistic the material and main facts of the story are in themselves unpleasant and some things that happen are natural enough yet seem withal and in the telling inhuman and cold  blooded the authors have spared neither their creatures nor the reader one iota whenever an unpleasant effect was obtainable they straightway seem to have gone for it with unflinching zest another grievance is there being absolutely no one to likenot perhaps an uncommon experience with readers of mr philipas clever and exciting novels this one certainly contains strong and dramatic situations and admitting the natures and conditions of those concerned some of these situations are not only possible but probable not to say inevitable but the picture is so hard unsympathetic and matter of fact and at the same time so startling exaggerated and wanting in all relief that it is more disagreeable than harrowing just where it should succeed it fails and palls where it should rouse surely too there is less quickness and sparkle about it than one might fairly expect and too much brusquerie in some episodes of the drama the career of one helen de teales is the point of interest she has from first to last nor rest nor pause yet even in the overwhelming moment when she is betrayed and unmasked to her son and his lifelong respect and affection fall for ever at the blow it is not so much sympathy one is conscious of as a shrinking distaste and repugnance we may mention in passing that however much of a rascal the black mailer her persecutor may beand no rascality seems beyond himthe mere vulgarity of the man is more unaccountable and he is not the only offender in this respect if anything in the way of a moral is intended it is the insistence on the utter and absolute hopelessness for a woman of recovering a lost place in society or indeed for the matter of that anywhere else and though cruel kindness it is to her children to attempt to bring them up in a  respectable environment at all but if anything this rather cuts the other wayso one might opine at least the author of  dick chichester  is consciously or unconsciously a disciple of the school of anthony trollope fernlandshire as depicted by mr or miss  or mrs roachwe are entirely in the dark as

a very pleasant though somewhat placid story has been evolved the presence of but one villain would have lent animation to the plot for as it stands the only obstacles in though way of the happiness of the principal characters are put there by themselves the author is great on church and state and has evidently a profound veneration for lord beaconsfield but there can be no question of the genial and wholesome optimism which pervades the book murder should have been the title of m zolas new book in the first fiftysix pages we find preparations going on for no fewer than three brutal assassinations two by the knife and one by poison committed for three different reasons by three distinct sets of persons of the four chief characters in the book one commits a horrible murder for which he goes unpunished but long afterwards is sent to penal servitude for life for the murder of his wife of which he is innocent the wife who has originally helped him in the firstnamed murder is afterwards stabbed to death by her lover the young hero of the novel also commits a terrible throatcutting of the same kind and lets two other men who are innocent of the crime go to lifelong hard labour for it he is afterwards murdered himself the fourth and last leading person in the plot a beautiful girl deliberately wrecks an express train causing the loss of fifteen lives and then kills herself at the end of the work it may be said that all the characters in the book have been murdered except two and that these two are left in prison without any hope of ever coming out and that for a crime which they did not commit what we have described is not art and is not nature it is not true to life to describe a society found haphazard in the administration of one of the greatest railway companies in the world and including directors stationmasters assistant stationmasters guards and drivers and their families in which there is no good woman and only one good man who is introduced apparently as a foil to the others who is a labourer finding temporary employment upon the line and who himself has done several years imprisonment for manslaughter yet in spite of all that we have said there is art in the volume although not in its main features the study of the railway systemthe descriptions of the stations trains of railway glories and of railway horrorsis greater than a study by balzac and its perfection only increases the regret we feel at the manner in which m zola plays with talents so considerable the author of the literary  chestnut  or joe miller i prefer

B3500,"['8776630', '6760511']",  tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he affects to adopt the opinions of duchinski about the great russian race he looks for the sources of his tales in any other direction at least two of the pieces given by miss hodgetts are russian bilini or legendary ballads the last of the russian warriors  and the celebrated chant of ilya muromets whose name is somewhat disguised in the form which it assumes in her book this ulina is interesting as giving us a glimpse how vladimir the first christian sovereign presented himself to the popular imagination in russia strange to say we find next to nothing about him in his religious character if we except his contest with the idolater ilya is the most popular hero of the old yolksepos vladimir is holding high court at sacred kiev  elie ilya galloped straight into the princes

observed that the wine is green the favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious

they were not improbable thecharacters had very decided human weaknesses but they wvere not put forward in an offensive light but rather toned down to meet possible prejudices many objected to certain incidents being incorporated into the story the elopement of the doctors wife through jealousy was not a pleasant subject but the incident is not an uncommon one in ordinary life and it was carefully handled the concluding incidents were the most faulty in the story the return of the first wife in disguise to find another in her place and to be compelled to conceal her identity was rather an awkward conception which although it was got rid of by her speedy death left a most uncomfortable conclusion to the story it had been well for mrs henry woods reputation if she had tried to improve

a pleasure in the exercise of any power of whose possession we are conscious that nothing claims more continual selfwatchfulness on the part of the novelist than the propensity unduly to indulge his peculiar talent at the expense of that variety which he who assumes to depict the world as it is never should lose sight of mrs grey has fallen into this common error she knows where her strength lies and she constructs all her plots so as to afford the most ample oppor tunities for its exercise  she fills her fictions with scenes of sor row  she is impatient of the smiling pictures which neverthe less are necessary for the introduction of her sombre ones she glides over them with speed and almost with carelessness until she arrives at the pathetic part of her story then she rejoices in her conscious power  her eyes brighten  thoughts throng thick and fast her pen traces them in bold characters she analyses the feelings lays bare every anguished nerve and to use an expressive term piles up the agony  with a skill that rarely fails to move the hardest heart and draw tears from the manliest eye admirably as this is done it is a fault that there is too much of it not only are all her novels of the sombre hue but there is more of painful picturing in each than can be approved by a critical judgment we admit the beauty of a great deal of this painting the exciting interest of the scenes the ability with which they are constructed and the eloquencewithwhich they are described  but there is alimit to the claims of the novelist upon our feelingstouch them but do not harrow them it must be remembered that it is onliv ideal sorrows with which we love to sympathize the sight of real suffering gives us pain nul the skill of the novelist is shown in conducting the reader to the point where the ideal may be excited to the ntmost stretch of emotion without tres l passing upon the realms of the real and producing pain or upon the cloudland of the unnaitural and toppling down the whole fabric fancy had reared airs glay certainly errs in stretching emotion too far and converting a  pleasing pain into a veritable anguish  and the impression whichi her novels leave behind them is that with which we remember somne terrible sorrow it has been our fate to witness in real life the fault for such it is may be readily amended for it grows out of her very excellence and we name it because it would be pity that so much real genius should not seek to be as perfect ai possible the gamblers w fife exhibits this fault together with all the excellences of its predecessors it

confidently commend it to the circulating library and its patrons i i i i i i i i  the bankers wife whiativer the juliets of the literary world may say or think there is much  in a namemuch both of ill and of good and if the work we are now called upon to notice had happened to have made its appearance anonymously it would lhave offered a notable proof of both branches of the proposition mrs

narrative fiction and will thus far prove the good of a name but had it been published anonymously though it might have linkered for a few short weeks on the shelves of the circulating libraries it would after a brief period have started into that sudden fame and popularity with all classes of readers from the most thoughtless to the most thinking which now it will be long in reaching even if it attain them at all the name of its writer first as that of a woman and secondly as that of a popular  novelist will long keep it out of the hands of those  grave and reverend signors who are the chief dispensers of that reputation which they cannot compass for themselves and who till they allow mrs gore to convince them of the fact by such books as the bankers wife will never be satisfied that a woman has been gifted with faculties of observing and setting forth the features of our common nature for the mingled delight and benefit of all for which they may look in vain among their own lordly sex the truth is that the bankers wife should have been written by a man or it should have been left possible by an anonymous titlepage to suppose it so written it would then have passed for the most masterly and instructive exposition that  ever put on paper of that lucrelust which is the most fatal and besetting vice of high civilization and which half neutralises all the virtues of that conditionits aarons rod which however swallows up all the other vices of our time only to disgorge them again in a more loathsome form than they possessed before of this  monster vice of our daythe vilest in its origin yet the most vast and all pervading in its effects mrs gore has here drawn a picture more moving and impressive to the moral sense than the loftiest fiction of old romance or the most soulsubduing dream of modern  sentiment  yet more true to the damning facts that daily beset the hearths and homes of every one of us than the most dry of ancient  chronicles or the most popular of  histories let not the mere novelreader feel alarmed by this opening glance at the new production of his favourite writer its  gaieties are at the least as light as sparkling and as profuse as its  gravities are weighty sterling and stamped with the impresses of moral and social truth if  the bankers wife is perhaps the most valuable and im portant contribution its accomplished author has yet made to that inestimable portion of our contemporary literature which aims at making its readers happier by making them wiser and better it is certainly inferior to none among the brilliant company of its predecessors in those inexhaustible powers of entertainment in which this remarkable writer yields to none of her living rivals and to a very few dead ones  the bankers wife is as we have intimated at the outset of our remarks notably a tale of the present dayof the actual day and hour in which we live and its second title of  court and city bespeaks the wide range taken by its scenes and characters in this respect none of mrs gores novels a ppeal to the tastes and associations of a more numerous body of readers besides the banker hamlyn the hero of the storywho wavers between

B7384,['8725978'],  seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the

pathan ruler of the district whose story is well and touchingly told another story the  legend of the rajah chand sa and of the hundred headless horsemen is a good specimen of the still flourishing

early part of last century made use of in fiction we had not found the material particularly stimulating reading  the sheep  stealers depends on the turnpike troubles it is true yet is partly independent of them they are used incidentally and not at all ineffectively the book itself may not be remarkable for the spirit of beauty or style but it is remarkable for its power of lengthened presentation united with strength and firmness of handling this judgement applies to the scenery as well as to the figures that animate it indeed eachlandscape and people  is a fitting compliment of the other  the sheepstealers appears to be a first book and there is a womans name on the titlepage in some ways though not perhaps in all it suggests experience and does not suggest a feminine outlook or manner we should judge that it is written from a very full and comprehensive knowledge of the people and district the very heart of the place and the habits of the countryside at the present time are so well known to the writer that there can have been little difficulty in putting the clock back some decades the valley of the wye and the hills of hereford on the borders of england and wales partake of whatever belongs distinctively to both countries most of the characters are rustic but the local speech is merely cleverly suggested not tediously insisted on some of these country people are drawn with extreme clearness and an essential reality and sobriety of touch rhys walters the hero of the tale is partly an exception for though the reverse of uninteresting the strands of his nature are less clearly apprehended and less well controlled by his creator he represents the tragic side of the story and there is no humour in the treatment of him there is on the other hand a good deal of humour in some of the other people particularly in the pig driver we have seldom seen a figure at once so sinister and so laughable as his there is also clever portraiture in the mistress of the farm at great masterhouse and in her maid the authors own personality and sympathies are carefully excluded sheepstealing is a more exciting theme than the rebecca risings and it

in the earlier half of the nineteenth century and with the riots that spread over south wales after the passing of a new highway act under which tolls were increased and the compounding of tolls on easy terms which had formerly been the custom was done away with the main incident is excellently handled the moving power of tragedy issues through a plain and simple statement of events there are no side appeals to the readers sympathy thc sheepstealcrs is tue most unemotional novel we have read for many months without passion without bias without any personal or sentimental undercurrents whatsoever rhys the hero is a perfectly ordinary type of human being without the fatal night of the riot  and he joined the expedition as being  more a piece of outoftheway amusement to him than anything affecting his opinionshe would probably have lived a comfortable farmers life to the end of his days but he made one mistake and luck was against him when making it in the fighting a man was killed and the rest of rhys life while he endured it was passed in concealment and in the clutches of an iniquitous old sheepstealer miss jacobs women are the least successful part of her work in spite of painstaking analysis there is a certain obtuseness to femininity and a more delicate and instructive comprehension will be necessary before her female characters carry the easy conviction ol

B5919,['8720648'],  the new republic or culture faith and philosophy in an english country house 2 vols chatto fc windus for more than half of the present century english society and english letters had the advantage of being reflected in a series of halffictitious halfsatirical writings to which hardly any previous parallel can be found from the days of stagecoaches to those of telegraphs from the time when the english gentleman devoted himself to madeira and barouche driving to that in which he took to laborious reading for honours and equally laborious lecturing on things in general these books extended they were written by a man of extensive scholarship of much knowledge of the world and of sufficiently clear and definite tastes to give him a position from which to look ont and to criticize they constantly introduced wellknown personageb and always wellknown ideas and hobbies both the personages and the ideas were frequently caricatured but the caricature was alway so artistically done that it was of more value than the dull fidelity of any number of photographs it was difficult sometimes to recognise coleridge in mr flosky and mr mystic scythrop and shelley were not always identifiable and mr feathernest was clearly a libel on southey but there was no mere parody and no mere misrepresention and these stories from  headlong hall to  gryll orange have therefore never lacked readers and admirers though there have sometimes been brisk young men of letters who have fondly imagined that they had  discovered  peacock this digressive beginning is pardonable because it is absolutely certain that no one will read the new republic without having  crotchet castle and the rest constantly in his mind and because the merits we have noticed in peacocks books are those the want of which will be chiefly felt in the author before us he has imagined we give the scheme of the book because it is not reprinted verbatim from the magazine in which it first appeared a saturday to monday party of londoners guested in a seaside villa which their host otho lawrence has inherited from a rich and intellectual but improper uncle the story if story there be goes no further and the contents of the book are expanded to two volumes first by the device not altogether copyright of having subjects for conversation written on the menu of the saturdays dinner and secondly by the institution of a sunday debating club to cany out the ideas thus started and to frame an utopia in the good old platonic fashion these conversations and debates fill np the whole space with the exception of a few pieces of description after the manner of a nineteenth century  minute philosopher all the interest centres in the characters who are no strangers there is mr herbert who has strikingly original ideas on art and ideas still more strikingly original on ethics and political economy mr luke who is equally enamoured of culture of conduct and of his own very peculiar ideas of christianity mr rose whose sentences are of a marvellous modulation and in whose mouth the name of botticelli is no stranger mr storks whom the physical basis of life knows mr stockton who has both spoken and heard of  the infinite azure and the rev dr jenkinson who has silvery hair is great upon plato and does not at all like to have it supposed that he is not equally great upon the new testament of less notorious personages or of personages with no notoriety at all there are several of whom the most prominent besides the host a wellmeaning but feeble young man who would like to have a mission if he knew how and lord allen a variety of the same species are mr saunders a very disagreeable youth in pink stockings with a profound disbelief in everything but himself and mr j s mill and mrs sinclair a poetess who combines an ethereal aspect with some vulgarity the conversations turn first on no less alarming a subject than the aim of life and the subsequentlyfounded utopia is intended to give expression on each speakers part to this ailsa in the pragma of the disxjurae the accuracy of parody it simply aatoniwhing there is probably not one educated reader in a hundred who on reading most of mr herberts speeches will not rack his brains to remember in whioh of certain wellknown and now not easily procurable volumes they occur the sermon which practically doses the book might very well have found a home between the drab covers which issue monthly from a certain kentish village  and a speech of mr roses at vol il p 179 really sets one wondering whether ones own copy of some studies on strongly ribbed paper which appeared four years ago is imperfect or not this is all very well but it does not need demonstration that the parodist element is one which bhould be kept to its place and that that place is a minor one a parody in two volumes is something of a monstrosity and one certainly tyres of such a pro longed concert with all parts sustained only by the mockingbird nor is this the only charge which must be brought against the book there are some touches in one character wbich cannot but be regarded as the gravest possible offences against good taste good manners and fair play it would be a repetition of the offence to particularise them here  and they are unfortunately not likely to escape the notice or it may be hoped the censure of any instructed reader a worse fault perhaps artistically though an infinitely more venial one in every other way is the absence of a foil to all taheee intellectual personages there is indeed a certain lady ambrose who is intended we suppose to supply this want but as she is a mere woman of the world with almost all the usual defects and less than the usual brains of the character the contrast is too glaring to be good or satisfactory we want to recur to peacock a dr opimian or a lady clorinda to give us a milieu of sense not wholly divorced from intellect the book is so clever a book despite its faults that it deserves criticism of the admonitory rather than the objurgatory kind we should have to go far before we found such a brilliant putting into words of the famous butlerian maxim as this conscience in most souls is like an english sovereign it reigns but it does not govern or such neat phrases ns the following  m a cynic is a kind of inverted confessor perktually niaking enemies for the sake of what he lows to be false  life is the preface to eternity  unfortunately it is a preface that we cannot skip and the dedication is generally made to the wrong person  the whole teachings of that school have always seemed to me nothing more than a few fragments of science imperfectly understood obscured by a few fragments of christianity imperfectly remembered  you forget

this side of the atlantic as well as in his own country if  the europeans does not prove him to have as much skill in writing novels aa in writing essays it leaves the question open though spun out in the english edition into two volumes the europeans  might very well have been printed in one and it is altogether too light in its workmanship to be classed among regular novels superior as it is to most of them it is in fact a daintilywritten aud wellconstructed prose comedy containing very few incidents and some of these being rather preposterous but on the whole giving a lively  sketch as he very fitly calls it of one phase of life and one aspect of character in new england the story is of an enterprising lady the daughter of american parents but born and bred in europe morgauatically married to a jetty german prince whose family is now anxious to divorce him from her amicably and of the adventures that follow from her efforts to fall in with these proposals if she can make it convenient to do so she bears the title of baroness munster and has persuaded her brother a goodnatured bohemian whose name is plain felix young and who has no other occupation than that of a strolling artist and an amiable pleasure seeker in general to go with her from her german home on a visit to their unknown kinsfolk who live somewhere near boston there we meet them in the first chapter and in the chapters that follow we arc entertained with the small confusions and complications occasioned by the arrival of these harmless bohemians in ti new england arcadia whose inmates for some time do not know what to make of them thc head of the family ibo strangers uncle is a mr wentworth a wealthy man and in every way as good as his own gold but so oppressed with the solemnity of life and its duties as to find no room for pleasure in his scheme of existence though at the same time an excellent and indulgent father to his son clifford and his daughters charlotte and gertrude

s comfort and anxious for everybodys happiness anet so unselfish that she does not know she is in love with mr brand the prim young unitarian minister whom sho is anxious to marry to her sister because she thinks the match would bc to her sisters spiritual welfaro and would be a very agreeable arrangement for mr brand himself gertrude wentworth is more visionary and something of an anomaly in this puritan family felix young comes as a revelation to her from the gay outside world about which she has been dreaming all her life and soon persuades her that ho is much more likely than mr brand to make her happy  there must be a thousand different ways of being dreary she says in one of her pretty naive flirtations with felix and sometimes i thinkwe make use of them all  i am trying for once to be natural she says at another time when mr brand is expostulating with her for her innocent levity  i have been pretending all my life why shouldnt i be frivolous if i want  one has a right to be frivolous if its ones nature no i dont care for great questions i care for pleasurefor amusement here is a bit of the last chapter in which the family is discussing whether gertrude shall be allowed to marry felix   havent you confidence in felix gertrude was frowning thero was something about her that her father and charlotte had never seen before charlotte got up and came to her as if to put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid to touch her mr wontworth however was not afraid  i have had moro confidence in felix than in you he said yes you have never had confidence in menever never i dont know why  oh sister sister murmured charlotte you have always needed advice mr wentworth declared you have had a difficult temperament 11 why do you call it difficult it might have been easy if you had allowed it you wouldnt let mo bo natural i dont know what you wanted to make of me       i havo nover seen you so passionate obsorvod mr wentworth with an air of indignation mitigated by high principles  i am sorry if i offend you said gertrude  you offend me but i dont think you are sorry  yes father she is sorry said charlotte i would even go further dear uncle felix interposed i would question whethor she really offends you how can she offend you  to this mr wontworth made no immediate answer then in a moment  she has not profited as wo hoped gertrude was very palo sho stood looking down i have told felix i would go away with him she presently said  go away sister asked charlotte awayaway to some strange country towhat do you call it turning an instant to felix  to bohemia  do you proposo to dispense with preliminaries asked mr wentworth getting up gertrude turned to hor father i tm re profited she said you wanted to form my character well my character is formedfor my age i know what i want i havo chosen i am determined to marry this gentleman what little romance there is in  the europeans  gathers round the baroness and a certain mr acton  but we will not weaken the interest of the story to its readers by detailing this especially as the real merit of the book lies chiefly in its descriptions of gertrude and felix and the matters immediately concerning them these descriptions are fresh delicate and artistic to english readers the europeans will be particularly attractive because of the graceful picture mr janies draws of a condition of society hardly possible in this country and perhaps the kindly satire with which he touches up the picture will be as intelligible to them as to the americans who know the realities of nineteenth century puritanism in its pleasantest aspects in the out of the wray suburbs of boston we may hope great things of mr james when he tries his hand at a more elaborate novel,dom

thing new that all his clothes be worn out torn or patched nothing bringing more scandal on the profession than begging in good clothes be it however well understood that if in the exercise of his

seventeen years old virtuous beautiful and of equal rank the relations of this charming girl brought her up with so much care that they would not allow her to make any connexion by which her virtue might be at all endangered she was hardly ever suffered even to approach her latticed window lest some misfortune should be the consequence as no one could gaze upon her extreme beauty with impunity either her father or her mother or her brother valerio attended her every where and watched her every action some months ago dorido having accidently obtained a sight of her became violently enamoured  but could declare his love by no other means than by casting empassioned glances towards the window of her chamber when she happened to be there as he passed by the house if the homage of his eves was not always remarked by the object of it at least it was sometimes noticed  at all events it was practised often enough to produce the wishedfor effect  clorinia at first was satisfied with looking at the cavalier without being seen but soon she felt a wish that he should see her also without knowing why she wished it and answering by little and little to his amorous looks she at last conceived a passion in the same way in which she had inspired it i mean by appearing at her lattice dorido soon guessed that he had made on her all the impression he desired and since he was denied more indulged himself in the transports of believing himself beloved nevertheless lie sought to reap a more solid satisfaction from his conquest lie contrived to form an acquaintance with valerio and succeeded so well as to attach him in such a degree that they were inseparable a valerio could no longer live without his friend dorido they were always together sometimes at one house sometimes at another this gave iorido an opportunity of sometimes seeing his charmer aid even speakingg to her but never alone thie eves of the lovers alone communicated to each other the secrets of their hearts this state of affairs however did not last for ever clorinia mdle her maid scintila the confidant of her passion  this old woman wlho had wit and wished to serve her mistress called uipon dorido and having met with him  noble cavaliet said she  you need not attempt to disguise the truth from me i know tile state of your heart you love clorinia and i am niuch mistaken if your love is not returned you are both dying with impatience for an interview and i cannot see your situation without pity i shall never rest till i have procured you the satisfaction you both so ardently desire the lover transported with joy at these words thanked the dtuenna for her good will assuring her that she should not find him ungrateftul if she succeeded then making use of so excellent an opportunity he wrote a very passionate billet which he conjured her to convey to the amiable sister of valerio scintila returned immediately to her mistress to acquaint her with the step she had taken and presented her with loridos letter clorinia blamed her for taking charge of itbut soon forgave her nothing was now thought of but how to manage the interview with the lovers the lady raised so many difficulties that she would have relinquished it altogether if the old woman who was more ingenious had not hit upon a plan they both approved of scintilas ledelhamber was on the ground floor and adjoining to her room there was another which was filled with old and useless furniture this room was lighted only by a small window defended by two strong bars of iron through which there was only room sufficient for a hand to pass this window which was about five or six feet from the ground looked into a lane or blind alley quite uninhabited and the place appeared exactly suited to lovers who were satisfied to limit their happines to conversation only the old woman as soon as she saw her young mistress disposed to speak with jorido through this little window hastened to inform the cavalier who on the ensuing night at eleven oclock placed himself at a convenient spot lie approached the bars where he found scintila expecting him she requested him to wait patiently until the servants were gone to bed lie did not languish long in suspense the wishedfor moment soon arrived clorinia came trembling to the window at which her lover presented himself in speechless agitation as they both now loved for the first time they were agitated at the sight of each other and the excess of their feelings at first prevented them from speaking but love has more than one language the lady passed one of her beautiful hands between the bars of the window and the lover clasping it with ardour covered it with a thousand kisses at last by degrees they broke silence and indulged in passionate protestations of eternal love their souls were so entirely occupied by the pleasure of seeing each other that they would have suffered daylight to find them together if the old woman had not interrupted their conversation to warn them that it was time to seplarate before he would retire dorido entreated his mistress to allow him to return the next night at the same hour to the window and the lady could not resolve to refuse him this favour at last they separated equally delighted with the conversation they had just had with each other and filled with impatience for another interview lorido especially was too much agitated to be able to take any rest or to speak more correctly he was miserable until the time of his reiurn to the window you may easily suppose he did not fail to be punctual his mistress finding no obstacle to her design appeared again at the same place and their meeting was the second time less embarrassed by timidity than the first the cavalier who had a great deal of wit said a tliouialtld fine things to his mistress who replied to them in as lively a manner this conversation lasted for three hours and tfleir discourse was mingled with innocent caresses  so that the second interview pleased them both as much as the first che prudent scintila was again obliged to separate them again and again they accused her of cruelty not reflecting that though she disturbed their pleasures it was only with a view to render them more lasting for in fact they continued to enjoy their stolen interviews with so much secrecy and good management that not a soul livjiugt knew of them but the old woman and one other person t this other person was a young man of rank namded horatio a native of this city lie also loved clorinia having by chance seen her at her lattice and had revealed his love to her by signs  but finding them very badly received he concluded that he had a rival wsho was mole happy and judged that rival to he lorido as he was united in so strict a friendship with valerio to clear upi his wellfounded suspicions he sought out dorido who was one of his friends to vwhom lie spoke in these words  aly dear dorido i am come to ask a favour of yno and i conjure you not to refuse me my happiness depends upon it you are cointinually with valerio  you very often visit at his house aid i cannot help thinking that vou ale in love with his sister  if i ami mistaken in my conjectures oblige me by declaring it y ou are too well deserving the heart of that lady for me to venture to dispute it with you  you love clorinia then exclaimed iorido a little ruffled i i confess that i am quite charmed with her replied ihoratio  but nevertheless i do you justice and agree that you dese rve letter than i can the happiness of being her husband  lhet us speak without flatterv interrupted dorido  i should doubtless consider myself highly honoured in hecoiningr the husband of clorinia but  frankly eonfess to you that i have no designi to marry her  is it possible cried horatio eagerly  that you do not mean to mnarry her all i my friend how different are my intentions from yours aly highest ambition is to unite my fate with hers  your views should yield to mine  sacrifice the mad hopes you have conceived i expect this effort from your friendship and your virtue  you might add said dorido  that i owe it to the family of lorinia yes continued lie  i will leave the field open to you and if valerios sister should accept your addresses and consent to give you her hand i will cease to be your rival i vill do more i will speak in your favour and i assure you that in that case it shall not be my fault if your wishes are not fulfilled horatio was so well satisfied w ith this speech that he testified his gratitude to iorido without thinking that his promise ivas only conditional and therefore that he ought to mistrust it lie made no reflection of this kind but even requested dorido to use his good offices in his behalf with clorinia dorido could not but be touched at the frankness of horatio and being generosl ellough to prefer the huippiness of his friend to his own inclinations as his views were purer he resolved to do all in his power to wean his affections from this lady in fact the very next time he saw her he addressed her thus  you are not ignorant madam that horatio is added to the ntinber of your slaves lut i am doubtful whether you know how truly he adores you learn then that he thinks only of you and that to receive your hand is the only wish of his heart  i am chairmed to hear it replied clorinia  my reception of him shall convince you how little i wish for any lover but dorido   well know replied the cavalier  the value of a preference so glorious for me but i should think that i abused your goodness if i wvas not capable of some selfdenial  horatio has inany good qualities and when you know him better you will not be srrv perhaps if your friends should second ils wishes  how l cried the lady  to hear you is enough to make me believe that you wish to make me miserable is it possible that you can wish me to reply to the tenderness of horatio i i never answered dorido   i have no such thought i only wished to convince you that if you feel any inclination for lloratio and your friends approve of his addresses my heart would in vain rebel  that i would sacrifice mnselfto the happiness of my rival to show you how entirely devoted i am to all your vishes  i fear replied she  that the victim would be as submissive as you represent him and that your love for me is not quite so sincere as you profess it to be but continued she  i do not pretend to put you to the trial dorido shall be my first lover and my last upon this assurance you may rely let horatio persevere as much as he pleases in his love for me he will never be more successful i will confess to you that i was acquainted with his passion which i learned from his gestures before my window and have been so little pleased lb it that i have conceived a dislike for him which almost borders on hatred  after these words iorido did not dare to mention hioratio again as he perceived very plainly that the topic was extremely disagreeable to clorinia lie changed the conversation for the rest of the time they were together and the night was passed in mutual lrotestations of eternal love on the next day dorido received a visit from horatio i well my friend said the latter i have you seen clorinia  did any thing fall from her lovely lips which could be interpreted in my favour  i am very sorry replied the other  that i cannot give you a very flattering account you have but little room for hope 1 extollrd your merit i pointed out the splendour of the alliance i represented you as much more in love with her than perhaps you really are  but the cruel beauty silenced me by declaring that she could not reply to your love and that the soft bonds of ilymen should never unite her fate with yours at these words lioratio turned pale and fell into a profound reverie  while uorido symathising in hlis grief like a true friend pointed out to him that he ought to reliiiilnih his pretensions rather than attempt to constrain the incli nations of clorinta and that there were in room many other ladies equally amiable who would do more justice to his merit  to conclude my dear horatio added he  i am sure i have given you no cause to be dissatisfied with me i would willingly have yielded the sister of alerio to you provided she had been at all inclined to fiavour your passion i would have made this sacrifice to friendship can you now refuse to abandon a conquest that you are by no means sure to gain  horatio theit broke silence and replied to his friend far from reproacling you i must consider myself under a great obligation to you tor the service you have fruitlessly attempted to render ine in pleading my cause i confess that it is more reasonable i should renolunce mily pretensions to a hand which 1 am not alble to obtain than that you should relinquish a heart which you already ossess0 farewell iny triend i will spare no ains to enable me to profit by your advice and formi an

shall i have sacrificed horatio to your ashes than i also will join you in eternal darkness oh i that it were permitted to thee to see and rejoice in the just vengeance whichi will intlict on the wretch who has dared to deprive thee of thy innocent hand thuiis did iorido bewail his mistresss fate until daybreak when lie repaired to her house where every one was in the greatest distress and agitation valerio and his father seemed to be doubly afflicted at the sight of him and they embraced each other almost drowned in tears  oh dorido my son said ihe old man  my daughter is at the point of death having lost so great a quantity of blood as alone would be sufficient to terminate her existence was there ever so unfortunate a father who can have been capable of committiug so horrible an act  what punishment can console us under our present affliction  sir answered dorido  suspend we our lamentations for a while and let us think of one thing only which concerns us all the author of this misery must perish i will inflict on him an adequate punishment but before i execute a revenge on him which shall astonish and horrify posterity i must make myself what i now am not receive me therefore for your soninlaw it will be more for the konotir of us all that it should be said that clorinia was avenged by her husband than by her fathers friend  both fattier and son accepted doridos

veritable sayings and doings of the world it is a transcript and somewhat too literal an one the author has seized wvith singular felicity the commonplaces of society and set them down faithfully but lhe has not taken the novelists license and invested them with those delicate hues of poetrv which are necessary to lignify them to our fancies and to give them an interest that of themselves they do not commnanl hence it is not imlrolable that some fastidious realers may exclaim against the familiarity of many of the lialogues and object to the expressions lut into the inouths of the speakers as occasionally coarse and vulgar the answer of mr ii ril es wvould be that they are the very language of such personages as lie has introduced  that thley are true to cliaracter that such men always so converse in society thus far this defence is valid  to what extent an author is bound to dress up his lialogucs in a shape lifferent from that which they vwould have worn in fact whether it is

B2569,['8899213'],  i the caravaner8 by the author of  eliza i beth and her german garden smith elder  co the belief that women cannot  draw  men will have to be modified if elizabeth continues her merciless ironical studies of their weakness she has a splendid scorn for the crasser type of male and the cruder ruder sort of husband it is not the least of elizabeths many gifts that she always seems to choose with unerring instinct the background best suited to display her talents the humorous and sometimes farcical incidents of a caravan tour in england give her innumerable opportunities of revealing the character of a german husband and the gradual revolt of his oppressed but charming spouse like all books that elizabeth writes this is one in which the reviewer instinctively marks for quotation passages of happy humour and delightful comedy if the humour is occasionally too farcical the characterdrawing is always shrewd and penetrating,dom
