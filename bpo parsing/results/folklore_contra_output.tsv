B6865,"['6721267', '8736364']",  literature more leaves from the journal of a life in the highlands from 1862 to 1882 smith elder  co it is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be the twenty years with which the journal has to do was indeed an eventful period it was marked by such important incidents as thc francogerman and russoturkish wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves but with these matters the journal is altogether unconcerned it deals solely with the queens life in the highlands and though it is quite natural that her majestys subjects should wish to know what were the queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it it records no thrilling adventures a carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the journal offers to its readers the interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective we look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her as a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray though selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect an art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic and the special value of the queens journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour in these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects it is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the queen is so fond of scotland this book answers the question it is because there and especially in the highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity the queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of though house of stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors heredity asserts itself mr galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone for we arc insensibly reminded of king george iii farmer george when wo read the queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping but although the journal recounts the queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied but we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern the book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author charles j robinson  more leaves from the journal of a life in  0f the highlands from 1862 to 1882 btf literature  tn smith i crq elder  co   j th from a purely literary point of view there  he is not a great deal to say of the queens new j th hook its style is of the simplest and it al has the charm of naturalness which belongs  al to simplicity the story is told without effort  w or affectation of any kind and produces its j tc effect entirely by though force of sincerity her  q majesty is probably a sympathetic rather  s than an acute and dispassionate observer  a1 and everything that she sees is seen through  o sentiment that the sentiment itself is tl always pure and often elevated is a reason i why these records of home life in the royal c circle will find a responsive echo otherwise o the experiences recorded are not altogether 1 such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character t the book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen it affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare but it is e its simple human interest that gives the  hook its strongest appeal the reader rises  from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learned something more of the good  i woman by whom it was writtenthat above all else he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be born by all to whom it comes how will the queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of st pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the queens consort had died at windsor this book contains the answer to that question its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope of the queens personal character the volume contains naturally enough many indications that character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will it was so in those early days of her sovereignty when lord melbourne told the queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could eve happily i for long without a mans arintb rest on and when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero this womanly trait is obviously a key to the queens intimacy with dr norman macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered though tribute of an i abundant gratitude a keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that principal campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of though statue of the prince consort at aberdeen when it rained in torrents in other places the manifest sincerity saves everything the book contains some few indications of the queens taste in literature we gather that she is a warm lover of scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the duchess of saxecoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell scotts stories  to prince albert and his brother the  queen herself appears to be familiar with scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j we are told that brown gave her a copy of the poems of the ettrick shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things it is said in various places that lady churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books this is to be regretted though anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure a similar silence is observed with respect to the queens tastes in the arts wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte that her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence it is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is though sole business of the book to present but while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the queen must have thought and written frequently the following passage on a visit to abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to abbotsford the wellknown residence of sir walter scott it lies low and looks rather gloomy mr hope scott and lady victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present duke of norfolk with their children the young duke of norfolk and some other relations received us mr hope scott married first miss lockhart the last surviving grandchild of sir walter scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of sir walter they showed us the part of the house in which sir walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his ms of ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx sir walter had himself collected then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of sir walter in the study we saw his journal in which mr hope scott asked me to write my name which i felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others we went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are sir walters last clothes we ended by going into the diningrcom in which sir walter scott died where we took tea in this connexion it may be mentioned that when the queens uncle and early guardian leopold king of the belgians travelled in scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the princess charlotte he was for a few days the guest of sir walter scott at abbotsford while there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way an aged scotch divine alluded to the fact that though king was descended from frederick the wise elector of saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the reformation and to become a protector of martin luther thereupon leopold said that he felt more honoured by though mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay the relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the queen herself says in these  leaves of the strong protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of scotland her majesty s love of the highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment that she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough above all things the queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to carlyle goethe was the first to say  come let us make a description it will be remembered that the passages of the queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her majestys visits to poor highland women there was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to though queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman the present volume contains two such peep into highland life and the one we quote fresents us with though last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow grant on sunday august 22 1869 i went to see old mn grant whom i was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and i fear dying of dropsy on august 20 i again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way i took her hand and held it on the 27th she died on the 28th i stopped at her cottage and went in with louise and leopold we found all so clean and tidy but all so silent mrs gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death she had on the socks i gave her the day before yesterday she was in her eightyninth year probably the most enjoyable of these  leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the highlands here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep at a quarter to twelve i drove off with louise and leopold in the waggonette up to near the  bush the residence of william brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep this is a practice pursued all over the highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man james brown my shepherd though elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then william and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry to the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tyre and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough a very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping it was a very curious and picturesque sight more pathetic is the following  tuesday june ll 1872  brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time i was dreadfully shocked it was the child of a man named rattray who lives at cairnnacraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper abercrombies house not far from monaltrie farmhouse in the street at a little before five set off in the waggonette with beatrice and janie ely and drove along the north side of the river we stopped a little way beyond tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest they were searching everywhere while we were there the ol grandmother catenach by name who lives at souttar hole came running along in a great state of distress she is rattrays mother we drove on a little way and then turned round we heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at monaltrie burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below mrs pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the dee this burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen the little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the dee and carried along too dreadful  it seems from what i heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one we drove back and up to mrs grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  wednesday june 12  drove up to the bush to warn mrs william brown never to let dear little albert run about alone or near to the burn of though danger of which she was quite aware she said her husband william had started off early at three this morning some people went down to abergeldie and as far as the girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle no word of the poor child being found all were to start early to search that the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the queens domestic life in truth her majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment so long ago as the year of the queens accession the marquis of londonderry writing to the duke of buckingham said i hear melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection thia fact her premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience that these  leaves contain much moro about mr john brown than about lord beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise the book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers naturally enough brown became essential to the queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy it is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of browns robust independence and simple usefulness we do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship ,folklore_contra

sea beyond she could see the roads leading to daniell and brandon winding like unrolled ribbons through the woods greenness like a hollow ocean spread itself out before her and in the forest the darkness as the sun went down seemed to form itself into caverns and grottoes and strange fantastic shapes in the solid greenness deep in the woods the birds still hooted and sang unweariedly the cawing of crows the tinkle of bells and the iowing of cattle were distinctly audible swarms of flies skirmished in the sunbeams before her eyes in the grass crickets sang a rich fresh smell from the water the woods the wild flowers floated up and regaled her sense the surface of the pond as the sun receded broke into gold ripples deepening gradually into carmine and vermilliop between her eye nnd

the hollows grow darker and darker the little rosecoloured clouds melted away in their evening joy nnd went up to rest in the dark unfathomable chambers ofthe heavens the broad massive clouds grew darker and dimmer nnd extended themselves like hugebreasted lions couchart to watch all night near the gate of the sun margaret sat there alone with no eye but gods to look upon her she sat as if for her the sun had gone down and thc tky unloosed its glory she sat mute and undisturbed as if she were the childqueen of this great pigeant of nature we might have found more entertaining passages than this  but they would suffer in being disjoined from the context there is an account of a thunderstorm by which margaret is overtaken in the depths ofthe forest and an account of how all the inhabitants ofthe neighbourhood join in rescuing her which is a most lifelike and spirited description it is too long however to quote margaret lives in a state of religious heathenism for a long time

co this latest production of mm erckmannchatrian is founded on the francogerman war of 187071 and may be the first of a series of fictions on that theme and similar to those its authors have written on the french wars in the beginning of the century it is a history of the recent war written from the point of view of a welltodo inhabitant of a village lying between alsace and lorraine and gives a vivid and truthful picture of the condition and sentiments of the french peasantry during the continuance of the struggle although as a work of art this novel is not inferior to any of the previous war stories of mm erckmannchatrian it is not likely to acquire an equal degree of popularity either in this country or in france its authors have in a large measure been forestalled by the newspaper correspondents so much indeed has been written on this war that the public interest in it has for a time at least been surfeited  and there are no incidents in the novel of a sufficiently striking kind to excite an appetite that has so recently been gorged with authentic descriptions of ali the horrors heroisms terrors and excitements attendant on a successful invasion  the story of the plebiscite will in all probability be considered tame and wearisome far too much space is occupied with accounts of the movements of the armies and with rumours of all sorts which are generally proved to be false almost as soon as they are reported  but this portion of the work is doubtless a faithful representation of the state of mind of the french peasantry throughout the campaign christian weber the narrator of the story is mayor and miller of rothalp in dosenheim when the war breaks out having inherited the mill from his grandfather and been a frugal prudent man christian has scraped together an independence for life and what with his official dignity and the honour reflected on him from his relationship with a match manufacturer of paris who married a rich innkeepers widow and

honest men respond  thats the truth thats the opinion of monsieur le maire this worthy man has not undertaken to write a history of the war without having an object in view he wishes to show in general how many evilminded people there are in the world and in particular now the inhabitants of rothalp were deceived after the most abominable fashion by the sousprefets the prefets tthlnisters e

never been translated into english before and in this country at least arc still less known although to one or two of our playwrights and novelists a few of the more striking and picturesque 4 situations  have with certain changes of local colour supplied serviceable help indeed except incompletely  il pecorone  has not been rendered into a foreign tongue the objections to it as a book for family reading are precisely those which apply to the 4 decameron and its successors but they are less considerable the writer has substituted for boccaccios garden party the authorised interviews in a convent parlour at forli of a beautiful young nun by name saturnia and her most exemplary admirer the 44 wellmannered youth of florence auretto for five  and  twenty successive days did this admirable pair meet platonically in the parlour and each tell a story mr waters in his erudite introductory essay not only relates so much as he has been able to gather about ser giovanni individually but recounts the history of his book as well as of the sources of some of the tales he incorporated and the manner and whereabouts of the few adaptations of them or parts of them which appeared after their publication a large proportion had with certain minor differences already appeared in older 44novellieri and it is fair to say with mr waters that ser giovannis versions do really 44gain in decency if not in dramatic force in the latter element they are not at all deficient at thc same time let us add that here and there a certain directness of description and vivacity is by no means wanting in  il pecorone which however knows little or nothing of the occasional coarseness of the decameron be this as it may the reader cannot fail to notice in the earlier portions of the compilation stories of the same character as those of which the 4 decameron is full while in the latter part the tales are so to say more or less travesties of legitimate histories quaint and vivid inversions of the truth for example a version of her history and of her taking for her second husband the son of the duke of bavaria ser giovanni ignored the first of her spouses  is related with a charming naivete by auretto to saturnia which would have surprised the countess matilda further on we hear how attila overthrew florence how charlemagne became emperor how the world was divided into three parts and how eneas passed from troy into italy of mr hughess illustrations the pity is that there are so few of them of the best it is impossible to speak too highly the charms of his ladies are undeniable from those of madonna giovanna watching her indignant husband to those of the naked countess matilda defying her spouse it is with nude and graceful figures mr hughes as in previous

good fortune and display their strong points extraordinarily picturesque invention insight and dramatic feeling to advantage the startling originality of the conception of jesus taken up into a high mountain the huge figure of the demon looming in twilight behind him may be compared with  jesus ministered to by angels where he sleeps and the guardians outstretched hands touch his garments both these works are striking examples of the power of the designer the composition called nathaniel under the figtree is a good specimen of his treatment of oriental landscape decidedly impressive is the

B3445,['8676479'],  the secret dispatch  or the adventures of cap tam balgonie by james grant virtue cv uo russians must look back with a strange mixture of pride and pain to the thirtyfour years reign of catherine the second it is certain that none of her predecessors had ruled the people with a more iron hand or crushed them into ignobler bondage yet it may be questioned if any did more to raise the status of the empire in the eyes of the world to improve its social condition or to sow the seeds of that progress which has been steadily devel oping itself it is matter for surprise indeed  that this critical epoch in russian history has j not attracted far more attention than it has two facts are perhaps the best explanations  that can be given of the neglect one is that little as the rest of europe knows even now j with any certainty of what is going on in the  great eastern country our information today  bears a greater proportion to the information attainable then than the news of english i papers bears to the news of a hundred  years ago the other is that it is only within  the memory of living men that russia has begun to be included even in the range of civili ization much less regarded as a country capable  of anything better than spasmodic changes and unsystematic vagaries whatever the causes however the period from 1762 to 1796 is undoubtedly worthy of vastly more notice than has been given to it and from the pages of levesque mannstein and villebois at least enough can be got to reward the pains of reading them the story and character of catherine alone form a romance by themselves a comj parative parvenue beside ninetenths of her ooort intoxicated by suddenly finding herself rife of a man whose weakness and debaucheries yjrtually transferred an empire to her hands possessed of a clearheadedness which prevented even her intoxication being more than a useful ally of an ambition which disdained the thought of any restingplace of a heartlessness which stopped at nothing and of an intellect before which the most unmanageable bowed trusted by nobody and hated by all and hardly recognising such a consideration as personal expediency  this medley of profligacy good taste selfishness and generosity eclipses in our eyes her more famous predecessor peter this characterthe patron of art science and  education the originator of a methodical administration of justice the introducer of vaccination among her subjects the founder unless we are mistaken of the second foundling hospital in the world and the inpersonation of cruelty aud vice  mr grant has chosen for the foundation of his hst historical novel it is not often that we have to complain of novelists that they do not make their books long enough but we cannot  help thinking a mistake has for once been committed in the present case better materials than catherines entire reign we need hardly  say nobody could have had at handall the  better for a work of fiction by reason of the frequent absence of certainty as to minutia mr grant however though he has studied his subject has selected one little incident one of the darkest amid a crowd of dark ones and contented himself with moulding it into a onevolume tale the incident is this on the death of anne in 1742 her grandnephew ivan the sixth styled by mr grant ivan the  fourth had succeeded to the thronean infant less than a year oldonly however to be deposed and imprisoned within a few months by elizabeth when elizabeths successor peter the third was in his turn deposed and imprisoned by his wife catherine the latter found ivan now a youth of about twentyfour a dangerous obstacle to her security  and on the discovery of a conspiracy to restore him to his rights at once had him privately put to death in his dungeon out of this it is that the volume before us is constructedthe secret dispatch being the empresss order for the assassination sent to the governor of the state prison by one of the many british officers then in the russian service the perils he went through in carrying his charge from novgorod to st petersburg the chapter of accidents by which he became betrothed to the sister of the chief conspirator and the eminently disagreeable complications to which his loveaffairs led interwoven with a few pictures of russian society are the sumtotal of a book which might with advantage have been three times as long as to what there is we have no hesitation in saying it is worth reading probably indeed it gains in interest about as much as it loses by want of substance a little lovetale of only three years scope if it is well toldas this is just melancholy enough to enlist ones sympathies ending just happily enough not to bring on the blues and keeping the sentimental part of ones nature on perpetual tenterhooks by all sorts of lifeordeath tossups has something pleasant in its very sound and as a novel of this kind it is undoubtedly the most successful the author oas produced as an historical one we have already expressed disappointment on one ground and on another point we wink there is a want of sound judgment history put into the persuasive form of fiction ttght not to be altered more than is absolutely requisite for the purposes of art not only do all such unnecessary changes prevent a book being of real use but they are apt to do positive harm by causing it to leave wrong impressions behind why then should mr grant have gone out of his way to represent the incident on which the whole of his story turns differently from the fact  it would have been just as easy to mould his plot on the true account of mierowitzs mad conspiracy as on a purely imaginative one while no interest whatever is added by the gratuitous inaccuracy of representing the conspirators attacking ivans prison from without instead of according to unanimous authority taking advantage of their position as the garrison of the fortress itself in minor details such as mierowitzs social grade the actual origin of his animosity towards catherine and in others of little or no importance the romancer is fairly entitled to his licence but the best principle on which to go from step to step is that the less deviation there is from fact the better we should be sorry however to convey to anybody the idea that the book is on the whole untrustworthy on the contrary it contains more than one excellent sketch of russian social life in the last century,folklore_contra

in general and the relative positions of men and women iu particular but we do not want to iv ad for our amusement and relaxation a catalogue of calamities which happen to people every day and may happen to ourselves before we die for aught we know there is no use in studying the subject of ruined fortunes broken hearts crippled limbs povertyscandal illnature from those of our own household and resentment and faithlessness in those we love and trust the most it is all true enough that thee tilings do constantly happen in the world and will continue to happen as long as the world lasts but let us bide our time it will not make our own miseries less bitter to know that it is only the common lot of man and that after all other people have been quite as unfortunate as ourselves or that a fabulous doris fletcher has been through more than wo have and yet born it very patiently in taking up a novel we hope to forget our little personal griefs and wrongs for a time at least we wish to be taken out of ourselves and amused and cheered and not to have the melancholy fact thrust back upon us that no one is to be trusted that women are persecuted injured beings who are not allowed to earn even an honest livelihood that our purest motives and our most innocent actions are sure to be misinterpreted and misrepresented  and that in short we have only to do our best and prepare for the worst it may be all very true but it is dishearteniug doctrine to preach and more likely to enervate and enfeeble than to strengthen and encourage the youthful novelreader and elderly people do not require warning and as a rule never read melancholy books  they have had too many troubles of their own to take much interest in  doris fletcher or any other heroine of romance  but a good joke or a cheerftd anecdote would b  pleasant to them we begin the story ofthe fletchers by finding them bankrupt and ruined the father irritable and querulous the sons emigrating the mother heartbroken doris the daughter by the first wife mourning her lover who though true to her died just as he ought to have married her and made her happy ursula the eldest daughter of the present mrs fletcher is odious and unnatural and connie is rather a silly little beauty who is petted by every one except ursula and perfectly worshipped by her halfsister doris who only wishes to be to her  as a special providence that she may guard her from all the evils and temptations of this wicked world on finding themselves ruined the fletcher family retire to a small village on the seacoast called redcross where they fall in with the usual amount of elderly young ladies and widows and doctors and clergymens families and go to tiresome little teaparties and dorcas meetings and picnics c just as people always do in country villages doris is quiet and demure and takes pleasure in seeing connie happy but ursula is fine about it and is bored to death and gives herself airs and grows jealous of connie ursulas character is overdrawn and as must sometimes happen in autobiographies the narrator is very onesided in her views thus doris gives us to understand that ursula had not one good or pleasing quality in her she cannot move look or speak without being guilty of some mean or spiteful action whereas connie is just as incapable of having a fault or a failing in the eyes of doris at least it is another version of cinderella and the cruel sisters but it is not true to nature they are both commonplace women to be met with every day the one sweetened by beauty and affection the other soured by adversity and thc consciousness that she is not appreciated at home in spite of herself doris gives ursula some fine traits and it is a decided mistake to make her refuse a good offer of marriage for herself and yet pursue constance with such vindictive and relentless spite because she also has a lover very poor and very disagreeable whom she does wish to marry and whom we are distinctly told ursula certainly did not love herself yet no other reason would account for her dislike to her young sister or for the very strong measures she took to sever her from dr julius eden who was but a harsh suspicious man after all and not worthy of all the wretchedness and illhealth the little one bestowed upon his shortcomings as for doris she hates ursula fully as much as ursula hates connie and judges her quite as hardly and a more uncomfortable family party can scarcely be imagined and yet one sees how it might be true if it were not so exaggerated and so partially delineated ursula is at last determined to stand it no longer and takes a situation in a noblemans family in the neighbourhood where we are led  to suppose she has every discomfort under though sun only she is too proud to own the fact and chooses out of spite to say she is very happy as indeed she probably might have been if doris could have believed it possible being out herself ursula cannot rest till she hunts o  connie out as well and she accordingly finds a mrs tom claridge a forsaken wife who wishes for a nursery governess dr julius is furious because old mr fletcher will not consent to his marrying connie till he has enough to live upon and still more irate at ins future wife  being a governess and finally when connie hastily comes home having been insulted by mr tom claridge and gone through a scene with his jealous wifejust at the very moment when her fiance should have stepped forward and guarded her from all evil reports and unpleasant stories dr julius cuts her dead sends back her letters without a word and breaks off all communication with her family and only because she did not in a letter tell him the whole particulars of her leaving the claridge family so naturally enough redcross and ursula begin to  talk  and to suspect connie must be to blame connies illness and nervousness and despair and ursulas cruelty are all related at great length and with painful minuteness and though the quarrel is duly made up at the end of the book and ursula is forbidden the house of her brotherinlaw we cannot help thinking connie must have had rather a trying time of it with her hard uncompromising doctor then there is another mistakedoriss heart being supposed to be buried in the grave of her true lover she thinks she is justified in setting up a iifrimdna dangerous amusement  but we have some pages of reasoning upon the injustice of the world in not allowing men and women to be friends without being  talked about doris is very devoted to her friend an eccentric and maundering kind of man and she goes to see him and his old mother and he comes to see her and they tell each other everything till at last one day doris sees him walking with another elderly young lady a mutual friend to whom it seems he was once engaged many years before doris declares and protests she was not the least  in love with mr westmore and we suppose we are in duty bound to believe her yet why if he were a mere friend need she turn so faint and blind and dizzy that she stumbles over a precipice in going home and so becomes a cripple for life i never loved mr westmore she says as my friend i prized himand as my friend only the sting of it was that he would want me no longer since he had found his earliest and best sympathiser in the woman he had been attached to formerly some persons seem to think thero is no jealousy except in the passion of love but friends can be very resentful of an intruder between them it would be rather inconvenient however miss doris if all women were to take the marriages of their  friends and their friends onlyso very much to heart as not to be able to walk straight or to see their way home after hearing of them what are they to do when they are in love if this is a specimen of pure friendship  if though friend had been a miss westmore would doris have cared either doris is not true to herself or the story is grievously  out of

for vengeance had longed and prayed now at lastbut we had better leave the reader to discover what vengeance nora took such is the story improbable as it seems told in rough outline which mr neumann

literary tastes wbilch had more than once induced her it was said to open a correspondence with the editor of a local paper and to offer to supply both the poetry and the leading articles on very moderate terms as well as to regale the editor who lived at boltby with tea and toast whenever he felt inclined to walk as far as graybourne no one seemed very clear as to the result of these overtures but miss downing was always suspoeted of being the author of several heroic and didactic compositions which from time to time had appeared in the poets corner of the shire instructor and which were signed semiramis in temper and disposition min downing was really a pattern to elderly spistore in general being cheerful contented an as far as a pared on the surface entirely reconciled

which she wore in ringlets that wen always out of curl and somewhat wiry in texture but her blue eyes were soft and pensive and there were some sweet tones in her low and rather melancholy voice which united with her general appearance and invalid state gave her a claim to be reckoned by most persons of the other sex as an interesting woman jane norton the niece whom thes kindhearted t idies had adopted on the death of her ppenbt was a brighteyed girl of about eighteen not pretty not graceful certainly not clever and yet with a qusint odd charm about her that it would be very idifcult to define her aunts were very fond of her and allowed her to do exactly what she pleased and the consequence was she did nothing when site was not playing with the cat but a little needtle work on her own account and spent altogether as idle and profitless a life as could well be imagined her fat good humour keen observance and love of softfurred animal pets culminating in her affection for  blabberty cutsoms a pet dormouse makes her in mrs mackenzsie daniels hands quite a character it is only where the wicked people with their wicked ways come on the stage of the story that though author dwarfs her own conceptions and disappoints the expectations of her readers by her evident fear of entering the list of the sensationalist but the character of meta belongs of right to that class of novels and loses half its vigour by being transposed to the calm fore ground of respectable domesticity her un scrupulous deeds lack action and become tame enough when recorded at second hand also her

naturally expect that he was about to commence reading a tale of terrible interestof hulnan frivolity and sin followed by overwhelming shame and sufferingof cruelty and wrong triumphant for a time but overtaken at last and clutched by the dread avenger but instead of passion we have pietyinstead of licence unchecked we have tutored lives running carefully in the most conventional grooves and  the whirlwind so far as we can see has yet to be reaped the saints in mrs mckenzie daniels novel are many but the sinners indeed are few there is not a good thoroughgoing scamp in the whole book and the little fairhaired clever german girl who does the flirting and is for her very pardonable love of admiration supposed to  reap the whirlwind is thrown among a set so intensely proper and milkandwaterish that we regard the poor thing as more sinned against than sinning mrs daniels books will always be welcome at the dorcas society and often read aloud no doubt to the members thereof much to their edification but if she wishes to address that wider audience which is called the public she must make her books more human and the first step in that direction would be to make her country rectors men as well as parsons here is an outline of the story mrs beamish is the widow of a country clergyman and not being left particularly well off she agrees that her two daughters gertrude and ethel having finished their education should open a boardingschool in the large house at lindenhurst which the generosity of a friend had enabled them to take with this end in view arrangements had been made with their german cousin meta kauffman for her coming over to england and joining them in the labours of the school the two sisters have not yet finished their own education when they receive a letter from their mother announcing the rather sudden arrival of this german cousin and soliciting the return of one or other of them immediately in order that the stranger in a strange land might not be without a companion this letter rather puzzles the sisters at first but the younger of the two who is the teller of the whole story guesses very properly to this effect  it is simply as it seems to me that meta kauffman has turned out to be a young lady of sufficient personal and mental attractions to make a dangerous 1eteatete companion day after day for our sensitive if not susceptible brother and mamma who is easily frightened catches hold of the first straws that she sees floating towards her in this dire extremity if aleta had only been content to remain in her happy fatherland a few weeks longer guy would have been safe at cambridge and you and i quite free to devote ourselves to the young persons entertainment by the time ethel arrives however the mischief is done and her impressionable brother guy is the adoring slave of the goldenhaired meta the cousin moreover never joins in the school but accepts a situation as governess in a neighbouring family to which she is recommended by mrs arnott a lively young widow whose acquaintance she has converted into a friendship the fascinating manners and wonderful singing of the new governess gain the good opinions of every one and it is even whispered that young edmund hallam heir to the earldom of clinton thinks more of her than he does of alicia clarkson the young lady to whom lhe is engaged in the meantime the two sisters open school with three or four pupils among whom is included little maggie the delicate child of the new rector his visits become frequent and result in his engagement to ethel he is a grave man of middle age superhumanly modest and saintlike in his piety ethels affection for hin is also of the supernal kind she does not so much love as worship him meta kauffmans engagement as governess at the vivians ends abruptly and she returns to the sisters in disgrace it is now that the rev harold wvyke sees her and looking at her for the first time and much to his astonishment he recognises in meta kauffman mrs alan beresford to whose dying husband at heidelberg he had administered the last sacrament some four years ago on discovering the frivolity of her nature he had very soon repented of his marriage and in order that lie might ultimately shake her off he had persuaded her that that marriage was an irregular one and their little boy illegitimate this he told the clergyman when dying and that that same little boy whom he had placed with maiden aunts of his in devonshire was the real heir to the earldom of clinton it was for seducing the affections of edmund hallam the supposed heir to the earldom that meta was disgraced and now that she discovered that she herself was the mother of the future earl she loses no time in writing to the man whom she had betrayed disclaiming all future connexion with him and starts at once for devonshire to recover her lost boy this journey into devonshire where we pur posely leave the reader and the discovering of alan earl of clinton is by far the most powerfully written part of the 1ook and perhaps the most touching thing mrs daniel has yet written the various scenes with maggie too are all genuine transcripts from nature so no doubt re the teaparties but the eternal twaddle of a v tage the gossip of the old maids and the visits u the parson are not exactly the things with which a threevolume novel with any pretensions in it ought to be filled reaping the whirlwind is an advance upon miriams sorrow which we reviewed some time ago but if mrs daniel means to become a real artist

B1946,['8691054'],  poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,folklore_contra

with mr reades merits and with his faults we ali know his power of giving interest to a story and holding us bound and unable to lay the book down till we have read to the very end not that we may solve a riddle as is the way with too many novelistshe never keeps the secret till the endbut solely that we may know how everybody is to escape from the difficulties in which he delights to plaoe his characters and that we may enjoy to the full his ingenuity in keeping distinct every thread of the seemingly tangled web of his plots we are in the secret the whole time but the personages of the story are not and it is in their gradual enlightenment not in ours that the interest of mr reades novels lies then again how well we know his gift of the most uncompromisingly hard hitting when he has got hold of a social abuse and that not always in vain  this however does not apply in the present case he has no doubt a little fling at his old foe the private asylum but strange to relate this time the asylum is kept by a doctor who is neither a fool nor a ruffian but an agreeable and somewhat scientific mau for whom mr read evidently has a slight liking we say has a liking advisedly for one of our authors great merits is the personal knowledge so to speak which he always has of his characters of course he sees them through readean spectacles  that is they say and do things which no mortal ever said or did  they insert unnecessary pronouns and auxiliary verbs in conversation and talk in capitals and italics large type and small and so forth  but still they are creatures and not puppets and we feel interested in them and feel too when we have finished the book that we have added to our list of acquaintances having generalised sufficiently we proceed to give a short outline of  a terrible temptation nor shall we thereby interfere with the pleasure of possible readers for as we have said mr reades stories do not depend for their interest on unexpected revelations at the end of th e third volume the story then is as follows there are two cousins of the name of bassett sir charles baronet and richard the father of richard though the elder son and heir to an entailed property has been before the opening of the story compelled in order to pay his debts to sell the reversion to his father the grandfather of the cousins and to join him in cutting off the entail the property and estate of lluntercombe has accordingly descended to the father of sir charles who for political services was made a baronet at the beginning of the story we find the cousins in rivalry for the hand of a beautiful miss arabella bruce she naturally prefers the baronet who though decidedly  fast has besides his title and property a more pleasant disposition than his cousin the latter who has never forgiven the arrangement by which the property was lost to him is further stung to fury by his defeat and casts about to get his revenge fortune favours him so far that he discovers a liaison between sir charles and a certain miss somerset whose position in life may be understood when we say that she lives in a sumptuous house in mayfair is the admiration of duchesses in the park and expresses herself on one occasion thus the words were we believe once really used lucky for you beggars that i am a lady or i would break every dd window in the house  and the introduction of this person reminds us of a fault of mr reades which we cannot pass over in silence such things arenor do wo so much object to their use for purposes of fiction though we think he has dwelled unnecessarily on miss somerset and given us a little too much of the private life of the demimonde  but we must regret the want of reticence which he shows in alluding in other places to matters which are usually passed over lightly by most modern masters of at least english fiction we do not point out the passages for fear of laying ourselves open to a similar reproach but again we say we regret it for it renders it absolutely impossible for us to put this book with all its merits into the hands say of our unmarried sisters to resume the story richard bassett by means of an anonymous letter succeeds in breaking off the match for a time at a moment too when sir charles has just severed at some expense to himself the ties which bound him to the lady of doubtful reputation and has made up his mind to live as an homme range the lovers are in despair but the truth comes out through the intervention of miss somerset herself and they are at length married richards malice pursues them however he annoys sir charles by every means small and great in his power saves money and buys small farms bordering on his cousins estate shoots his pheasants prosecutes him unsuccessfully for a libel and ultimately succeeds in getting him shut up in the asylum to which we have already alluded now appears the dens ex machind without whom no novel of mr reades would be complete whom we already know under the guise of dr sampson martin wittenhaagen dr amboyne and others  the person of rough exterior and rude manners but possessed of a ready invention and an inexhaustible willingness to use it in the service of his neighbours in the present instance it is one mr rolfe a novelist who knows everybody and all about them and who undertakes the job con amore meanwhile lady bassett has yielded to the terrible temptation which gives its name to the book they have been married some years and she is still childless she perceives and is made wretched by perceiving her husbands mortification and goaded by the fear of losing his affection she contrives with the assistance of her maid to deceive him and the world by a pretended confinement and to pass off another womans child as her own this maid is the sister of rhoda somerset the former mistress of sir charles and has by a series of chances directed more or less by richard bassett who is enamoured of her come into the service of lady bassett the supposititious heir is her illegitimate son by richard by the time the deception is complete sir charles has been freed from the asylum and returns home delighted at having at last an heir the remainder of the story is occupied with lady bassetts perplexities and miseries arising from her fault through which we will not take our readers it will be sufficient to say that richard suspects something of the truth that sir charles is not the father of the boy but is on an entirely wrong scent that children are born bond fide to the baronet and his wife that our former acquaintance miss somerset turns up again married respectably and with a turn for preaching like a famous predecessor of hers in real life that circumstances render it necessary for lady bassett to confess her fault at the moment when richard thinks he has played his masterstroke of revenge and that a reconciliation between the cousins cemented by though marriage of sir charless real heir to richards daughter ends the book the story as we have said is told with all mr reades power and we may add with nearly all his usual eccentricity of style we do not think on the whole that we should like to see him alter this for without it he would not be the charles read that we know but we hope no one else will imitate it for what is tolerable chiefly by reason of its originality would be an intolerable affectation if not original one question wc should like to ask before concluding where in the world did mr read get hold of the lunatics invention of the  airloom of which he even reproduces the diagram  after reading it we feel almost mad ourselves it produces the same effect upon us as does an hours conversation with a person whose mind is deranged and we can only say that if mr read evolved it from his own consciousness he possesses to a most extraordinary degree the power of mentally  putting himself in the place  of the character whom he desires to depict  new novels 1 terrible temptation a story of the day by charles reade in three volumes chapman and hall mr reades usual way of novelwriting is almost too well known to need criticising if he will be good enough to break new ground again as he did once and with excellent result in  the cloister and the hearth he will certainly produce a work calling for lengthy comment and one that we may be pretty sure will call for hearty praise we do not say that  a terrible temptation does not deserve praise but there is hardly anything more to be said about it than has been said about his earlier  stories of the day if it is not quite as much of a novel with a purpose  as some others it is quite as realistic quite as j clever and quite as irritating no one wdio reads the first  chapter of one of his tales can abstain from reading on to  the end  but when we have read the book through we j feel that we have been dragged through a dissecting room i and forced to look at a ghastly array of diseased limbs i listening all the time to an anatomical lecture that i3 quite true but by no means amusing mr read is a social anatomist of great power and he generally makes it his business to discourse about social diseases that is a good thing to do now and then at any rate and even through novels if by novels the public can be most influenced but he who does it should never forget that in exposing the diseases his duty is to show how they may be avoided mr read does sometimes forget this and he has forgotten it especially in a terrible temptation this novel has no moral at all unless its purpose be to prove that lying is sometimes a good thing and that wives ought sometimes to deceive their husbands unless we except a mad doctor who has not much to do with the story and a boy and girl who are brought in merely to untie the knot which the author has made every person in this novel is disagreeable the plot of the novel is also disagreeable it begins and continues in hatred malice and all uncharitableness and if it does not end therewith this group of vices is only withdrawn to make room for exemplification of the novel doctrine that dishonesty is the best policy at any rate in the case of wives whose husbands smoke so much as to interfere with the development of species the husband who thus errs is sir charles bassett a rich man who falls in love after the ordinary amount of dissipation and who marries the object of his affections after considerable difficulties the author of these difficulties is his cousin richard bassett who thinks that he has been defrauded of the family possessions and who is accordingly very anxious to get them back or at any rate to secure their descent to his son when he gets one he not only wants sir charles not to marry but would like to be himself the husband of the lady of sir charless choice therefore he brings to light and shows in false colours a liaison between sir charles and a fashionable prostitute whose ways and dispositions are described with remarkable precision and who in due time is converted and brought forward as a very successful openair preacher sir charles bassett however breaks through the snare set for him by his wicked cousin and the wicked cousin has to lay other snares which provide much of the material of the novel it is to counteract them and one of them in particular that sir charles bassetts wife yields to  a terrible temptation having no child of her own she pretends to have one and by an ingenious contrivance of the authors the baby she adopts is an illegitimate child of richard bassetts the advantages of that contrivance are evident it gives a subtle charm to the working out of richard bassetts schemes for the injuring of his own son and when that son grows up and proves an utterly worthless fellow it gives wonderful point to a scene which might have been written for the melodramatic stage in which richard bassett having with a refinement of cruelty planned that sir charles shall send his own son to trial for housebreaking discovers that he and not his cousin is the boys father we need not tell more of mr reades plot or name more of his characters that those characters are skilfully described need not be said but if they are natural they are graceless whether they sin much or little they sin on to the end and the only reflection to be drawn from their careers is that sin if rather ugly and troublesome works its own cure when sir charles bassett having reduced his daily allowance of cigars lady bassett has a son of her own she continues to deceive her husband about the reputed heir on very frivolous grounds and she deceives him to the end her virtue being thereby apparently enhanced though it is true that she is not represented as being quite as virtuous as the sometime courtesan who becomes a streetpreacher we should have been grateful to mr read had he really attacked some of the false conventionalities of the day and shown that true morality may be very different from the morality of either pulpit or drawingroom ethics but  a terrible temptation does not show that it only shows once again that mr read is a very clever writer,folklore_contra

and fought and swore and loved and was captured and lived in cartagena as a teacher of english and swashed innumerable bucklers and finally came back to devon and some might take it for mere

nivens first book the lost cabin mine which was a simpler setting of adventure in modern times mr nivens very knowledge betrays him in chapter xii into a sudden change of key so vivid is the description of a fight on board the torridge maid so obviously the description of an eyewitness the island providence is a book that must be read there is more in it than can be mentioned in a review there is to begin with life and philosophy  mr frederick niven the island providence bv frederick niven 6s john lane when mr frederick nivens first book the lost cabin mine was published those who had been told it was a firstborn agreed that it had great promise but had they been ignorant of this they might have recognised not only promise but accomplishment that book contained features new to english romance in his second book mr niven comes into line with the great tradition of the english novel as distinct from the tale of romantic adventure he has added something to the novel as such not form not perhaps treatment although somewhat of the latter but more particularly temperament he is smollett spiritualised smollett with inward vision his style is nervous and intense and not yet entirely free of its masters but it is always strong with the masculine note of the best part of the seventeenth century but above all things mr niven is honest so honest at times that he himself even is forced to pause and admire his admiration of his own frankness takes an apologetic form but it is a conceit none the less and a criticism of our squeamish age as well as for instance his  pardon me gentlemen after the tragicomic accident to the breeches of little john upcott the appeal to gentlkeicu is excellent satire all the same and again in the grim realism of chapter xii where in a description of a sailors fracas he stops before the recital of a particularly gruesome incident to remind us that  this is lite not a story in which only pretty things happen indeed  the island providence  is not a story at all it is a novel in the best sense of an abused word it is a slice of life at the close of the seventeenth century starting in devonshire among peasants and seafaring men continuing among buccaneers and desperadoes in the indies and closing in devon again with lovelorn upcott the central figure gazing with puckered eves    into the nothingness faro beyond the verge of the climbing sea the book abounds w ith incident but never for the sake of incident all its stirring occurrences are mosaics in the building of character some might urge that upcotts character is indefinite but this would be a shallow view upcott only appears indefinite because he is revealed before a background which expands over half a world the rest of the characters are vivid miniatures some like mrs upcott cassandra and tomasina old uncle ravenning and captain avery are delightful whilst there are several which move almost uncivilised emotions he possesses a keen sense of the romance of reality mingling his frankness and his exact powers of observation with a curious oldworld pose which makes his style strut and peacock itself like a man who sets his hat at a raffish angle for vanity but behind it all there is a robust optimism  he believes things will right themselves eventually and in such a happy fatalism he wveaves his intensely tragic theme with deliberate and obvious artifice accomplishing a memorable piece of reading and good literature  the uland providence by frederick niven john lane mr niven must be welcomed to the ranks of novelists who really count he has imagination and a vivid power of setting forth life which should carry him far this story is in essence a patch of life cut out of the closing quarter of the seventeenth century mr niven has taken a youth of that period living in north bevon has in a few graphic chapters painted his home life and the barbaric conditions of the times and has thence introduced him to the searovers of the spanish main the faults of the book he in its disconnectedness but it is largely the discontinuity of biography one feels that john upcott is a real person and actually went through the adventures here related crudities there are in the volume but the narrative has force and carries conviction except that the atmosphere in which the tale concludes seems modernized it was unnecessary and one is

of a more adequate conception and what shall we say of paul and ted  the one is only sallow cheeks a black beard and a few phrases while the other is a riotous and hazy figure with about twenty words of a vocabulary in which  rotten and  hump are the most in use with pain we recognise the unflinching realism of the portrait  the making of a prig by evelyn sharp lane is perl writer as miss sharp should gratuitously it is perhaps a pity that so charming a bh burden herself with an arbitrary and unwarrantable title katharine austen cannot be said to come under any one of the recognised definitions of the prig proper she is at worst or best a child of naturea frank tomboy when we meet her who developes into a very lovable woman under the influence of a strong passion which she is innocent enough to advertise quite openly we are to judge that this very innocence which allows her to visit paul wilton in his chambers uninvited at an unusual hour of the evening finally moves that gentleman to condemn her as a prig for not responding to the feeling into which his rather bloodless nature has been surprised  you cant help it he tells her now and again nature makes woman a prig and it is only the right man who can regenerate her unfortunately circumstances prevent me from being the right man to do katharine justice she is as much troubled as the reader to discover her claim to the title to her father the most exquisitely irresponsive of audiences she ultimately confides her solution of the enigma  a prig is one who tries to break what the ordinary person is pleased to call the law of nature and to substitute the law of his own reason instead  the world wont tolerate ideals it sneers at us for trying to find out new ways of being good now to get a bad name is to go far towards deserving it and it would certainly seem by this sort of speech that katharine is in a fair way to become the thing which she has been very inaccurately called apart from the conclusion which is not worthy of the rest the novel with its comparatively commonplace incidents yet holds the attention by force of its artless sincerity and general reasonableness it presents a most acceptable study of womans character but while it is perhaps only natural and even proper that miss sharp should understand her own sex better than the other there seems no adequate reason why almost all her men should be intolerable it does not appear that she intended this she wishes her readers to understand that paul wilton is a most fascinating personality yet she altogether fails to convince them that a girl of an intelligence so sane and unspoilt could be enamoured of this objectionable egoist when confessedly there was no physical attraction to recommend him his habitual assumption that he has only to lift his little finger to do what he likes with her makes them against their will and apparently against the authors intention despise the girl that could submit to this degradation i cant marry you i dont love you enough for that she said moving restively under his touch he stroked her cheek gently then why do you thrill when i touch you he asked this is almost inconceivably offensive of the other male characters heaton may possibly have been designed for the snob that he is yet he is represented as the personal friend of wilton for whose fastidiousness the author is prepared to vouch ted morton too with all his air of ingenuousness is in his small way a snob but many unimportant sins may be pardoned to the book for the saving grace of its buoyancy and unstudied humour   your cousin is a most interesting psychological study said paul vaguely  what do you mean  she is a very nice girl indeed cried marion indignantly and paul silently condemned the whole sex without reservation the least happy feature of miss sharps humour is to be found in ted mortons very limited slang which betrays the hand of the amateur and  talking of the temple as the inconsequent monty would say in introducing a new topic is miss sharp quite precise in her details  is it not wanton to allude to the thoroughfare from fountain court to the embankment when the authorities have taken the pains to put up a notice on the spot saying that there is no such thing  ,folklore_contra

lands demands her for himself and the wily de foix is well content to purchase such an alliance with the resignation of his sons claim to her the professed object of the novel is to give an account of the manners and customs o the fourteenth century and accordingly throughout the three volumes we are not allowed above one page of genuine story to two of tiresome entangled and foolish description of the exterior and interior of buildings with all their confused intricacies together with the paraphernalia of monkish devotion and chivalric rites surely there is a full abundance of conventional etiquettes of this present day to be gotten by heart without an additional load upon the memories of youth of a mass of exploded reremonial what importance the author attaches to these transient peculiarities of past times is sufficiently manifested by her weaving them into a story the main and declared object of which is an elucidation of them but although there can be no objection to an acquaintance with chivalrous and monkish usages or the cobwebbed corners and passages of abbeys or feudal castles and although one gifted pen has graven their details like spells about our hearts and memories yet we must deprecate the cold study of a thing so evanevcnt and so little applicable to our universal wants and interests for the supply of which universal and permanent truth alone can suffice we consider the able representation of human character under whatever conventionalt forms it may be moulded or in whatever garb arrayed as of the nature of univei truth but the present novel has no claim to ability upon such a score or indeed upon any grounds at all and our duty alone and the sweet consciousness of discharging that zaously and impartially has enabled us to wade through

indifference and absence of mind about domestic trifles his indiscriminate charity his habit of turning his back to the wind for the convenience of taking snuff and then pursuing the direction in

the story  but indeed it is of the slightest we note in janet and donald an aptitude for the appreciation of highland character not very common in scotch novelists and on the whole can honestly welcome a manysided if rather heterogeneous collection of sketches by one who knows his countrymen george umber the author of ayrshire idylls of other days a gardner is as he says a sentimentalist it is also clear that he is a lover of our eighteenth century classics and that he has acquired certain mannerisms from charles lamb apart from this the even flow of reflection and reminiscence neither striking nor profound will attract few readers although for persons completely ignorant of scotland such chapters as the old pew between the preachings c may possess something of novelty it may be conceded that the authors descriptive style is fluent and that the illustrations of mr william findlay are passable there is no excess of vernacular scotch in the book and not a grain of humour the title of mr david lyalls collection of religious stories the land of the leal hodder  stoughton is probably used in its proper sense not that unaccountably adopted by mr gladstone but the series which is strung together loosely through the personality of lisbeth gray the pious wife of staneriggs the farmer has to do with scotland and more particularly with southcountry farmers miners and merchants it cannot be said that the book is particularly exciting or shows a great deal of literary power but some of the tales are pathetic notably that entitled one of the weak things of the world which might the sardonic will say have been the title of the book there is not any great extravagance in vernacular spelling or diction though the authors own narrative is amusingly full of scotticisms on

wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them dr holmes unlike some othersmay still be trusted with a pen did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it i waltek lewin,folklore_contra
B5364,['6709241'],  literature the roots of the mountains by william morris reeves  turner although the characters in mr morriss new romance are set among very archaic surroundings they appear to be essentially of a mediaeval type the men of burgdale are a people of german blood though many of their customs appear to differ from those described in the germania inhabiting a town or thorp in a valley  amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams of a fair land situate apparently somewhere in the southern tyrol the village or little markettown was set in a fortified pass shut in by cliffs and protected by a wall and towers on a knoll near the brow of the cliff the men of old times had built a strong and great watchtower and therefrom the thorp had its name and the whole valley also and it was called burgstead in burgdale there was a space of about fifty acres betwixt the wall and the wandering stream  and therein we are told lay burgstead in a space of  the shape of a swordpummel the houses were all of stone  with much fair and curious carved work of knots and beasts and men round about the doors or whiles a wall of suchlike work all along the housefront the dalesmen were as expert at stonework as their upland neighbours the woodlanders were at carving runes and patterns on their oaken beams the shepherdfolk higher up on the downs lived a ruder life in scattered homesteads and were not very curious in their houses and halls the three folks were united in the bonds of kindred and friendship and formed in fact one rustic state governed by one alderman and meeting in the same folkmote the men of burgdale were great producers of corn and a good red wine which was bought by the foreign merchants they were very successful in goldwashing but the silvermines in the neighbourhoodin silverdale across the mountainshad been seized by a dusky tribe of mongol or hunnish affinities with whose defeat by the dalesmen and their allies the story is principally concerned the men of the dale also sold weapons of such fashions as were used in the westland  and golden cups and chains and fair rings set with mountainblue stones and copper bowls and vessels gilt and parcelgilt and mountainblue for staining the woodlanders brought down woodcarvings and peltries and the shepherds  such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer with the neighbours the marketplace was wherever anyone cared to pitch a booth but we are told that for the most part this was done in the wide street between the gate and the bridge the gradual growth of a commercial town from the trademeetings of countryfolk and foreign chapmen the  nundinae barbarorum of classical description is indicated with great force and precision there is a particularly interesting account of the visit of the men of shadowy yale a murky region into which the wolftribe had been driven by the hunnish savages to the great springmarket at burgstead  gay was the show for the booths were tilted over with painted cloths and the merchants themselves were clad in long gowns of fine cloth scarlet and blue and white and green and blaok with broidered welts of gold and silver and their knaves were gaily attired in short coats of diverse hues with silver rings about their arms and short swords girt to their sides people began to gather about these chapmen at once when they fell to opening their dales and their packs and unloading their wains there had they iron both in pigs and forged scrap and nails steel they had and silver both in ingots and vessel pearls from over sea cinnabar and other colours for staining suoh as were not in the mountains madder from the marshes and purple of the sea and scarlet grain from the holmoaks by its edge and woad from the deep clayey fields of the plain silken thread also from the outer ocean and rare webs of silk and jars of olive oil and fine pottery and scented woods and sugar of the cane the headman of the merchants brings news of a great invasion of dusky men who had overthrown the armies of the cities in the plain and how they had piled up skulls into great hills beside the city gates  and how because of the death and the rapine grass had grown in the kings chambers and the wolves had chased deer in the temples of the gods the prince of the tribe from the murky vale arrives in glorious array with his sister the sunbeam whose courtship by goldmane of burgdale otherwise called faceofgod gives a romantic colour to the story and relieves the readers mind from the gloom of the guerilla war and murders grim and great and the tumult of the long battle in which the felon tribes in rosedale meet their wellearned doom folkright the prince of the wolfrace is a kind of robin hood who only robs a skinflint or occasionally holds a merchant to ransom and it is to be observed that he pays for the purchase of a dagger and a  web of gold and silk as well as a fine for robbery set upon him in the folkmote with the treasure of silver rings wbich his soldiers had taken from their dusky enemies the character of the princess is finely drawn she seems likely at first to be the bringer of strife and misfortune like another helen on the peaceful children of the vale but the threatened evils are fortunately turned full upon the horde of invaders the valiant and beautiful bride who loses her  goldmaned  chieftain is consoled with a new love for folkright and a happy life in the purified halls of silverstead there are plenty of songs interspersed with the story and some of the best are sung by the bride others are sung by an amazonian  bowmay  to the music of woodwonts goodly fiddle and goldmane is called upon for the song of the ford telling how the warriors returned to their cloverfields and meads of mowing grass after a wild battle upon the hills  in haytide through the day newborn across the meads we come our hauberks brush the blossomed corn a furlong short of home another fine poem occurs in the description of a journey to the fotest for mickb that would quarter best for bowstaves the brethren of the house of the face go forth at the aldermans bidding and find the bride waiting for them we have only room for a portion of the description which is noticeable for its extreme simplicity and directness  so came they to the yewwood and the brethren fell to work and the bride with them for she was deft with the axe and strong withal but at midday they rested on the green slope without the yewwood and they ate bread and flesh and onions and apples and drank red wine of the dale and while they were resting the bride sang to them an ancient song of the coming of the murdercarles no man can tell how many they be and the voice of their host as the thunder rolls the men of a little peaceful settlement hear the true story of the coming danger but determine to defend their home against all the world  it was summertide and the month of hay and men and maids must fare afield but we saw the place where the bowstaves lay and the hall was hung with spear and shield  when the moon was high we drank in the hall and they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe and they said come back when the chestnuts fall and the winecarts wend across the hythe  come oft and oer again they said wander your ways but we abide for all the world in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  yea come in arms if ye will they said and despite your host shall we abide for life or death in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  so she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreading wide before her and a robin came nigh from outof a tbornbush and sung his song also the sweet herald of coming winter and the lapwings wheeled about black and white above the meadow by the river sending forth their wheedling pipe as they i hung above the soft turf there is no space to quote the account of the gathering of the host in burgdale the bowmens battle on the edge of silverdale and the onslaught of the men of the steer the bridge and the bull and all the other banners of the united kindreds the reader will find plenty of homeric fighting with the victory inclining always to the right side the felons are massacred and peace returns to the desolated valleys the kindreds became one folk  for better or worse in peace and

B8569,['6790521'],  1 kifpps the story of a simpie soul art iiinovels with a philosophy by h g wells london macmillan  co 1905 2 the divine fire by may sinclar london constable  co 1904 3 the difficult way by mabel deamer london smith elder  co 1905 4 the garden of allah by robert ehcimhns london methuen  co 1904 mjore than once in this review at least an opinion has been expressed that the novel as a literary form is falling somewhat from its pride of place that its best period closed say before stevensons appearance and that the finest work of the prose imagination shows a drawing towards the compacter less redundant expression to be found in drama yet it must be owned that the novel if indeed it be dying dies hard and that the drama if indeed it be destined to renascence comes feebly and slowly to the birth merely considering literature as a source of amusement we note that in point of fact romances are as popular as ever whether their heroes handle rapier or revolver whether they dominate palace intrigues in france under the valois or in some imaginary principality lying about the balkans but on the stage where is their equivalent melodrama  submerged under a sea of musical comedy driven out by a mob of entertainments in which anything matters but the words even farce is disappearing unless it comes as part of a spectacle yet mr jacobs loses none of his vogueand long may he continue to make us laugh but those of the public who look as we have said to literature simply to be made to laugh to be excited over a story depend more and more on the novel or to be accurate they depend less and less on the play as for the others the intellectual party who not long ago were promised so much from the drama of ideas they poor people have little but disappointment to look back on they were to get plays which would make them think would bring them vividly face to face with the central emotions of modem life and they went with great expectations of the purging by pity and by fear which aristotleand mr walkleyhad taught them to desiderate it was not simple amusing comedy they were looking for mr pinero to do him justice was already giving them that in the happy days when mrs john woods company was playing the magistrate and kindred productions it was not simply moving situations they wanted mr h a jones if one did not look too critically was already achieving those for instance in the scene of the middleman where cyrus blenkarn burns his last sticks of furniture to keep the furnace going for his final experiment what they hoped for and what they were promised was something on a higher intellectual plane something to stay with you to modify your mindas unquestionably ibsen had modified the minds of his countrymen and their kin through scandinavia that was the programme and mr pinero mr jones and the rest were very serious about their mission and their message but unhappily it soon became apparent and increasingly apparent that there was only one matter which these gentlemen cared to think about or make other people think aboutthe interesting but by no means paramount concern of sexual relations and their social bearings if you wished to be harrowed with a tale of lapses matrimonial prematrimonial or extramatrimonial and their allotted punishment the dramatists were ready the rest was silence it appeared that none of the other issues of life were suitable for stage presentation this we repeat was disappointing for those who had expected from the regenerated stage representations of life so arranged as to suggest if not a philosophy at least a novel range of reflections and who had reflected to the point of weariness upon the various situations arising out of breaches of the seventh commandment so it has gone on recent years have seen one comedy of firstrate literary merit full of a farreaching irony achieve a considerable successas successes go but there has been only one admirable crichton and meanwhile mr g b shaw has been for all these years in play after play tossing about ideas as deftly as freely and often almost as aimlessly as a conjurer juggles with balls and the stage and the public have barely noticed his existence nowadays indeed he begins actually to be produced at london theatres and from any point of view but the orthodox theatrical one he is famous but if his talent so ingenious so witty so observant and with all its freakishness so sane had thrown itself into novelwriting who doubts that mr shaw would have been accepted long ago not only by a small number but by a very large public for the public shows no repugnance to ideas so long as they are produced in print indeed it might be argued that the characteristic type of the novel in these days is that which makes its appeal to readers not so much by the story it tells as by the range of ideas which it presents and illustrates mrs humphry ward has strong claims to be regarded as the typically successful novelist of this generation and mrs ward someone said sees men and women as ideas walking true niece of her illustrious uncle she provides each of her heroes and heroines with a complete and logically interdependent system of ideas and the drama in her best novel helbeck of bannisdale is the collision between two such complete and logically interdependent systems this is not to deny that helbeck and lucilla are human beings but if one calls up tom jones and his sophia becky sharp and rawdon crawley clara middleton and sir willoughby and as many more figures as one chooses from the great assembly created by the earlier novelists even by men interested in character rather than in action it will seem clear that their creators value them primarily as human beings whereas mrs wardand in some measure george eliot before heris concerned chiefly with the influence of certain intellectual convictions on the lives of certain human beings being only human herself when it comes to dealing with opinions she does not withhold her adherence from this or that belief she preaches and she teaches explicitly rather than implicitly a philosophy a system of thought detachable from the particular relation in which she presents it and this we contend is increasingly the way of the modem novelist though that way has many variations to illustrate our view we have chosen from the books of this present year two stories that have absolutely nothing in common but merit linking with each a novel of an earlier crop by its natural affinities in the one case of subject in the other of ideas the first of our cases is peculiar it is highly probable that nine readers out of ten will ignore the philosophy which underlies mr wellss admirable novel and to be quite candid that philosophy is not explicit is not even adequately suggested in kipps yet anybody who has read mr wells for the last three or four years and considered his work as a whole will readily concede in the first place that mr wells has a philosophy and in the second that he is in black earnest about it mankind in the making was a desperately serious study of the problem which mr wells presented characteristically by picturing mankind as human beings massed in one great room into which a gigantic spout discharged automatically eight babies per second the question was how to deal with the babies and the supply of babies it is no part of our purpose to criticise his constructive philosophywhich aimed at creating a sort of platonic state governed by a committee of men of sciencefarther than to remark that of all nightmares which mr wellss prolific fancy has brought forth this is by far the most terrifying but consider in the light of that series of grave economic and political essays his extravaganza the food of the gods and its allegoric intention becomes apparent the food of the gods is a chemical preparation invented casually by a man of science which so supplements the waste in tissue that it renders growth continuous instead of jerky and by consequence increases tenfold or thereabouts the development of every living thing treated with it in the first instance rats and other vermin get hold of it and become a scourge but the human beings produced under this treatment are more than a match for gigantic rats they grow so portentously that society endeavours to prohibit the manufacture of the famous food and the end is wara war of a few gullivers against the lilliputians here you have in a figure mr wellss view that if only men of science had a free hand they could alter the race of man and the face of the globe out of all recognition give to your committee of savants first of all a control of marriage so as to ensure a physically and mentally sound offspring then a control of education so that the fruit of these selected unions may be properly brought up and you will very soon have a breed of physical and intellectual giants but for the moment the men of science have no control nature and society pull along together not very equally yoked hampering rather than helping each other and what is the result  the result iskipps mr kipps is produced for our inspection firstly to amuse and interest us but certainly also in order that we may all of us know what the present system does in the way of turning out citizens that we may realise what it means to be bred up in that state of life which naturally prompts a young man to become a drapers apprentice for in truth we are made to feel acutely that mr kipps is a worm and no man that he is socially physically intellectually contemptible and it needed an artist of no common order to convey at the same time that morally kipps is more than respectableto command for him actual liking and sympathy the practical suggestion is just thisthat birth education and the whole fabric of our world have conspired to unfit kipps for any but the meanest uses but that there lie in him possibilities which rationally developed in a sane social order would have made himwell a very goodhearted and courageous little gentleman yet mr wells is too studious of his art to stress his moral careful not to harrow our feelings unduly he prefers to insinuate ideas under the cloak of drollery and above all he is too fond of mr kipps to deal ungently with him we are left to think out for ourselves the gloomier reflections which flow as corollaries from the natural history of this amiable little counterjumper the natural history is contained in the early part of the story which describes kippss education and early career before chance removed him from his normal sphere and set his qualities and endowments in a new light and here mr wells is absolutely relentless let us thank providence that he felt no hankering after realism for a story of kippss life as it would have been lived out barring the sport of fortune which tossed him to the pinnacle of twelve hundred a year would be of all imaginable books the most depressing mr wells is content simply to shadow in the possibility with a few trenchant phrases he finds a humaner and pleasanter way of commenting on mr kippss education by showing how the training which made him readily and without more than common reluctance take the mould of a drapers assistant had also perfectly unfitted him for freedom kipps was an orphan and illegitimate moreover his mother left him to the care of an uncle and aunt who kept a small shop in a southern seaside town the illegitimacy did not greatly matter as his uncle and aunt after the fashion of their class in england kept themselves to themselves and did not willingly associate with their neighbours nevertheless kipps in early boyhood and in school holidays made a momentous friendship with the boy next doorsid pornickand also with ann sids sister mr wells describes with a fine gusto the days of playing pirates along the foreshore somewhere by dungenessdays which were all the more delightful by contrast to school for kipps since he was too well come of to be sent to a board school went to an academy for young gentlemenand it is quite evident that in mr wellss ideal commonwealth no such private adventurers in pedagogy as the head of this institution will be allowed that brief section is written in vitriol as to the resultsonly incidentally does mr wells indicate that kipps retiring from his intellectual trainingground to begin the practical business of life could not read penny novelettes with the same facility as his comrade sid pornick that was at the age of fourteen in that same lucid interspace between school and apprenticeship he  made his first tentative essays at the mysterious shrine of love a race with ann pornick the sight of her flushed face and tossed hair began it sids penny novelettes and sids own declared passion for the rectors daughtera distant goddessinflamed the desire to ave a girl just to talk to and all that and the emotions culminated in a walk with ann and the endeavour to break a sixpence it was ann who accomplished the breaking of the coin in time to hand itas a peace offering after some coolnessto kipps setting out on the bus for folkestone and mr shalfords drapery bazaar kipps when inexorable fate in mr wellss words propelled him towards the distributing branch of the social service was by the nature of his training indistinct in his speech confused in his mind and retreating in his manners had he been so unfortunate as to be born a german mr wells hints he might have been educated in an elaborate and costly special  school to fit him for his end but in a country of robust individualism he was left to be trained in a practical manner by the man who having himself succeeded as a draper should best be fitted to make others succeedin this case mr shalford vitriol again supplies the fluid for the description of this new stage in the training of  an imperial englishman the flesh and blood of the picture has to be left out here but we may quote a passage where the dramatic method is abandonedand where at least the destructive part of mr wellss social philosophy becomes tolerably explicit  the indentures that bound kipps to mr shalford were antique and complex they insisted on the latter gentlemans parental privileges they forbade kipps to dice and game they made him over body and soul to mr shalford for seven long years the crucial years of his life in return there were vague stipulations about teaching the whole art and mystery of the trade to him but as there was no penalty attached to negligence mr shalford being a sound practical business man considered this a mere rhetorical flourish and set himself assiduously to get as much out of kipps and to put as little into him as he could in the seven years of their intercourse what he put into kipps was chiefly bread and margarine infusions of chicory and teadust colonial meat by contract at threepence a pound potatoes by the sack and watered beer if however kipps chose to buy any supplementary material for growth mr shalford had the generosity to place his kitchen resources at his disposal freeif the fire chanced to be going he was also allowed to share a bedroom with eight other young men and to sleep in a bed which except in very severe weather could be made with the help of his overcoat and private underlinen not to mention newspapers quite sufficiently warm for any reasonable soul in addition kipps was taught the list of fines and how to tie up parcels to know where goods were kept in mr shalfords systematised shop to hold his hands extended upon the counter and to repeat such phrases as  what can i have the pleasure  no trouble i ssure you  and the like to block fold and measure materials of all sorts to lift his hat from his head when he passed mr shalford abroad and to practice a servile obedience to a large number of people but he was not of course taught the  cost mark of the goods he sold nor anything of the method of buying such goods nor was his attention directed to the unfamiliar social habits and fashions to which his trade ministered the use of half the goods he saw sold and was presently to assist in selling he did not understand materials for hangings cretonnes chintzes and the like serviettes and all the bright hard whitewear of a wellordered house pleasant dressmaterials linings stiffenings they were to him from first to last no more than things heavy and difficult to handle in bulk that one folded up unfolded cut into lengths and saw dwindle and pass away into that mysterious happy world in which the customer dwells kipps hurried from piling linen tablecloths that were collectively as heavy as lead to eat off oilcloth in a gaslit diningroom underground and he dreamed of combing endless blankets beneath his overcoat spare undershirt and three newspapers so he had at least the chance of learning the bleginnings of philosophy two sentences may be extracted from the detailed description of the servitude in which kipps found himself his work began at 630 am and rarely much later than nine a supper of bread and cheese and watered beer awaited him downstairs and that consumed the rest of the day was entirely at his disposal for reading recreation and the improvement of his mind    the front door was locked at halfpast ten and the gas in the dormitory extinguished at eleven as promotion occurred kipps became so much less of a slave that he had apprentices under him and might cuff them but it is to be feared that in mr wellss judgment even carshot and buggins the chief shopwalkers were not absolutely free men the deeper aspects of the question are presented to kipps by a refractory apprentice  when you get too old to work they chuck you away said minton  lor  you find old drapers everywheretramps beggars docklabourers busconductorsquod anywhere but in a crib dont they get shops of their own   lord  ow are they to get shops of their own  they avent any capital  hows a drapers shopman to save up five hundred pounds even  i tell you it cant be done you got to stick t6 cribs until its over i tell you were in a blessed drainpipe and weve got to crawl along it till we die  all the misery of the business is presented by mr wells only in the beginning while kipps was still raw dimly he perceived the thing that had happened to him how the great stupid machine of retail trade had caught his life into its wheels a vast irresistible force which he had neither strength of will nor knowledge to escape this was to be his life until his days should end no adventures no glory no change no freedom when he went home for his first holidays mr shalford allowed ten days in the year sid and ann had vanishedthey also caught he had a brief moment of despair but no revolt and thenhere mr wells shows his geniussuffering ceased kipps settled down into his position one sectionthe lastsection of the preliminary part of the bookis devoted to the distractions of his adolescence the love affairs of the drapers shopaneemic paltry flirtations engagements which as mr wells explains are essentially more refined less coarsely practical and altogether less binding than the engagements of the vulgar rich puerile silly ineffectual paddling where it is decreed that men  must sink or swim perhaps on the whole it is only an exceptionally careless reader who will not realise that mr wells is intimating some dissatisfaction with the existing order such a life as kipps is living is no life for a man even mr kipps himself realises the narrowness of his cage and by reason of the spark unsubdued yet unsuspected that is in him he cranes over the edge till he topples over out of his allotted place the day comes when he falls in love in other wise than in any of his six engagements here is the history some vague desire for selfimprovement took him to a woodcarving class on the thursday evenings mr shalford had been impelled to fall in with an early closing movement and at the carving class miss helen walsingham presided she was beautiful and her conversation upon general subjects with friends of hers who frequented the room filled kipps with an abysmal sense of his own inferiority for a series of evenings he adored living from one thursday to the next and miss walsingham was conscious of his adoration as a droll and not unpleasing fact then the classes ended and with their ending comes the transition to humorous extravaganza on the first vacant thursday kipps moodily pondering suicide collides with a bicyclist who in making compensation by lavish hospitality announced himself as an unacted dramatist kipps in his genial company gets drunk spends the night out and next morning is dismissed by mr shalford a few pages suggest grimly though vaguely the process of  cribhunting but worse than the uncertainty of employment is the prospect of exile from folkestone and the carving class then upon kipps in his blackest despair mr chitterlow the dramatist descended with an advertisement inquiring for arthur kipps five days later mr kipps was in the possession of a fortune and after a reasonable interval engaged to miss helen walsingham here is where the analogy with miss sinclairs book comes in the divine fire records also the history of a young man who loves out of his class but miss sinclair can hardly be accused of a philosophy her task has been to reconcile readers to a hero without aitches savage keith rickman is a poeta poet indubitable triumphant accepted straight oif by those who know more than that physically a fine specimen of young manhood and under no embarrassment in his relations with the ladies who share his boarding house or even with miss poppy grace of a celebrated musichall but confronted with a lady who inherits money culture and everything else in a concatenanation accordingly he becomes like mr kipps retreating in his  manners like mr kipps terribly embarrassed with a teacup and in moments of emotion he is liable to drop an aspirateworse still to know that he has dropped it miss sinclair does not challenge the accepted code she gives their full and appalling significance tothese trifles literally light as airthese breathings more or less to make up for mr rickmans omissions she endows him with a quixotism that would be almost preposterous were he not a poet and she is careful to delay his final triumph till the english tongue has no longer any pitfalls for him at the same time she is careful to guard her heroine lucilla from the reproach of any unheroic insistence on social qualifications influences are constantly at work which display mr rickman in a false light but essentially miss sinclair conforms rickman with good looks education and the assured success of a genius which imposes itself by sheer mastery is nevertheless all but impossible as a mate for the finely bred lady because of social inexperience and a trick of speech that society has chosen out for a special stigma mr wells on the other hand is by implication a challenger of convention kipps in his shopman period is a person with whom helen can shake hands across the counterto show her largeness of mind kipps with twelve hundred a year is a person whom helens relations regard as a suitable match for her with twelve thousand or thirty thousand or a hundred thousand a yearthe precise figure does not matterhe would be regarded as a suitable match for a lady of miss lucilla hardens standing miss sinclair would doubtless declare that no amount of money would induce lucilla to overlook deficient aitches but miss sinclair is obliged to provide her aitchless hero with what is as rare even as the possession of a million or two and in certain societies carries as much distinction the supreme literary gift she as we have said is conformist and practically accepts the principles that certain purely formal defects mi education should constitute between a man who is liable to them and a woman who is not a gulf which only some portentous accident can bridge over whereas mr wells is evidently of opinion that the whole framework of society is absurdly adjusted as anybody can see from the case of mr kipps kipps is a person artificially made vulgar with a mind that has acquired nothing but vulgar ideas because none but vulgar ideas were ever put into it yet possessing in his own nature springs of generosity and chivalry and high aspirations after honour the beautiful helen is a person cultivated up to the limit of her capacity conscious that nothing but the lack of larger financial means debars her from a distinguished social success and therefore willing to accept mr kipps and his income as a means to the way of life that she desires confiding in her own ability to make even of kipps something not wholly discreditable intellectually kipps is dominated by his surroundings all the guidance in his mind teaches him that in marrying helen he is on the way to undreamed promotion if he is saved he has to thank his instincts for from the moment of his engagement helen has no charm for him but instinct has a tough battle and without the vigorous help of ann pornick it would certainly not have won even so after kipps and ann have eloped from the very scene of his detested splendouror rather from the kitchen below the diningroom which was the arena of his social ordealthe influence of helen and her circle still makes itself felt kipps continues to try to impose upon ann the standards of behaviour which they laboured to instil into him nature does not triumph over vulgarity till helens brother has made away with kippas fortune and left him and ann free and happy in a rational existence in the earlier days of their union it seems as though the whole social order conspired against themmore especially in the persons of house agents and architects against whom mr wells frames a venomous indictment the kippses cannot manage to live as they want to live they must live as is expected of people with twelve hundred a year ann the wholly untutored contends for common sense but kipps still has hankerings after the proper thing and there is a scene of true pathos where ann is left crying beside the uneaten buttered toast because kipps has banged the door in disgust on learning that she had denied herself to the visit of the local dean and his wife it would be grossly unfair to call mr wellss very delightful and humorous story a tractate on education but nevertheless there is hardly a page of it which does not bear evidence of the authors central concern mr wells does not mean to imply that money is a bad thing but surely he does imply that it is a bad thing to train a young man so that he cannot use the opportunities which a command of money offers he does not assert that shopkeeping is a degrading occupationon the contrary he grows lyrical over the charms of owning a drapers shop but he does emphasise the degrading effect of service in a shop conducted like mr shalfords and he certainly does not regard mr shalford as an exception and at the back of it all nowhere expressed but everywhere implied is an angry even a bitter assertion that the foundation of any rational social order ought to be selfrespect while the foundation of the social order under which imperial englishmen like mr kipps exist is servile veneration for something which they cannot be it is a far cry from mr wells and  kipps to mrs dearmer and the difficult wayfarther still to mr hichens and the garden of allah yet there is just this in common to the three books each ends as a novel should end on a sense of stable equilibrium something is settled for good and all in a life or lives kipps at the last end discovers himself and that is the end of education to that point also mrs dearmer and mr hichens have to bring their chief charactersand the chief figure of each book is a woman let us first sketch mrs dearmers it begins where so many novels leave off with a marriage nan the art student marries the reverend john pilgrim and goes to share his poverty in a south london cure of souls but nan has no concern with the souls frankly pagan she regards love as the whole of existence and her single object is to squander happiness on her husbandto pamper him with love in the moments when he is free from work which she regards as irrelevant and alien in other ways too she is bent to pamper him he has no sense of what things cost and though bills accumulate he guesses nothing and she determines to monopolise this trouble so the seed of tragedy is sown springing out of kind intentions pilgrim forbids his wife to try to earn money holding that if she wishes to work her energies should go to the parish and she cannot explain to him her need of money without betraying what she chooses to keep from him she prefers to attempt earning without his knowledge and so concealment begins her first essay is at selling her verses but this fails then when creditors grow importunate she has the inspiration of offering to sit as a model to roger wentworth her comrade of artstudent daysand though she does not dream of it her lover thus between the two lie growing reticences john pilgrim is only half convinced by his wise old friend and hers father peter that it is better not to force religion on nan but to trust her love to work out its own salvation while nan on her side has her secrets and the link between them reduces itself almost to bare passion john pilgrim is more and more conscious that his wife forces him to a choice between her and the whole tenor of his life that she does indeed make his happiness and his misery and the sense of his abasement is keen when he discovers lighting by chance on a letter from some editor respecting the verses she has tried to sell that she deceives him for that once father peter can console him by explaining that nans object has been to earn money not for luxuries but for his food and a flaming scene follows when there seems a new beginning a new marriage for husband and wife yet even in that moment a light word bears in upon john pilgrim how precarious is his happiness how he holds nan and her warm beauty  precariously  and by the connivance as it were of death a memorable phrase surely that mrs dearmer has created and even in that moment nan eager to unbosom herself to the utmost sees her husbands face wan and withholds from him the truth of her sitting to roger lest he should refuse to allow these earnings to continue there is nothing in the book more pathetic than the suggestion of the girls misguided selfmartyrdom her unutterable longing for the peace of full understanding her impulse to give up the whole game and thenthe sound of her husbands coughing fit that checks her on the very brink of explanation the tragedy bursts full of course when the time comes and some busy lady in the parish writes the lamentable result of her observations john pilgrim forgets that he has already misjudged his wife and only remembers that she has already deceived him secret now as herself he tracks her to roger wentworths door and nan returns radiant from the last but one of her sittings her hands full of primroses and wallflowers to find a very madman before her for disease has conspired with jealousy to work its will on the man that night nan spends in the passage beating till she is worn out at the locked door of her husbands room and in the endless hours her soul goes down into torment her husband has ceased to love her what was physical pain to this  softnessease yet here in this purging by fiery torment was the beginning of triumph mrs dearmers philosophy is a glorification of the uses of pain she would say we fancy that her nan had always shrunk from painpain to herself the pain which she most dreaded the pain of fear for her husbands health yet had always conceived of herself as shrinking from giving pain to her husband now her discipline is by scourging until the very faculty to feel is,folklore_contra

to be grateful for we are given the fourth edition and the first with a list of variations between the second third and fourth versions the form is pretty and convenient but in a popular edition we should like something more we are not al members of the omar club we cannot read all the books that have dealt with the persian original nor follow through many volumes the lore that would tell us how far fitzgerald tampered with his model a short summary of the results of recent research should have been prefixed and save in the editors note there is no mention of fitzgerald at all i yet the book in its cheap form will fall into new hands quite outside the wellinformed literary circles doubtless it reflects too closely the latent philosophy of the day not to be received with profound interest

series of pictures illustrative of the campaign the  basis of observation  is in the main quite sound and to all admirers of the russian painter his notes must be deeply interesting even nonadmirers will find them graphic and terse verestchagin has made a great impression on the english mind because he is a painter with a declared obvious consistent purpose that it is not directly an artistic purpose is all the better for his repute among us he is a vigorous moralist a striking personality mr whiteing would have been better employed in emphasising that than in making claims for him as an artist that cannot for a moment be upheld on the artistic side he is far from despicable but for all his distinction as a man he is not one of the eminent painters of europe and to treat him as a pioneer in realism is absurd  rubaiyat of omar khayyam english french german italian and danish translations comparatively arranged in accordance with the text of edward fitzgeralds versions edited by nathan haskell dole 2 vols boston us page london macmillan  co the stanzas of omar khayyam translated from the persiau by john leslie garner second edition bell  sons it is as difficult to retrace in native biography the true personality of the arab persian or central asiatic writer who has earned high distinction among eastern poets as it is to certify which of the detached pieces attributed to him are really his own and the case of omar khayyam of nishapur supplies no exception to the rule fortunately for the reputation of this particular bard there has risen at the present day a new generation of english orientalists distinguished by thoroughness of performance as well as fullness of promise who seem bent on giving us on his behalf something more than a patchwork portrait or such frontispiece to his writings as would satisfy the ordinary and unexacting western critic enlightened and encouraged on one side by the research of russian savants and on the other by though enterprise of american publishers they carry on their labours with a sober enthusiasm and quiet tenacity of purpose which cannot fail to bear good fruit so that almost before the close of the passing century we may reasonably expect to know as much of the old tentmaker as we do of his contemporaries under the angevin rulers in england readers of the royal asiatic societys journal will be at no loss to recognise the more notable workers in a scantily peopled field in mr nathan haskell doles fairly exhaustive compilation the reader must not expect to find necessarily much new light or new matter it is practically a summary of translations and paraphrases with variations of the rhymed reflections of that now famous persian thinker of the twelfth century the success of whose remarkable quatrains

hitherto been applied to them there is much of interest in the notes essays and reviews by which the anglicised or europeanized verse is accompanied but any analysis of papers mostly printed years ago would be manifestly out of place at the present time and we may content ourselves with congratulating the able compiler on the value of his reproductions and the uses he has made of them if we venture to take exception to the assertion that thanks to the attention bestowed upon his writings by modern european critics  old omar stands clearly outlined before our vision and that  if he should teappear in our day it would be as a leader of modern thought we do so under the impression that notwithstanding all that has been said and conjectured about him we have not yet attained to a full appreciation of his already published writings moreover the notion of his reappearance amongst us as a successful uptodate teacher implies a certain experience of the later world which could hardly be acquired by intuition and which even an omar khayyam could not afford to ignore the section described as  comparative versions of the rubaiyat constitutes fitzgerald a kind of fugleman to the corps of translatorsthat is to say his rendering of the supposed original leads the way and gives as it were the cue to others but as might have been anticipated the position is not maintained fitzgeralds genius was never trammelled by adherence to a rigid text and it soon becomes apparent that each expositor abandoning his imaginative and erratic leader follows out his own method of interpreting the persian manuscript in the order prescribed for this particular set of quatrains come nicolas mccarthy korney whinfield garner bodenstedt and graf von schnell elsewhere we search for and discover with specimen extracts keene pickering whitley stokes prof cowell and a host of others more or less qualified as exponents of though chosen theme the editor deserves our warmest thanks for the prominence given to the retrospect of prof cowells labours more especially for republishing that eminent scholars contribution to vol xxx of the calcutta review it is pleasant to recall how favourable and yet well poised is the professors estimate of the author of the rubaiyat as shown in the following extract  we find some excuse for his errors if we remember though state of the world at that time his clear strong sense revolted from the prevailing mysticism where all the earnest spirits of the age found their refuge and his honest independence was equally shocked by the hypocrites who aped their fervour and enthusiasm and at that dark hour of mans history whither out of islam was the thoughtful mohammedan to repair  no missionarys step bringing good tidings had appeared on the mountains of persia  the few christians who might cross his path in his native land would only seem to him idolaterschristianity came before omar only in the form of the first crusade unless oriental chronology is hopelessly misleading in regard to local history this must indeed have been about the period in which omar khayyam flourished and it is probable that the crusaders made their victorious entry into jerusalem under godfrey de bouillon shortly before his death though we have no evidence to affirm that he took the same exalted view of christianity as his religious brother and predecessor albiruni who spoke of its tenets with an admiration quite exceptional in the case of a votary of islam he could for the occasion pray with his fellowmen not only outside the precincts of the mosque but without the aid of a mohammedan spiritual guide his pen thus bears testimony on the subject wanting the rose the thorn well might avail wanting the day i make dark night avail wanting praise prayer and sheikh prescribd by rule i make church bells and christian rite avail and now before closing our brief notice of mr doles compilation we may appropriately take note of some three or four rubaiyat significant of a higherclass omar much has been said of our astronomerpoets freethinking his cynicism his restless allusions to an unalterable destiny but in how few of his stanzas have his warmest admirers or most sympathetic interpreters attempted to bring out an underlying christian spirit which is by no means quite occult or to be sought for only between the lines of his verse surely the two following quatrains taken from whinfields translation possess a sufficient flavour of christianity to acquit their author of any wholesale charge of irreligion or infidelity  whateer thou doest never grieve thy brother nor kindle fumes of wrath his peace to smother dost thou desire to taste eternal bliss vex thine own heart but never vex another  today is thine to spend but not tomorrow  counting on morrows

original and which are excellent enough to go beyond the second edition now published retain fairly the metre and meaning of the persian but translators like doctors disagree and this disagreement is often evident in small things for instance in lines breathing the same spirit as those last quotod we find according to mr garner the mosque the kaba tis a prison cell a chain the chimes that from the steeple swell the rosary the mehrab and the church are like the cross all signs of slavery fell according to mr whinfield the lines are thus rendered in english  pagodas just as mosques are homes ot prayer fis prayer that church bells chime into the air  yes church and kaba rosary and cross are all but diverse tongues of worldwide prater the word bandagi used three times in though original and anglicised the same number of times by prayer is here a service of worship without relation to imprisonment chains or any outward sign of slavery mr whinfields footnote affirming that the meaning

to the time of his death  so much as left for many weeks together the shelter of his paternal roof only for a couple of years before he entered his teens does he seem to have attended even a dayschool yet his work exhibits a lively negative to the saw that homekeeping youths have ever homely wits  and whether we examine his extraordinary juvenile watercolours or study the romances into which more than into his paintings he threw inherited  qualities of prompt solid realistic invention and dramatic force and directness it is impossible to help marvelling at the breadth of his observation the

tale may have resolved to forsake the brush from other motives than  some restive idiosyncrasy  forbidding him  to tread the paternal vestiges perhaps he felt a constraining sense that the canvas

the readableness of the third hebditchs legacy though we do not think it as clearlydrawn or as attractive this may be due to a more tangled plot and more shadowy characters perhaps too chambers in

prose and poetry to assure us that had his life not been cut short in its very flower he would have poured forth richer and more perfect fruit of a rare and teeming fancy even the delirium stage of

and f hueffer with a memoir 2 vols tinsley brothers nothing is sadder than to find that the first fruits of early geniusas yet but half matured are the last results we shall ever get yet this will often happen the imagination so soon excited the nerves so highly strung are at once the cause of the promise in the present and of its nonfulfilment in the future the strain has been too great the sword has been too sharp no recent instance illustrates this so strongly as the brief memoir and fragmentary stories that messrs tinsley have published it was in the autumn of 1873 that a strangelooking book of a livid yellow binding with black figures of a burning ship and wreathing smoke and gnawing rats stamped upon the back appeared before the world it was easy for the critics to discern power in its graphic descriptions and in its vigorous language and to this j ustice was done but on the other hand there was a horrible plot and an exaggerated tone which at times became almost grotesque so that the impression finally left was one of repulsion and distaste for few of the readers of the tale were not aware that its author was still a boy and that  gabriel denver was written when oliver madoxbrown was but seventeen years of age had they known this the feeling of wonder and of hope would have been stronger than any other the volumes before us contain the first version of gabriel denver which bore originally the picturesque name of the black swan a name which the publishers with the same stupidity that insisted on altering hawthornes the marble faun into transformation changed into the present commonplace title the same unhappy influence also weakened the story itself by changing the jealous wife into a lover and by giving to the hideous plot an inartistically happy end of the memoir with which the volumes open there is nothing good to say two editors might between them one would think have given a sketch of this gifted boy which would have impressed itself on the memory as it is there are in all but twenty pages and of these about a third are with questionable taste taken up with the prattlings of his childhood and the ravings of his last delirium did he write no letters that might be quoted1 is nothing of his conversation when in health remembered 1 some memorial lines alone by mr philip marston which in their pathetic beauty recall cowleys elegy on mr william harvey seem to convey to us an idea of what oliver madoxbrown really was for the rest we have the barest facts he was born in 1855 when he was eight he began to paint in watercolour in 18g0 when only fourteen he was an exhibitor at the dudley gallery in 1871 he exhibited at the new british institution and in the winter of that year he turned his brush into a pen and wrote the black swan there came some unfinished romances which are here presented to the world and thenthe end in 1874 the poor boy died his brain active to the last still planning new stories or visited by strange visions of the stories before us the fragmentit is only a fragmentcalled  the dwale bluth  a local name for the deadly nightshade is decidedly the finest there is something about it which reminds us of the brontesbut of emily rather than of charlotte this resemblance which seems also to have struck mr marston is chiefly in the character of the incidents and the description of scenery while a certain introspective glance a certain mode of tracing out subtle analogies between the outer life of nature and the inner life of man recalls the still greater name of the famous american romancewriter the very way in which the dwale bluth clings to the hair and poisons the wearer seems to show its relationship to the flowers in rappaccinis garden or among zenobias tresses or by the grave which septimius had dug the story flows clearly along till the end of helens childhood then there i3 apparently a gap and although some other chapters are carefully written and highly finished they do not piece so readily with the first part and after all the tale remains unfinished the faults of the dwale bluth are scarcely noticeable among its rare merits but there is certainly at times an overelaboration in details and the reader might have been spared the unintelligible dialect of devonshire which requires a constant footnote of translation and which therefore adds nothing to the true colouring of the picture on the other hand what power there is in every page what imagination and at times what humour the early history of the serpletons the squire and his gypsy wife the parson with his knowledge of books and his ignorance of all besides the little halfgipsy helenall this is described with a precision and force that call up again unavailing regrets for what this wonderful literary faculty might hereafter have produced no extracts can in the least do justice to the impression which the entire story leaves upon the reader and the following are given only as showing something of the style and spirit in which the work is written   in the autumn examined from the bridlepaths across the distant heights serpleton house but for its pointed gables and the thin wreaths of smoke from its chimneysmight have been taken for one of those huge white fragments of rock with which the northern heights of dartmoor are strewn so wildly projecting from the hillside in a profusion of purple heather and golden furzeblossom in the spring the ancient appletrees along its unenclosed orchards grew radiant in the windy sunlight under the blue sky among the purple cloud  shadows but in the winter with the keen boisterous east wind heavy with mist and sleet driving across the sterile moorlands and whistling harshly through its crevices turning its chimneys and corridors into a monstrous series of organpipes and playirjg sinister tunes on themserpleton house must have looked dreary indeed for a human dwellingplace or take thisthe wild little helen who had once seen the dwale bluth before and was always by some mysterious fascination longing for it goes one day into the deserted garden and rests on the edge of a broken cucumberframe  of a sudden she started and leaned over the broken bars there was what she had been looking after for her downcast eyes fell with an instantaneous revival of interest on the tendrils of the deadly nightshade loaded with poison flowers and berries crawling stealthily round the inside of the frame or crouching ignominiously along the damp ground the traces of snailtracks went all over the bricks and mould and the leaves were bitten here and there but it was singular to note what a number of empty snailshells were lying among its foliage in spite of this it had grown into a goodly plant the dwale bluth is a cowardly creeper and knows no means of rising above the earth it springs from unless by insinuating itself among the leaves of some bolder parasite there it now lay beneath her gaze even throwing a grim and sinister reflection on to her darkcomplexioned face and into her eyes  there it lay at her feet prone and helpless as though it were entreating her to life it how strangely artistic is the touch which marvels at the empty snailshells though the plant was vigorous   hebditchs legacy is still more incomplete than the  dwale bluth and is less easy to follow it would probably have been as weird though not so picturesque a story and there are some of the finest isolated passages in it that can be found among all these fragments the description of the fog in the dying womans room with which  hebditchs legacy opens is hardly inferior to the stormscene in the other tale a curious instance only slightly more marked than many others of the way in which the trained perception of the painter could give reality to the writers scene occurs towards the end of this tale  but facing each other as the uncle and nephew were mr blackoder still had the advantage for he sat with his back to the light and his face was indistinguishable the only features really visible in it were the eyes which witching perhaps the dim reflection of the great silver ipergne glowed under their overhanging brows with a keen motionless gleam of the shorter stories and of the poems there is not much to say they show the writers versatility but they do not show him at his best still for one wild fragment we must find place it is obscure no doubt but it has a something of the ballad ring about it these tracies were descended from one of the murderers of beckett and so woe to the unborn aeons of the

was taken from the world by this boys early death of course it is possible that as years passed a genius which was developed so soon might have faded away in the common light of every day but if it had grown with his growth oliver madoxbrown must have taken rank with the great masters of romance as it is we have only these broken remains and this totally inadequate memoir for the first there is now no help but as regards the second it is not too late to hope that the editors will give us such a life as may have both a psychological and a literary value,folklore_contra

cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet novel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to

us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the

B7784,['8581915'],  angela pisani angela pisani by the late hon eorge sydney smythe sever viscount strangford bentleys 1875 to those to whom george smythe is anytbhi a than the name of one who for a brief space filled an am portant place in both the social and political history of the day the publication of angela pisani is a matter of interest as wel as of satisfaction to him is due the highet praise which can be awarded to a man that those who knew him best loved him most whilst those who had eves the privilege of knowing him but slightly could not fail to be attracted by his quick sympathetic and sensitive nature by means of which he was able to enter at once into the mood of his companions and frequently to ex press better than themselves what was uppermost in their minds he was in fact possessed of that rare talent of identifying himself with the feelings of others that en of all ranks and opinions were instinctively drawn to wards him and allowed themselves to be moulded and guided by his supple mind the short memoir of his career which lady sirangford prefixes to the novel is a grateful tribute to his memory and shows the admira tion and affection with which his family regarded him if we have a fault to find wvith the editor it is that she has spoken so apologetically as it seems to us of one who might well have been spoken of at this distance of time with pride but what is said is so full of tact and grace and in such harmony with her subject that it would be ungracious to quarrel with what is left unsaid nevertheless we regret that scarcely any allusion is made to mir george smythes connexion with the mlorning chronicle nor any quotations given from the many brilliant articles which he wrote for that journal his career too in the house of commons might have been treated with greater fumness and the influence of his generous temper and persuasive speaking more strongly insisted upon we rather take exception at his editors estimate of george smythes oratorical powers which when roused by a sympathetic topic were at least on a level with those of even the practised speakers of his time take for instance his speech in the session of 1853 on the bill for the removal of roman catholic disabilities which for real eloquence was not surpassed in the debate nor perhaps in the session whilst it gives a far deeper insight into the tendencies of the political school of which the original of  henry coningsby  was a leader than did many of his more purely partisan declarations mr smythe protestedagainst lord john russells bill as one of sham pains and sham penalties against a sham aggression he ridiculed the fol of legislating against spiritual faculties and pro phe sied for the church whether of rome or engad a regenerating mission when one or the other should have celebrated the free nuptials of mo dern liberty and ancient faith the alliance between rome and the socialist element of modern civili5atioet is perhaps already signed and although we wholly dissent from mir smythes views th at such an allianse will be for the welfare of mankind we are ready to admit that it offers the best chance of support to the church those who care to learn more of mr smythes strikingly versatile character cannot do better than to study the character of lioniel daveranche in the work before us it is in no way an autobiography and yet the author in common withalfred de musset to whose eiample he owes so much and of whose influence he is apparent so unconscious cannot like goethe dissociate him ebl at a given moment from his own creations like h french contemporary lie was too eager to prove that ble existed by himself and owed his position to do 0onb favour he could not allow time to ripen his mind o wished to show to the world that his genius could beur once both flower and fruit he was not one of those whom study could save from becoming the prey of b passions and thus we see both in lionel and ild the author of angela pisani a man who at times so0ff ss life but only does so from weariness of spiritwkn what he would call the moment of la jesnee 9ax66 bh passed and when it is no longer spent in the midst of a passionate delirium it is time however to turn from the author to his work which as an unfinished study it is scarcely fair to submit to the ordinary method of criticism lady strangfords tender regard for her relative has perhaps induced her to give to the world more than be would have done for it is difficult to imagine that a man of taste and literary skill as lord strangford has shown himself would have permitted 4 angela pisani to have been published in its present form it is rather the lines upon which the novel was to be constructed than a finished work of art many of the episodes which are introduced bear no relation to the main story and others only arrest the readers interest shortly the plan of the novel seems to have been to contrast the decay of the heroic and chivalrous element of society with the successful progress of the practical and rotwriwr of the former lionel daveranche is the type charles denain of the latter from their first start in school life the weaker and warmer nature is bound to and fascinated by the colder and the cynical throughout their respective careers the same moral is constantly obtruded lionel cannot succeed without the help and advice of the very man whose counsels are daily debasing him to the others level denain on the other band is able to wound his friends pride to betray his trust and to rob him of all that he most loves and yet never to lose his influence over him nor until the last to goad him to attempt revenge in the contrast of these two characters which runs throughout the book the whole interest of the story lies the episode of lionels love for illyrine de la valwhom his pride or his conceit will not permit him to marryis the most powerfully written part of the work if we except a subsequent scene when after having forsaken lionel illyrine returns to him and is in her turn forsaken for angela pisani the character of illyrine is carefully drawn and its deep rich colours is filled in with a masterhand although if judged by the standard of the novels of the present day we should be inclined to add that there is a want of true delicate analysis of character to which we have now become accustomed in real depth of passion however illyrine de la val is far superior to the heroines of the novels of the time at which lord strangford was writing those were the days of tancred  paul clifford and g p r james when the melodramatically impossible alternated with the intolerably tedious and no doubt the author of the present work correctly estimated the taste of his time in forbearing to publish a work which shows more of the analytical method of the french school of the novelists of louis phillippes reign than would have suited the popular english taste of twenty years ago we have not alluded to the plot of the story contained in these volumes for in reality it can hardly be compressed into a short space without spoiling the readers interest and moreover the plot is in itself altogether subordinate to the treatment of the four principal charactersaveranche and denain illyrine and angela this last who gives her name to the entire work plays but a secondary and somewhat insignificant role in the story and would seem to have been introduced to illustrate and support some of stendhals admirable paradoxes relative to the causes which excite and allay passion in both men and women rather than to be the centre round which the interest clings angelas own character indeed has little but its childlike simplicity to attract but she manages by turns to attract to herself in the various phases of amourpique and amourpansion the two heroes of the novel womanlike she is the cause of separation between the two who having been associates thought themselves friends and like many a woman she remains true to the one who wronged her most and accepts almost as her due the passionate devotion of the other who gives up all that life had most attractive to offer in order to tend her as a brother but there is in these volumes much beyond the story of the loves of averanche and denain and their careers in life the subordinate characters of almeric locrt i a cavalier of the king of malatesta pisani a member of the society known as the  children of hate are sketched with care and although the latter is somewhat too melodramatic for our soberer tastes it would not have been out of place at a time when the late bulwer was edifying the world of novel readers with the careers of romantic highwaymen and aesthetic murderers of far higher value are the historical sketches of napoleon prince metternich and louis xviii as an exile in england and the various conversations of mr oakworth the lancashire millowner who may stand for sir robert peel and frank dudley who has some of the qualities of lord george bentinck the social life of the period is brilliantly depicted and the political questions of the day discussed from that lofty eminence on which the young england party had thought fit to seat itself there is moreover much to be gathered from these pages both as a glimpse of the past and a help to what may yet be the future of a party which if it could find a leader who would breathe fresh fire and enthusiasm into its creed might yet be tempted to follow out the old tory creed of pitt and his bolder colleagues and who would attempt that hitherto unattained object of the partythe alliance of the aristocracy and the artisans against the philistine tendencies of the middle classes to such as care for a study of bygone times and old moods of thought for the discussion of political questions which to the last generation seemed vital and the anatomy of the passions we can promise a real enjoyment in angela

tragic though moral is biaoneil forth with a fearful vivid nesslike the hash of lightning felt through the closed the wilfully closed eyelids it tells distinctly to even the deafened ear of the

woe that must terininate cither in despair or death hut to enter more into particulars we must tell the reader that the  victims of society are rather the vic tims of some of the errors that seem to be inseparable from it highly civilised society maybe compared to a rich soil and which if it were not rich could not produce so many goodly flowers and fruits  but this very richness will and must foster into a most rampant luxuriance all poisonbearing weeds to repress if they cannot wholly eradicate the latter is the office of the divine the legislator and the moralist society itself is not to

leo tolstoy 18261910 preacher in him who took such charge of his later years was already casting a shadow over the artistwriter of  anna karenina there is even an indication of the moralist in the last part of that tremendous novel  war and peace about his work in fact is an ever present sense of spiritual duality it is a battlefield on which we watch the ebb and flow of unending conflict the throb and stress of a gigantic disharmony explanation of this mysterious duality must be left to the doctors now that our personalities are controlled by our glands so that if we have plenty of pituitary we are artists and too little adrenalis it  moralists  in choosing a single novel to label with those words so dear to the confectioners of symposiums  the greatest ever written i would select  war and peace in it tolstoy rides two themes like a circus rider on his two piebald horses and by a miracle reaches the stable door still mounted and still whole the secret of his triumph lies in the sheer interest with which his creative energy has invested every passage the book is six times as long as an ordinary novel but it never flags never wearies the reader and the ground  introduction to  anna karenina in the centenary sedition of tolstoys works which is to be published by the oxford university press of human interest and historical event of social life and national lifecovered in it is prodigious a little but not much behind that masterwork comes  anna karenina also of stupendous length this novel contains in the old prince in his daughter kitty in stepan arkadyevich vronsky levin and anna herself six of tolstoys most striking characters he never drew a better portrait than that of stepan arkadvevichthe perfect russian man of the world the writer of this preface has known the very spit of him the opening chapters describing him at an unkind moment in his fortunes are inimitable as for the portrait of annas husband alexev alexandrovichit inspires in us the feelings that he must have inspired in anna the early parts of this great novel are the best for i have never been convinced that anna in the circumstances shown would have committed suicide it is as if tolstoy had drawn her for us with such colour and solidity in the beginning that we cannot believe she is not in the end dismissed by him rather than by herself anna in fact is a warm pulsating person with too much vitality to go out as she did the finish strikes one as vonu as if the creator had turned against his creature and one forms aislya aad nikila scene from tolstoys play the power of darkness the opinion that tolstoy started on this book with the free hand of an unlimited sympathy and understanding but during the years that passed before he finished it became subtly changed in his outlook over life and ended in fact a preacher who had set out an artist it is however no uncommon flaw in writers to misjudge the vitality of their own creations an illustration of the

spaces and leaves little to the imagination but with such vigour such fresh ness that it is all interesting his style in the narrow sense is by no means remarkable all his work bears the impress of a mind more concerned with the thing said than with the way to say it but if one may add to interminable definitions style is the power in a writer to remove all barriers between himself and his reader  the t r i u m p h of style is the creation of intimacy then though such a definition will put many out of court it will leave tolstoy a stylist for no author in h i s storytelling produces a more i n

effort to prove that what he himself felt and saw was what the average man could feel and see and in all this long attempt we are conscious of the distortion which comes when an artist and thinker

knocked over the vase in the hotel till the final moment when she stood looking at her old london home dreaming of the town of freiburg where she will see her lover and whee she will bear his child the portrait of norah and the speed and assurance of the narrative carry us straight through the book excited and unquestioning it is od1y when the last chapter has ended and the spell has waned a little that the power to criticise returns and we begin to feel that we have been hypuotised the plot is commonplce norahs mastery of the technique of business is quite miraculously rapidsavouring

mind long after the book has been put by these scenes rise in a crescendo of peaks out of the novels slow ascent to its climax for here is a novel architecturally conceived its material all purposefully assembled towards the required end high summer opens in the black forestthose sombre mountains in the poetic south of germanyand it is in this section that the poet perhaps not altogether fortunately seems to predominate over the novelist the picture painted is so vivid that the absence of any such sensuous background in the consequent sections tends to leave the reader rather high and dryafter an excursion so vivid it is necessarily some time before he gets accustomed to the barren landscape against which for very bareness of background he is intended ultimately to realise the clearer the movements of the several characters that inhabit it it is in fact too great a stride from the pagan beauty of the mountains to the ironic fatuities of life in one of the ministries the characterisation of norah however completely triumphs over such errors of judgment but if norah discovering herself and discovering the world fighting the opposition of forces personal and forces social is an altogether magnificent piece of work her mother lady holgate and her husband alan trenchard are frankly disappointing it was not necessary surely to paint either the one so impossibly vague or the other so count of lonaford auhor of  making conversation  goilancz impossibly futile in order to show up the heroines purposeful strength a far finer study is anthony swavne who leaves

B634,['8676852'],  james gordons wife novels op the week 3 vols hurst fc i blackett hero trevelyan by g m craik 2 vols low  co the author of james gordons wife has succeeded by sheer cleverness of writing in making readable and occasionally really interesting a story which in less able hands would probably have been insufferably dull for disguised as it is these volumes are and are meant to be a sermon the sin of intellectual pride being the text parts of the book particularly the reflections of the hero on arriving at a true knowledge of himself would read remarkably well in a discourse from the pulpit there is nothing like cant in them for cant is essentially insincere and there is a straightforward sincerity about this writer which commands ones respect even if its expression sometimes moves ones laughter james jordon is a genius who goes through eton and cambridge with great eclat finishing his academical career as senior wrangler and first smiths prizeman in short he is an intellectual giant and being far from unconscious of his stature he is not elated by the adulation of the pigmies among whom he moves he sincerely believes himself to be born for great things and deliberately sets himself to accomplish his mission in the eyes of his elder sister olivia hs is a demigod and worshipped accordingly in those of his younger sister cicely he is a prig and we think most people would be inclined to agree with the latter despising love as a foe to intellectual advancement he falls deeply in love with his cousin gabrielle wynn whom the death of her father has consigned to his guardianship struggles desperately against the passion which he fancies is degrading him but is of course worsted in the end and she becomes his wife the rest of the story is soon told after a year of unalloyed happiness mr gordon finding that his wife has become almost a necessity of his life resolves to liberate himself from her thraldom and if possible recover the selfsufficiency which he imagined to be his before he married her the coldblooded manner in which he addresses himself to this task regardless in his allabsorbing egoism of the possible consequences to the woman whose absolutely unselfish devotion he thus repays is cleverly and forcibly described the unequal struggle however does not last long and an attack of malignant scarlet fever which leaves him physi jally blind at the same time removes the scales which had darkened his spiritual eyesight intellectual pride is crushed and love is triumphant the stoic has thrown his philosophy to the winds and sits at the feet of his wife in the school of love here the book ends too abruptly for those readers who are interested in mr charles godfrey and cicely gordon both welldrawn charactersthe latter perhaps a little overdrawn apart from one or two vulgarisms which ladywriters seem unable to resist putting into the mouths of athletic young gentlemen from the universities such as  awfully down in the mouth c the style of the whole book is far above the level of the average novelist but it sins on the side of extravagance miss craiks novel is remarkable first on account of its title the quaint and certainly rather pretty name she has allotted to her heroine and secondly for the adoption of the gossiping or confidential style a proceeding which on social grounds we are inclined to resent whatever convenience or virtue may be latent in  i think  and  you know the confidential method of telling a story seems generally a poor substitute for making the characters tell their own tale and we prefer to base our estimate of them in novels as in real life upon their own words and actions rather than to accept assertions about their character from a candid friend neither is an author presumably upon such terms of acquaintance with the public as to expect a ready response to her friendly overtures of intimacy with this exception and the grand defect of wasting her heroine coram populo with the unromantic malady of hipdisease the story such as it is is fairly told we learn how a fashionable young lady much addicted to coquetry and somewhat brusque in her style of repartee is reduced by bodily infirmities to so gracious an attitude of mind as to accept thankfully the addresses of an admirer who plays benedick to her beatrice and to whom she at first disdains to accord her heart the gentleman who is as rough a lover as the lady is a petulant mistress begins with a strong aversion and contempt for the frivolity and coquetry of miss trevelyan but when she is laid upon a sick bed and a long convalescence gives him an opportunity of observing her character  swelling pity  does for him what it did for duncan gray and the mutual antipathy between these results in a cordial attachment there are some layfigures of no interest who fill the subordinate parts and this excessively domestic story is brought within the modest space of two volumes to an end where most writers would probably have thought of beginning we may remark as another peculiarity which might be worth the notice of intending authors tending to save much labour on both sides that the reader whose imaginative powers have never been pandered to by any uncertainty as to the events recorded is requested to supply that source of interest by  finishing the story as he likes this suggestion might be indefinitely improved upon a blank volume to be filled up as one chose would possibly be preferable to works of so slender a calibre,folklore_contra

B3269,['9050617'],  alone in west africa by mary gaunt werner laurie the avidity with which travel books are sought after by the public is apt to thrust into the market a type of descriptive work which wilfully trades upon the readers curiosity the principle of  omne ignotum pro magnifico focuses attention on the unknown country rather than the qualities that go to the visualising of it and tends to submerge critical acumen to avoid careful study becomes an acute temptation for this reason and on account of the multiple and disconnected impressions left by a book of this nature personality is invaluable in supplying unity and distinction and fixing a rallyingpoint for the reader mrs gaunts new book fulfils this demand it is not so much that her personality is virile and commanding as that it is sufficient to cut a way for the reader through the jungle of her journeys her salient capacity is a surprising and quickening commonsense she refuses to take things on trust alert enough to test all she hears and sees by her own experience our sole objection to her lucid and conscientious narrative is that she tends to lapse into impressionistic journalism the purely descriptive portions of her adventurous jaunt through littleknown districts in west africa do not call for detailed treatment mrs gaunt started up the gambia from bathurst through the  groundnut colony a land of promise so far as productivity is concerned she skirted sierra leone the white mans grave  staying a short time at its dirty illkempt capital freetown and spent some interesting days in liberia autonomous since 1822 through the courageous experiment of america for the semicultured native she has scant praise insisting on his boorishness his arrogance his raw and blatant egoism passing through the guinea coast almost fabulous in its natural beauties she reached half assinie and the french border from elmina the old portuguese mining settlement her pilgrimage took her to accra the capital of the gold coast colony up the volta to the krobo hills infamous for the mystic bloodorgies there practised by the nearly savage inhabitants over the eketo range and so to the border into the german colony of togo thence she travelled along the coast to the best point of vantage and turned inland into ashanti which has cost england so much money and so many lives and finally dipped down from kumasi its capital to the atlantic seaboard at sekondi where her route ended like another district which we deal with elsewhere much of this country had not been traversed before by a white woman mrs gaunts facile and rather gusty style never drifts into mere enumeration of peoples places and incidents her versatility is such that wherever she goes she kindles her narrative with patches and splashes of colour particularly illuminating are her hard penetrating comments on the prevailing fetishism concerning the west african climate the theory current as to its unredeemed vileness has she observes crystallised into superstition officials go there in confident expectation of having their energies enervated and paralysed by its humidity and in a spirit of calculated disgust they flout nature by burning the candle at both ends by falling into sedentary habits and a dumb mental resentment opposed to physical wellbeing so the consequent illhealth is as much the result of internal as extraneous causes it may be readily imagined how much the administration of the country suffers when activities but halfhearted and almost morose are applied to it mrs gaunts picture of the germans as colonisers of togo is in striking contrast to the verdict just given of their alertness regularity and cheerfulness she speaks in terms of ungrudging admiration their keen and trenchant methods of organisation she opposes to the british lack of plan and casual attitude without attempting to draw invidious comparisons she speaks of the presence of broad long roads the facilities for transit the instinct for governing the scientific warfare against sleeping sickness the insistence on cleanliness and order and the anxiety to preserve natural beauties where  england seems indifferent if the beautiful spot be not within the narrow seas german women too live with their husbands in togo their helpmeets there as at home englishmen on the other hand regard such itinerant companionship as akin to sacrilege the tropics are  no white womans country immorality and discontent are the outcome so far as ashanti is concerned however mrs gaunt is less dispiriting there a succession of zealous administrators have rescued the country from internecine strife strong measures have had the stimulating effect required concerning the vexed and seemingly inscrutable problem of the native population mrs gaunt is more reticent than we could wish her conclusions are enigmatic varying in accordance with the different status of the aborigines in different parts the halfemancipated native with his veneer of culture still she declares retains the rudiments of barbarism combined with the less agreeable characteristics of civilization his isolation from both white and black and his incapacity are complete for the primitive majority she veers towards the theory of a  benevolent despotism that depends for its validity on the temperament of the despot with whom unlimited authority is hardly favourable to the growth of sympathy and understanding and is apt to become inoculated with the virus of caesarism such are the scope and achievement of mrs

B2542,['6675108'],  uarda a romance of ancient egypt by georg ebers from the german by clara bell london sampson low  co 1877 tue very learned and brilliant author of this book tells us distinctly in his preface that its historical and archaeological features are but of secondary importance and that he wishes it to be read and criticised simply as a novel it seems to me that he has hot done his book justice by this remark and that most readers of this as of his previous novel an egyptian princess will in spite of the authors directions pay great attention to the scenery and costume and even seek to obtain from the story as such some better notion than most people have of old egyptian life the value of historical novels in teaching history has been variously estimated and scholastic people nowadays are inclined to despise them to me they seem very valuable aids in giving some sort of lifepicture of other days and if aristotle thought that tragic poetry was more philosophical than history on account of its filling out and colouring the dry outlines of hard fact so a good historical novel may be far more instructive and philosophical than many of our histories how many people have obtained true and lively views of charles the bold from anne of geierstcin or of the french revolution from the comtesse de charity  when therefore an egyptologist of prof ebers position gives us an egyptian novel based upon the monuments and papyri of the date of ramses il we expect not only entertainment but solid instruction nor will the reader find himself disappointed the external detail is very carefully filled in the theological and philosophical views of the priests are expanded in conversations perhaps too lengthy and minute characters from all classes of society are introduced and though their strange names are at first hard to remember we must do the author the credit to say that he has kept his characters distinct and has drawn thera with considerable psychological power but we confess that the less egyptian the story becomes the more interesting and lifelike is its progress as the author expressly wrarns us he has not excluded modern sentiment and this may not be false though it cannot be proved true of the old egyptians the scenery of mount sinai which he knows from personal experience is very admirably and vividly painted and we must admire his selfcontrol when he introduces moses in one scene and refrains from letting him reappear this is indeed treating the reader most generously but when we come to consider the historical sources which he has used it appears to us that he has made very free use of them indeed in some cases it is true that though he says that mes it was the egyptian name of moses he does not shock us with the whole theory of prof lauth who ascribes the stillextant roving adventures of a mohar of that name to the great lawgiver still the identification of the names is very doubtful but this is moderate compared with the account of king ramses il taken wholly from the wildest and most extreme flatteries which have survived in contradiction to many good historical inferences the king is not only represented as a marvellous warrior which may be true but as a father of his people as a man of genius of large heart and great benevolence which must surely bc false the iron despotism of his rule seems hardly compatible with the gentle and loveable features in prof ebers picture of him we also fancy from our scanty knowledge of the period that the noble and intellectual characters of the kings daughter bentanat and her intimates are beyond the condition of even the highest ladies of that time but here at least there is nothing to contradict any novelist the drawing of the greek invaders is also a questionable matter in the first place the fact of greek invasions in the fourteenth century bc is exceedingly doubtful nor are the two names occurring on though monuments which scholars would identify with aiuo and aato at all received in this sense by the most cautious critics but whether the danai did threaten egypt under ramses or not they were certainly not the beautiful and dignified people represented in the art of phidias 1000 years afterwards and yet such they appear in prof ebers sketch of them he has warned us in his excellent preface that we must not imagine the real old egyptians as they were represented in their own art he notes most justly that the rules and conventions of a strict hieratic canon prevented the artists of old egypt with a very few remarkable exceptions from attempting to imitate real life and he calls his novel an erlos ung siv eric in which he breaks through stiff formality and paints them as the most lively and versatile of men i fear that in the case of the danai he has allowed himself to fall into a trap of this kind and has been misled by an artistic type not worse but better than the real men who have indeed been perpetually misconceived because of the impressions produced by their art here and there through the book there are indications of awful oppression and cruelty which are without doubt historical and perhaps the most certain traits which we can attribute to the period the description of the gold mines for which he refers to diodorus discloses indeed one of the most shocking instances of wholesale cruelty that the world has witnessed but with great good taste he does not allow these scenes any prominence they form a dark background to the splendour of the pharaonic life the scepticism of the physician nebsecht and the ultramontane policy of the priests are both probable enough though they strike us as suggested by the authors personal experiences in the germany of the present day what prof ebers says of the art of the old egyptians is to a great extent true of their literature also so far as we possess it there are so many forms of politeness formulas of religion fixed types of language and general formality of expression that it is very hard to conceive warm hearts and wild passions under all this mass of conventional stiffness yet our author is certainly right and has done well to correct the impressions produced by the egyptian rituals and inscriptions and pictures his plot is vigorous and full of movement and if the great number and variety of his characters compel him to produce too many unexpected meetings they add to the interest and beauty of the story the reservation of ramses himself and the epic of pentaour till the third volume is another instance of wisc economy in an author who feels himself in no want of incident and who has rather too much than too little material at his disposal nevertheless uarda will hardly take a place among firstrate french or english works of fiction as an instructive and amusing sketch of life in egypt under ramses ii it should be widely and heartily welcome in adding a few words of criticism on the translation of the work we would not have it imagined that we underrate the difficulty of an idiomatic rendering of one language by another the translator is apt to see the original through the translation and so rest satisfied with sentences which seem foreign enough to the english reader viewed with a critical eye there aro many faults to be found in the present instance especially in the earlier parts in which the english version is often very strongly flavoured with german idioms there are also some useful notes omitted there are even somo mistakes such as haggard men for hagcre mcnschen birdhaunted woods for wildreiche wiilder and courageously for getrostall these in the preface elsewhere we have thichlegged for wadcnstarh used of a man and danaids for danaer such trifles might be multiplied and indeed it is only in the number of them that their weight as objections lies but anyone who has himself undertaken such a task will justly look away from these particulars and more especially in a novel attend to the general effect of the translation regarded merely as an english book he will find it on thc whole a readable and even spirited rendering and will be disposed to commend the translator for bringing so interesting a

readers whose taste lies towards african discoveries and tropical hunting scenes cannot do better than get m du cbaillus apingi kingdom those who have read miss burneys novel of camilla will certainly recollect the character of miss miffen who declares that when she is married and may order her own dinner she will ahvays have minced veal mashed potatoes and currant pie but when in the progress of the story she does get married she finds cooks intractable and always coming for orders  husbands unreasonable and never pleased with anything and always complaining of the weekly bills a somewhat similar experience in madame de witts story befalls mdlle louise who becomes by the death of her mother mistress of her fathers house and in the receipt of 1500 francs a year for the dress of herself and her two sisters  she is only sixteen and like miss miffen thinks it delightful to order dinner and be the mistress and above all to buy her own dresses all her follies and sorrows and errors are very pleasantly told and of course everybody if not perfect is at least in the way of being so before the story ends the work is beautifully translated and although it would be better for  girls in their teens  to read it in the original french it is nevertheless an excellent giftbook in its english version and girlnature is the same whether english or french the style of silken cords leaves much to he desired it is wanting in the firm light touches which can make trifles charming by the grace with which they are narrated but the intention of the tale is excellent and calculated to do good to young boys who think it manly to cast off restraint and to go on in their own way what that own way leads to and how bad habits become very galling  iron fetters are forcibly set forth whilst the  silken cords  of family affection and sisterly love prove in the end strong enough to draw the wanderer back from the brink of ruin and to lead him gently in the right path this is a story that sundayschool libraries might admit to their shelves without fear of encouraging an illicit taste for fiction mr lillie is it appears also the author of the enchanted toastingfork he has the will to be funny but not the gift to be so the king of topsyturvy is foolish enough but it is a heavy imitation of  alice in wonderland without the felicitous absurdity of that delightful book we cannot fancy children understanding the mystification of  the king of topsyturvy and we will answer for grownup people feeling helplessly bewildered mr woods book will be a delightful gift to boys  girls also who live in the country will find much to interest them there are excellent instructions as to the best methods of managing a great variety of creatures who may be elected for that very unenviable fatea  domestic pet information is given how to house them to feed them to keep them clean and to treat them well there are many interesting anecdotes and the book will inspire young people with a taste for natural history the style is pleasant and the tone of the book is good we would particularly impress the concluding remarks on all who undertake to keep animals in what mr wood calls  a gracious captivity let the owner remember he says  that his little favourite is dependent on him for every necessary and comfort of life and that it will be a piece of arrant cruelty or at all events of inexcusable thoughtlessness to permit the captive to feel the pangs of hunger or thirst or to suffer the discomforts of an unclean home the south pole is even more of a frozen deep than the arctic regions and the mystery that surrounds it is less penetrable those who have gone the furthest in the antarctic seas declare the cold to be more intense than in the high northern latitudes the whales are said to be larger and the land bleaker and more inhospitable the book of richard pengelleys experiences and adventures is very exciting and full of interest the descriptions inspire a terror of those regions quite different from the tales of arctic adventure which are rather attractive and enticing than otherwise we closed this clever book about the south pole with a shudder which mr kingston may perhaps consider a compliment boys who crave for a string of adventures will find their most exacting requirements fully satisfied the author of  mary powell has the gift of graceful narrative though her stories are sometimes of the slightest indeed they may be said occasionally to be spun out of nothing the present is a volume of short stories of unequal merit some are pleasing  and the collection is prettily got up and it is suitable and safe for a present or reward we have copied mr davidsons long titlepage and have only to say that the book keeps all these promises faithfully judicious mothers and nurses might find in it a mine of amusement as well as instruction for their young people children would not much care for the book itself those who have the charge of them must teach them how to use it 1 the young artist is a pleasing storymore romantic than probabletastefully got up it will be a welcome addition to a juvenile bookshelf,folklore_contra

had an ideal after which she has worked and this in itself is an excellent point in an author  bond and free is intended to typify those who are led by their own inclinations and impulses who are in bondage to their own selfishness contrasted with those who have rule over themselves and who take heed to do the thing that is right instead of following every passing emotion the different characters are too much like the personification of abstract principles human beings are not coinpounded of simple elements eleanor xarpenth who is intended to represent a passionatesouled woman is not true to any human nature we ever met with she is made both unhappy and repulsive the author it seems to us treats her with injustice all characters endowed with positive qualities are more likely to be wrong than those who are more negative they have more capabilities for good but their chances of evil are increased in proportion felicia the model heroine is a safe negative and she combines with all the prejudices and sympathies of the author and is well treated accordingly wilfred the hero is a weak wayward selfconscious individual he is a literary man with a mystery at the root of his life which has made his youth miserable and nearly ruined the growth of his character in manhood the conditions under which he has been educated and brought up are cruel and unnatural no mother could or ever would pursue such a plan she would sooner have sent her child to the foundling hospital than consign him to the care of a mau aahom she had so grievously avronged the mockery of the letter which was to be given to him on leaving his guardian and which was to reveal the mystery that overclouded him gives the reader a sensation of disgust aud indignation at the weak selfish cruelty of the mother who could prepare so much gratuitous suffering for her child the mother is so detestable that the reader comforts himself with the reflection that the author has failed to make her in the likeness of human nature wilfreds subsequent reformation and moral redemption from his morbid selfconsciousness do not enlist the sympathy of the reader there is good writing in the book and in spite of faults of construction the story is interesting and readable but it is not satisfactory the only moral that ave can gather from it is perhaps not the one the author intended but ave give it as a true one nevertheless viz that human beings cannot avert the consequences of their actions to bear them patiently is the only true or rational avay of meeting them and all attempts to be better and wiser than providence by saving others from the effects of their own conduct is sure to bring avorse suffering in the stead of that which it is sought to escape we look forward to a better and pleasanter book at

earnest fixes the attention even its more obvious faults are as likely to win on the readers sympathy as to offend his taste the authoress for example has been occupying herself over german with an admirable intensity of devotion and her novel is running over not only with german mottoes but with german bits of words and even conversation about german anthology in a chapter or two of lovers

old creole days the work is doubly valuable because mr cable the romancer has suppressed himself so much in order to make room for mr cable the faithful and capable editor the tales in this volume are in one way superior even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed romance have been faithfully translated or preserved whore this firsthand eviience is unattainable the romancer in deposing the editor has nevertheless chosen some true tradition for the groundwork of his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie brouillard the last is the best and the first as decidedly the weakest  salome muller  is loosely and lengthily spun ou end is hardly worthy of so skilled a practitioner as mr cable it also makes too heavy a call upon our interest in the extinct legal luminaries of new orleans fifty years ago too much is said about these phantoms and they are no convincingly reanimated  though the advocate christian roselius deserves his niche for his long duel in behalf of a most injured woman frankly what attracts us most in this and the succeeding stories is less the story itself than mr cables own combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables pencil at its best it must suffice to extract from attalie brouillard a description of the rascal quadroon camille dur our  fancy a small figure thin let us say narrowchested roundshouldered his complexion a dull clay colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own and his linen last weeks it doss not appear whether mr cable has any authority for these traits  but somebody mut surely have sat for such a portrait which we treasure as a bright scrap of reality a living face though it be but a sorry scoundrels saved from oblivion how great i the contrast between this trained portraiture of nature and the remaining four papers where nature herself meets us in all her leisurely process her repetitions her thrilling surprises produced by simple expedients these papers ere all written by women they are translated in three case and abridged in one but

laboured style it is only a pity that sa little could be printed of the french originals for the sake of their illspelt cager utterance the translations in most cases read well save that mr cable

B2042,['6182667'],  the cavaliers of virginia or the recluse of jamestown an llisto rica ilomance 3 vols a very good work and deserving notice the plot is wellconceived and embraces many stirring and grand incidents the time of action is laid precisely at that period when the accession of the second charles of england gave the cavalier party in that country and her colonies the great supremacy which in general they used so insolently the story briefly runs thus a brian oreilly with a little boy on his back that he had just saved with himself from shipwreck finds protection for both in the mansion of a mr fairfax a strange name for a cavalier and this boy proves to bc the hero of the story he is brought up with virginia the heroine and daughter of the benefactor when nathaniel liacoti the least heroic of names comes to mans estate he finds himself in love with his fostersister macon though he wishes to go the whole hog with the lady is no beggar private and very ample remittances having been from time to time forwarded to mr fairfax for the expenses of his education and finally for the purchase for him of one of the best plantations in the province now in the vicinity of these good folks there resides one of a character not altogether so unexceptionable but much more romantic  one vast gigantic regicide recluse colonel whalley thc actual husband of mrs fairfax the mother of virginia and as he him elf supposes the father of nat bacon this whalley was long sup posed to have been shot as he deserved and it was only till after this was supposed to be ascertained that mrs fairfax remarried now thc then governor of virginia was a peppery hotheaded addledbrained ultracavalier named sir william berkeley with a reprobate nephew called beverley his heir and successor virginia is an heiress and it is the arrogant governors pleasure that she shall marry his heir bacon puts in his caveat this is the state of affairs when the roundheads rise and endeavour to blow up the governor in his statehouse bacon saves the town from destruction and proves that he has other qualities besides that of  sighing at his mistress s elbow9 to be entitled a hero he gets dreadfully wounded for his pains but thinks himself well rewarded as it is the means of gaining the plighted faith of the lady we cannot even name all the intervening and attendant incidents arising from this position of affairs the reader must suppose a duel a metre with the indians and the introduction of an indian princess with a whampum belt and mocassins all very effective but which has but little to do with the course of the story except in so far as it introduces an opportunity of getting the hero to the stake and his body systematically planted all over with pine splinters preparatory to a roast but the historical and political events are thc most extraordinary for some reasons utterly unreasonable to everybody but the prejudiced old governor he allows the indian tribes to confederate and make head unmolested on the frontiers of his province at length they openly rise and ravage the country with all the ingenious ferocity of the indian the day before wyanokee formerly the servant of virginia now the head of the tribe had saved her bacon from roasting by using the red womans privilege of making him her husband and the day after these espousals without consummation we find the bridegroom in spite of himself proclaimed the general of the army of the colonists to resist the indian invasion and avenge its cruelties we think that here the fiction and the fact are improbably blended though the act of the colonists was necessary to the safety of the state indeed to its very existence the old governor stigmatised it as a rebellion calls in all the regular troops from the outposts on the extreme points of his government intending to fall upon the delivering army in the rear whilst the indian is in the front well out he marches from the capital with this commendable intention when the citizens whom he had left behind thinking this a queer way to save the country march out in the shape of another army to do battle on the governor so there are four armies going to fight each other in a line in the meantime bacon is too active isle annihilates the indian army in his front before the governor has time to attack him in the rear the old man then falls back upon the army at his tail not to right with it but to make all manner of treacherous concessions among which is that of granting regular commissions to general bacon and his officers once again in his capital he attempts to tyrannise as usual but the liberal party is too strong for him and he removes with the ships and the troops that are faithful to him to the town of acomac in the meantime bacon having impolitically left his army to reach the capital the sooner is taken in his passage by one of sir williams cruisers brought to acomac tried by a courtmartial as a traitor and sentenced to be hung of course the reader will suppose that every now and then virginia the heroine makes her appearance just when it is the most heartrending and distressingat this hanging business for example however the hero gets a days grace to prepare himself for death and next morning is found to have escaped from the cellar in which he was confined the governor again returns to jamestown and through treachery again finds himself master of his capital bacon rejoins his army they march upon the town a memorable fight ensues the loyalists are beaten and the town consumed to ashes vir ginia who always had accompanied the governor now falls into the handsarms we should have saidof the hero and they get married and all that we have not recorded some of the most striking scenes because we would not too much forestall the interest with the reader we conclude this notice by stating that the characters are well supported to the end and that the author has considerable powers of description the plot is all through exceedingly well managed and the denouement comes off admirably the faults of the volumes are a little proneness to exaggeration and a dialogue generally too pompous ana elaborate there is but one attempt at the humorous and it is completely successful that of the irish adherent we may promise all who should through our recommendation read this work that they will find we give it upon

B3318,"['8504480', '2715420', '4382821', '8678229']",  bobin gray by charles gibbon blackie and son wherever the english language is spoken the touchingly pathetic ballad of  old robin grey  is one of the most familiar of household songs and never was poetic popularity more richly deserved it is perhaps the most perfect of all ballads in respect to conception and design and the execution is fully commensurate with its other merits latterly it would seem that a revival of interest in the sad scottish story has taken place for it appeared in a dramatic form at one of our westend theatres a few weeks back and now it furnishes the groundwork of a threevolume novel by mr charles gibbon we do not know what motive mr gibbon had in selecting the simple theme of a wellknown ballad upon which to build a rather elaborate superstructure of romance as it appears to us that that portion of the story which deals with the wellknown incidents is the least interesting from the simple fact of their being so well known it is only in the first volume however that we have to do with the familiar episodes of the departure of jeamie to sea the courting of old robin grey and the wedding and the return of jeamie for the other two volumes are occupied with matter entirely of mr gibbons invention for example when the young sailor returns and finds his sweetheart married he runs in despair to a neighbours house and sits down confused and stunned unable to determine upon his movements for the future by the machinations of a certain mr nicol mcwhapple a mean scheming wretch who has wormed his way into the rather important position of laird of clashgirn by fraud and treachery jeanie is lured to this house for the supposed purpose of bringing succours to her husband who has been falsely represented to her to have met with an accident robin is afterwards brought to the same place where he discovers his wife and jeamie together and this combined with other circumstances artfully contrived by mcwhapple raises in robin such a furious passion of jealousy that he spurns his wife from him and rshes from the place the body of a man is found shortly afterwards in the vicinity of the house and is identified as that of jeamie whom robin is accused of having murdered his faithful wife jeanie refuses to believe that he is guilty of this terrible crime although the circumstaoes are very suspicious and i i she makes the most superhuman efforts to ablish i innocence notwithstanding the cruel and injurious terms that he had heaped upon her in his unreasoning jealousy she visits him in prison in order to hear the truth from his own lips i wasna expecting ye he answered in a low husky voice no with a tone of sad bitterness ye couldna think weel eneuch o me to fancy that i would care what came o ye ye thought that i would just leave ye to whatever might happen without trying to help ye maybe i should hae done that but i couldna i dinna care what ye may think o me but i

this strong man weak and helpless as a child  im thankfu to ye he said again feebly and at that all her bitterness vanished leaving only the fond sympathetic woman she advanced to him and laid her band on his arm he trembled at her touch but he made no effort to thrust her from him as she had half feared he would do i hae just ae question to speir she said softly  and after that ill no fash ye any mair wi my presence im listening did ye meet jeamie falcon after ye left me in askaig house  did ye see him again or hear him or come near him in any way she watched him with terrible eagerness as she pronounced the twords the question seemed to rouse him from his lethargy he rose to his height erect and firm as he had been before this calamity he shook her hand from his arm and his eyes flashed angrily e you too doubt me  he exclaimed hoarsely i but what else scould i expect you wha never cared for me and loved himrwhat could ye do but be the first to think me guilty   r oh man dinna speak thae cruel fause words to me the noo ibut answer meanswer me frae your heart truly as though ye ewas at the judgmentseat and gie me strength to save ye he regarded her fixedly for an instant and then answered with ra steady voice only avoiding falcons name i never saw him or heard him or came near him to my knowledge after i left him and you in askaig house  god be thankedo god be thanked for that she cried dropping on her knees with clasped hands upraised and tears of grateful joy streaming down her cheeks he turned his back upon her for he could not look upon that face so bright with faith in him without a sharp twinge of remore for all he had done to cloud it she whom he had so readily doubted whose truth he had so doggedly refused to credit she whom he had spurned from him accepted his single word against all the evidence in the world that was the sharpest sting of all to feel that she could trust him so much when he had shown so little trust in her it is not necessary to enter into all the complications of the plot which are arranged in a very masterly manner and carry the reader along in breathless interest indeed so thoroughly skilful is mr gibbon in handling his materials that we regret he did not invent the whole of his story instead of forming it upon the basis of a ballad for by so doing he has spoilt the charming simplicity of the song and by no means added to the attraction of the novel it will suffice to say that robin grey is proved guiltless of the crime with which he is charged and although jeanies sense of outraged womanly dignity induces her to hold aloof from her husband after she has completed her task of duty in refuting the false accusations against him yet she is at last reconciled to him upon the birth of a child at last he looked at the mother whose pale face was turned towards him jeanie he cried with the bsby singing a chorus will naething move ye to forgie me winna our bairn dot  and he held the child in his outstretched arms as if to let it plead for him she took the bairn to her breast hushing its cries and then she answered with a low tender voice i hae done that lang syne robin for i ken ye maun hae tholed mucklesorrow but  d inna say but he cried bending over her god kens what i hae tholed and god kens that it was because ye were sae dear to me that i was sae blind youre een are open noo  aye but what guid is that to me if they are only open to let me see what i hae lost to let me see that there is nae hope for me o winning it back in this world dinna send me awa jeanie for the bairns sake dinna send me awa she looked straight in his eyes ye hae nae doubt left in your heart that i hae told you the truth   ye mind me o my ain shameye mind me that i wish the tongue bad been cut frae my mouth afore it had spoken the words it did ye mind me o my ain misery when ye speir that  but it might rise atween us again and that is what gard me think it would be better for us no to be thegither any mair 1 ye winna trust me bitterly 0 woman if there could be onything come atween you and me again the mindin o that night at askaig would make me crush it aneath my foot like the pooshen head o a

stooped down and kissed her and so the bairn came as the fable has it with an angel message and this particular message was one of grace to robin gray the work abounds in tender touches of nature and sweet appeals to the affections and there are also many truthful sketches of rustic life and manners the finest and most elaborate painting of individual character in the book is undoubtedly that of nicol mwhapple a creation that will not suffer by comparison with any of the famous portraits of scott this character alone places  robin gray decidedly above the ordinary run of novels but there are other excellences that stamp it as a work of peculiar merit i  v fe ti coidt of g itoddapo the diso f ihe guilt of thx laid of lhwgn and the long uslfunaakhg of the latter to jeage naoon are mniaet cnceived with remarkable imagative power and wrought out with true dramatic force in an age when wellwritten novels are as oommon as tthe blades of grw upon a lawn it is something to produce a work adistinotive a fiower and this mr gibbon has accomplished  robin gray by w gibbon london h s king and co to see the story of  old robin grey  in the form of a novel or indeed in any shape other than the words of the delightful old ballad itself is we must confess a matter of regret to us as however nothing seems too sacred to a novelist or a playwriter we must put aside our own senti ments and consider only how in our opinion a novel is written in the instance of the cheap reprint under notice we are glad to be able to endorse much of the praise that greeted mr gibbons work on its first appearance the writei has kept as much as possible to the letter of the story and has shown himself able to give a picture of scottish life with singular fidelity of detail nor is he wanting in keen insight into character in pathos or in descriptive power it seems to us a mistake to marry robin at the end of the book but with this exception we must congratulate mr gibbon on having accomplished very happily an exceedingly difficult task  robin gray it is just possible that the special merit of this simple and touching storyits subdued and truthful sketches of types of scotch charactermay be missed by the english reader for mr gibbon not only draws his lairds farmers fishermen and country lasses exactly as they are but he copies with an unusual minuteness the peculiarities of their speech and pronunciation burns and sir walter scott have sown a good many scotch words among us and many of these have been incorporated into our own tongue while in later days george macdonald has given us tolerably strong doses of that pronunciation which obtains north of the tweed most educated men have at least a literary knowledge of scotchthat is to say they know enough of it to understand burns as they know enough of old english to understand thomas sackville but in either case some effort is required and a novel should not present any feature demanding particular effort on the part of the reader mr gibbons reply is of course obvious he is describing certain types of people who speak in a certain way if he describes as faithfully as he can their appearance dress disposition and manners why not also their speech the argument is irrefutable but we beg mr gibbon to be a little more merciful to us in future works and to give us a somewhat larger leaven of english while on the topic of language we must add a word about the speech used by mr gibbons highlandmen and highlandwomen we know of no other book in which even a fair approximation is made to that extraordinary form of english which the highlanders have invented sir walter scott simply burlesqued this wonderful effort in language and most other writers who have written about the highlands have made the mistake of causing their highland characters to talk scotch some of mr gibbons examples we shall quote byandby the first volume of the present novel follows pretty closely the old and pathetic ballad which gives the story its name  old rob i grey  turns up as a scotch farmer  young jamie  is james falcon an orphan who has been brought up by the laird nicol mwhapple and the heroine is jeanie lindsay a fishermans daughter to make the crown a pound young jamie gaed to sea and old robin grey came acourting me says jeanie in the song and so it happens in the story but in the meanwhile tidings have come that jamie is drowned at sea for some cause or other nicol mwhapple the laird seems anxious to dispense with jamies presence on earth and as snbsequently appears enters into league with the skipper of the brig in which jamie sails to have the vessel set on fire when the planned catastrophe does occur all hands except the hero are saved in one of the boats and return to land with the story of his death misfortunes fall upon the lindsays and robin gray the welltodo farmer presses his suit with jeanie 1er father breaks his arm their cow is stolen and robin gray a very worthy and affectionate man assists them in an unobtrusive way then jeanie is persuaded by her parents to give her consent and robin is beside himself with joy there is a touch of genuine pathos in jeanies demeanour during this interview but i was gaun to say that im no my lane and for the sake o them that need my help for the sake o a that we are awing yew gin ye can take me understanin a that im ready to be your wife robin gray and ill try to be a hithfu ane ilits  bargain he cried lod wfith joy and catching her in his arms in spite of the plate which was smashed on the floor he kinsd her with a smack which certainly sounded of delight os a bargain and thats the erls he added  there never was lover so enthusiastic and there never was lady so cold she seemed to become aware that she was playing an ungracious part for she tried to smile and said softly robin gray a novel iy charles gibon author of dangerous connections three vol london blackie a son  ye winna heed me being a wee thixg quiet fur its ma i my heart to greet nor to laugh jamie returns to find his sweetheart married from this point the story is mr gibbons owvn and we cannot escape the conviction that he works better outside the trammels of the old ballad rthe extreme simplicity and tenderness of the song seem to have unwittingly compelled him to write this version of it in a subdued and minor key in the second and third volumes we find the same accuracy of portraiture as in the first but we find also an additional vigour and freedom which deal boldly with incident and detail and awaken a powerful interest the story after jamies return shows the simple materials of the ballad shaken into new combinations jamie sees his married sweetheart and has a brief and pathetic interview with her imprudently she conceals the fact of her having seen him from her husband who hears of jamies visit nevertheless it is the laird mwhapple who is trying to rouse the old farmer into jealousy and he effectually does so for he forges a letter which causes jeanie alone to set out and travel to a house in which james falcon is now living and then he tells robin grey that jeanie has gone off to meet her old lover robin follows her the night is frightfully stormy and he has to cross a swollen torrent in which his horse is lost he reaches the house finds his wife cruelly upbraids her and will not listen to her explanations finally he rushes out into the fierce night again jeanie rushing after him hears a loud scream and catches sight of her husband hurrying through the dark next day a dead body terribly mutilated is found among the rocks in the river when the spate has subsided the body is dressed in the clothes of james falcon for whose murder robin grey is now apprehended however james falcon again turns up explaining that he had lent some clothes on that night to a poor idiot lad who must have been mistaken for him and murdered robin grey is not the less in danger as the presumption is that lhe had thrown the lad over the cliff believing him to be james falcon jeanie comes to falcon and beseeches him to aid her in getting her husband out of danger this they do between them for it transpires that the real murderer of the lad was a certain ivan carragh the tool of mwhapple mwhapple is in the possession of property which ought to belong to falcon and fearing that jamie may discover the means by which he has been robbed of his birthright the laird resolves upon his destruction that the crime is brought home to him in the endthat he dies in prisonand that ivan carragh comes to the gallowsare details necessarily demanded by poetical justice but for the close of the storybeautiful and appropriate as it iswe are entirely indebted to mr gibbon we confess to have had a fear that robin grey was about to perish in some sudden and opportune manner to allow jamie to marry his old love but nothing of the kind occurs robin grays extreme affection for his wife is repaid by a loyal trust and love which are but the natural expressions of jeanies character and falcon having got the lairds property goes again to sea comes back a captain marries and is henceforward the fast friend of jeanie and her guidman how mr gibbon brings us to see that this end of the story is the proper oneindeed the only one which could possibly satisfy the readerwe cannot exhibit here in theso meagre outlines of the tale ivan carragh is a capital character indeed he is about as satisfactory a villain as we have ever met with in a book his sublime unconsciousness his coolness his splendid capacity for whisky and his excellent gaelic make him quite a treasure after he has gagged jeanie and carried her on board the brig he quietly remarks  youll no care to jump into the water and if youll doill no care then he asks her goodnaturedly if  shell hae a dram there is a fine touch of humour here which many readers might not perceive among the lower classes in scotland the general form of salutation addressed to any one entering a house is will ye tak a dramp accordingly mr gibbons characters whether bent on murderous or felonious intent invariably ask each other to  hae a dram there is something peculiarly odd in the notion of a mans being confronted by his bitterest enemy and yet out of custom asking him to drink whisky when carragh is drawn into conversation about the man whom he fancied he had murdered the old habit is so strong upon him that he drinks h good health here is a conversation between jeanie and ivan when the latter has carried her on board the brig  ie suddenly dropped his fat dirty hand on

probably no ballad has ever attained so great and lasting a popularity as that of old robin gray written almost exactly one hundred years ago by lady anne barnard daughter of one of the earls of balcarres it almost instantly upon publication excited an extraordinary degree of admiration which has scarcely diminished with the lapse of time the tender truthful and affecting picture of high principle in humble life which forms its subjectmatter and the simplicity of diction which marks its composition have from the first recommended it to all readers of pure and refined taste at the same time the evidences of real power which it unquestionably possesses the truly tragic depths of feeling which it lays bare and the dramatic ability strongly evidenced in the narration of the story entitle it to a high literary position as a work of art it has taken its place among those few compositions of any age which are the common property of allof the unlearned as well as of the learned in the novel form it would certainly be impossible to say that it has not suffered but it is no mean praise to say that it has not suffered very greatly mr gibbon is to be congratulated upon having performed a very difficult task better than was to be anticipated from the difficulties which necessarily stood in his way he has n only reproduced in prose the original story with remarkable fidelity but he hs provided a very reasonable and spirited continuation of it and has brought about his catastrophe withousviolating in any marked degree either the cd sistency of the characters or thc probabilities of the situation as pictured in thc poem it is true the dialogue is written in a somewhat unmanageable scotch dialect and this may be a difficulty with southern readers but north of the tweed it is doubtless an extra charm and besides being a perfectly justifiable artifice it has the strong precedent of the original to favour it altogether we are persuaded from our own experience that this difficulty once surmounted a perusal of the book will repay those readers who care for a pretty tale prettily told with not too much horror or sensation in it and some really fine touches of nature interspersed here and there the ballad closes with the dismissal of the returned former lover and the resolution of old robin grays wife to be true to him even in thought under all and any circumstances this period is in the novel the commencement of the catastrophe james falcon the first lover has returned and is known to be in the neighbourhood by an artfullycontrived scheme robin grey is rendered jealous of him and soon after what is supposed to be his body is found under circumstances which lead strongly to the inference that foul play has been resorted to robin grey is arrested and thrown into prison and jeanie his wife rendered desperate not so much by this circumstance as by the fact of his believing her guilty resolves to penetrate the mystery at all nazards in order to accomplish this she is made to embark in a series of adventures the recital of which is perhaps the weakest part of the book resulting of course in the triumphant vindication of her husbands innocence robin grey is released and restored to the arms of his affectionate wife the real murderer turns up in the person of ivan carrach a halfdrunken shipscaptain and falcon supposed to be dead explains how upon the night of the murder he changed clothes with an idiot boy who thus suffered in his stead all are thus made comparatively happy though we fancy it would have savoured more of true poetic justice were falcon to have been got rid of finally in some honourable manner and not to have turned up again married and thus untrue to his first romantic passion,folklore_contra

rectitude in this respect a contrast to her brother stanley who having been a spoiled and petted child has grown up a somewhat idle wild dissipated youth and having sold out of the army isat present apparently without an object in life he is aware however of aliss brandons feelings towards himself and although miark and he were never on very friendly terms and notwithstanding the impending marriage he pays a visit to his sister and the endgaged couple and converses with all ostensibly at ease and without prejudice against any but being a plotter and schemer by instinct lays his plans accordingly mark wylder is suddenly called away about ten days before the wedding on a trifling business to london  and though letters are immediately afterwards received from day to day both by his lawyer and by lake at first excusing himself for his unexpected stay next postponing the marriage and on a further occasion releasing dorcas from the engagemient giviing lake power to act for him in pecuniary matters and so forth no really satisfactory reason is assigned for his longcontinued absence lrumours reach the car of his solicitor of a former clandestine marriaae of a dishonourable transaction at cards which necessitates his temporary absence and of other matters supposed to be possibly productive of the same result but still letters frequently though at irregular periods come to hand relating to the management of his property and even one curtly expressing his acquiescence in the contemplated union between stanley and dorcas which is it may be added finally celebrated to the great discomfiture of lady chelfords projects in the meantime rachels life which was once all tranquillity and happines8 has become overclouded with fears anxieties miseries conversations2 dark and only half intelligible and fragmentary scenes of a paifully mysterious character take place between her and her brother she becomes estranged from dorcas and both from stanley the only being whom either had ever loved the unhappy wife being now made aware that some strange and important secret eiists between brother and sister of which she is not permitted to partake the rev w wylder marks brother and his affairs at this juncture of the story proceed to occupy the work in considerable force and contribute not a little to the general ule while his honourable and affectionate nature imposed on at a sides the simplicity of his wife dolly and the pathetic circu stances in which their only treasure little  fairy is presented to the reader are felt as a relief to the complicated rascalities of other characters both within and without the circle of this sijgulu  i3 ii famnily the sanctimonious lawyer larkns cautiofs ana   fully executed attempts to keep iin favour both with

brandon property we cannot without disclosing the final issue of his varoli schemes which would be imprudent give any more in detail it is sufficient to add that the work is not of an ordinary character thi story is well conceived powerfully sustained and thoroughly wrlout up not only in its main features but its minor accewsories  wylder8 hand a novel by joseph sheridan le fanu 3 vols bentleywylders hand by the author of  the house by the churchyard is a great improvement on that novel it fulfils the promise which it gave and avoids most of the faults wylders hand is a clever story the reader will be carried on by too strong an interest to have time to pause for criticism when the book is closed and ho has time to consider he may perhaps object to some of the details but the fact will remain that the novel is one of sterling interest it is well put together and the mystery is very cleverly kept up the reader is just sufficiently taken into the confidence of the author to be able to feel a strong sympathy with though personages concerned whilst at the same time there is sufficient concealment to stimulate curiosity and on the whole the dcnomcnt is adequate to though preparation  we say on the whole because the final iii seo very of the cause of mark wylders mysterious disappearance is not sufficiently marked our readers would scarcely thank us to tell them the whole story but we will keep the authors secret ind give the outline of the tale the scene is laid in a line old manorial countryhouse in a midland county the scenes are all well described the short preliminary sketch of the two families the wylders and the brandons is an excellent introduction to a dark and shadowy story there were wylders of brandon and brandons of brandon in one generation a wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the brandons the next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto the estates were back again with the wylders a statement of title is usually a dry affair but that of the dynasty of brandon hall was a truculent romance this strong bad handsome halfinsane halfdiabolical race who must have descended in aright line from cain or the corsair are represented at the period when the story begins by dorcas brandon the proud beautiful apathetic heiress of the manorhouse who seems to suffer for the sins of her forefathers rather than to partake of their evil nature there is a complicated coubinship of all the chief parties the wylders whose estates join those of brandon and whose people were every bit os wicked are about to be joined together in matrimonythe estates and the owners mark wylder a rough dark evilomened seacaptain who does not belie his blood having just succeeded to the wylder estates is on the point of marriage with his cousin dorcas he would greatly prefer his poor cousin rachel lake who lives in a lonely picturesque farmhouse called redmans dell whilst dorcas prefersbut that is one of thc secrets well there is a sinister but very elegant capt stanley lake rachels brotherone of the brandon and wylder cousins the father bas committed suicide after spending all his fortune and the son is an idler scamp and coxcomb of one of her majestys regiments of guards with nothing to recommend him to mercya dark scheming plotting head and a cold heart with a talent for telling lies and forging letters which ought to have brought him to the gallows if it had not made his fortune he tyrannises over his sister who is the only character quite free from the evil taint that runs in the three families she is however a victim to it there is some secret of rascality between stanley lake and mark wyldera secret which apparently makes mark dread his cousin as well as detest him they go out together one night though week before the marriage and mark wylder never returns letters are received from him speaking mysteriously of his affairs and of some old scrape the consequences of which have obliged him to go suddenly abroad he sets his betrothed bride free from her engagement and letters on business continue to be received written by him from different continental towns giving directions about his property and speaking of his return the lawyer to whom his letters are chiefly addressed has a great deal to do in the story but his part is far too longall his chicaneries and attempts to overreach poor william wylder marks brother are wearisome and occupy the space needed for the dinohment some time after the departure of mark wylder dorcas brandon marries stanley lake the reader has been prepared for this exchangetho reader knows what a scoundrel he is without heart or conscience but dorcas brandon does not know it she is infatuated about him had determined to renounce her engagement to mark if mark himself had not saved her the trouble but stanley lake has difficulties and mysteries of his own in which he has involved his sister rachel and a dark terrible mystery gathers over the whole house of brandon there aro some touches of imagination which though they have nothing absolutely to do with the story heighten the interest and are extremely effective tamar the old nurse and though spectral figure of uncle lorn are powerful sketches though descriptions of places too are so well managed that rocks trees pathways ami even the very furniture of certain rooms add to the weird ghostly awe inspired by the dark nameless crime that haunts the story gradually gathering distinctness and becoming palpable until in the end it stands revealed and confessed as we have said the dinohmcnt is not sufficiently worked out but it has substance enough to justify though preparation mr le fanu shows qualities that ought to enable him to write even better novels than the present his style is forcible and brilliant and his faculty for graphic description sometimes leads him to bestow too much time and minute delineation on secondary characters lawyer larkins and his rascalities are followed at far too great a length  the reader does not caro to be diverted from the main stream of the interest but  wylders hand is a remarkable story ami we recommend our readers to get it for

B7243,['8370428'],  cha4rles reades no vels i believe that publisherswho have their opinions just as other people and perhaps may be supposed to know something about booksare fully agreed upon one point that women make more successful novelists than men looking at the question from a publishers point of view considering that there are a dozen women who read novels to one man that most women like most men are lacking in imagination and therefore like to have things presented from their own the feminine point of view this fact does not seem remarkable probably scotts novels when they first came out were in less demand than those sweet works of letitia matilda hawkins and one can very well understand how those books which prophesy smooth things accept all the little social makebelieves and consider the convenances as if they were actually the revealed law may be more delightful to many people than those which set forth the grave and terrible realities of the world the solemn responsibilities which years bring upon us all the temptations which beset us the ambitions and the disappointments the inherent nobility of human nature the possibilities always open to the most fallen and the east importance of every single mans conduct to those who are associated with him making every allowance however for the people who read only to be made to laugh for those who have small imagination for those who like smooth stories of society and for those who like to read what may be called tales of the lower nature it has always been to me matter of great astonishment that the appearance of a novelist among us like charles read should not have been receivedi do not say with wider popularitybut with a more ready and more generous appreciation on the part of the critical press the truest and best distinction which a writer can obtain is the appreciation of the general reading public and it may be said of the novelist as of the dramatist that critics who may at the outset greatly help a new man cannot even if they try extinguish him critics for instance for a good many years went on trying to extinguish miss braddon but they failed and her books continue to rise in reputation they said all kinds of hard things about her yet she got a larger dlienlle with every new novel the reason was that the critics only saw certain obvious faults of style and failed to see beneath the style the genuine storyteller the real secret why miss braddon has succeeded is because she has always a good story to tell and has always told it effectively in fact there is good reason for the success of every novel that does succeed it may be in bad tastethe majority of mankind do not know good taste from bad it may be vulgarthe majority of mankind are themselves vulgar it may turn on forms of wickedness about which some people prefer not to speak but others love to read it may treat of the lowest depths like  lassommoir some people like to be in imagination among the very beasts of the people so that if a work of fiction be in demand it behoves the critics to discover what are the qualities which cause this demand now in the case of charles read we have a long series of novels every one of which has been successful and many enormously successful yet he has received from critics nothing more than the usual brief comment accorded to every writer of the least name as each novel was presented to the world i am not so foolish as to suppose that critics ever try to keep a man down here and there a malicious onslaught may be made but as a rule they seem to me a kindhearted and indulgent body there is however a wide difference between recommending one book after the other and forming a deliberate judgement on the position occupied by the author of many remarkable novels there exists perhaps among critics something of the sheeplike quality which makes them follow where one has had the courage to lead no one has yet led so that while we have been inundated with essays on the genius of george eliot miss thackeray and others i do not remember to have read one single serious effort to explain charles reades success to account for the popularity of his novels or to award him his place among english authors perhaps his success is not even known yet i believe that among those who do know it is perfectly well understood that of all living men who write novels he is the most widely known the most read and the most admired remember that there are the people in america in india and in our colonies to consider besides the subscribers to our circulating libraries in the quiet plantations on the coffee tea sugar and indigo estates on the silent sheep runs in faraway farmhouses in the states and canada and the colonies everywhere the men read novels here in this country there are more women readers of novels than men in the colonies men and women together all love novels and read as many as they can buy and if all englishspeaking readers were to vote for the best of living novelists there can be little doubt that they would name charles reade since the quartfrly revines have been silent therefore i should like to be allowed to state some of the reasons which in my mind have united in placing this writer in this position i wish be it understood to speak not as a critic but as an admireri am one of those who would so vote i entirely agree with the popular verdict i for one consider that read takes rank with fielding smollett scott dickens and thackeray that is to say in the great and delightful art of fiction wherein the englishwho are always in every age doing something better than their neigh bourshave surpassed the world charles read stands among the foremost and best first then he is a scholar this means among other things that he brought to the study of living man and woman a knowledge of ancient men and women he knew what to expect the forces which impel mankind and drive us hither and thither are and always have been the same necessity still rules those who speak english as she ruled those who spoke greek the same temptations assail us they are met with the same heroism or the same cowardice the way of the least resistance is always open to man and he generally to his discomfiture takes that way we change the sky but not the mind of man when we read aristophanes lucian martial and horace those have become already critics of humanity who have read these writers a liberal education of course means much more than thisdoes reades strong and vigorous style owe nothing to early compositions in latin and greek but this is surely a great deal before that great anatomist rabelais held scalpel in hand he had studied all that was written by the men of old on the human frame when filled with awe and adoration towards the maker of so wondrous a mechanism he stood before his subject about to penetrate the mysteries of the body he knew what to expect so he who would show the mysteries of action thought motive and desire should first have studied in the ancient schools it is a great injury for instance that we have done to women in withholding from them the liberal education in restoring it to them at their new colleges and high schools we have taken the greatest step towards putting them on the same level with men i believe that by means of likra humanios women will recover the critical faculty learn what is meant by style study epigram and perhaps cease to believe without reason it will be a strange outcome of this revolution in education if in twenty years or so the women novelists will write like read rather than like their predecessors of the present generation secondly charles read is a dramatist observe that the drama permits almost everything except verbosity and tameness a drama may have nearly every fault and yet succeed if it be lively and not verbose but the great majority of novels are verbose to the last degree without action and without incident if such a story as  griffith gaunt for instance be compared with almost any ordinary novel of the day the first note of difference will be found in the overwhelming amount of incident in the former as compared with the latter the second that the descriptions of persons scenery place voice gesture c necessary in every novel are much shorter in  griffith gaunt  than the other the third that the conversations do not drag and seem too long or discursive but that they carry on the action and develop the characters our old dramatists hung up a scroll on which was written  a room in the kings palace the actors by their dialogue and their gestures presently brought the place home to the imagination the spectators saw that splendid roomthey were actually sitting in it they were assisting at the council of the kings most excellent highnessthough the play was but on trestles in the courtyard of an inn slow brains saw nothing then as now if you give them the stage mounting of the haymarket they see no more you cannot by any means of upholstery tear out of himself for a moment the unhappy wretch who has no imagination now charles read in his novel work resembles the old dramatists if he takes his reader to a north country fishing village he does not make up an elaborate picture of the houses the boats the nets spread out upon the seashore the smell of the fish the narrow streets the reek and the dirt of it i do not say that in some hands such a description is not pleasing but it is not part of reades method he is not a painter of scenery nor of houses he does not care for picturesque  bits  and effects of light unless they help his story he is a painter of men and women therefore in the space of half a page or thereabouts he introduces us briefly to the kind of folks we are to meet and then sets them to talk for themselves not a bit of furniture not an inch of tapestry no blue china no cabinets yet when all is told and the curtain drops we know the place where the people live better than if we had read pages of description this is the art of the dramatist fielding who is also a great gossip and perpetually talking to the reader on his own account possesses this art his characters by their acts and their conversations reveal themselves and their surroundings for my own part i have always wondered how charles read could bear his novels to be illustrated except out of kindness to his weaker brthred i saw lately in a review the statement perfectly and literally true but actually made as an objection that read describes his characters from the outside exactly the dramatist describes his characters  from the outside there they are on the stage the king with his crown the soldier with his sword the priest with his shaven crown what more do you want presently they begin to talk and they show themselves as they go on building up their characters bit by bit or it may be revealing themselves in one or two masterstrokes the forciblefeeble writer describes his characters from the inside that is he tells you beforehand what he wants you to think of them this method helps the folk whose imaginative powers are weak it will therefore continue to be practised and to be in demand but which may we ask is the better art to make the characters reveal themselves or to describe them from the  inside looking therefore upon his story always as a dramatist considers his plot reade at the outset seems to have considered strength as the first essential in his work he aims continually at strength  he achieves strength in three ways first by a style which is always reined in nervous and vigorous in the purest english next by clearness of vision in his own mind you cannot draw a portrait when you do not see the face witness the blurred features of daniel deronda whose portrayer wrote round him and about him right through four dreary volumesor was it sixand left him as uncertain to the reader as he was to his biographer thirdly reades strength is achieved by his conscientious fidelity to truth not only is he true to his characters but he is trve to his plots i mean this there are so many complications possible in life that there is no difficulty whatever in finding the materials for a story but the artist must have story and characters to match he must have players who can play the parts and look the characters he must have a plot which springs naturally from the given conditions and does not appear manufactured the age the position the very names of his characters must belong to his story now all reades stories are strong and strong in their studied art which seems so unstudied many of them depend upon situations which in less skilful hands would be merely melodramatic in his they belong to the natural development of the plot thus  it is never too late to mend is one long series of striking incidents it is like a french play in five acts and cinquante tableaux there is material enough in it to make a dozen threevolume novels with the wordspinning and characterdrawingm which fill them out in  love me little love me long the contrast between david dodd and reginald talboys struck almost at the opening is a situation in itself maintained throughout with wonderful skill and success then is there anything more delicious than peg woffington pretending to be a portrait in triplets studio in put yourself in his place he covers the canvas with incidents he is prodigal of incident as becomes one who is fertile in devising situations continually new while in the short  wandering heir he has at least halfadozen situations all new and all strong one need not continue the list enough has been said to show my meaning that strength is the main quality desired by this author endless as are the variations which differentiate men so that the day will never come when the choice is exhausted the novelist who has studied his art has to remember that while many of the varieties lying ready to his hand are uninteresting he has to select for the purposes of his groups only those who will fall naturally into line with the rest and be able to take their part in the development of the story if you consider you will observe that read never introduces a needless character nothing more hinders a play nothing more endangers its success than a character not wanted reade as i have said before writes his novels as if he were writing a play scene after scene act by act the story advances what does not help the story along must be cut out and as in a play a man does not come on the stage with a paper tacked on his back describing his character but proceeds to show himself by words so in these novels every character shows who and what he is by words and deeds many weak writers can imagine vividly and can describe more or less what they imagine their characters to have done and why they did it reade on the other hand i repeat does not describe he makes his puppets act their own story and tell it themselves putting in only here and there the necessary explanation the canida jundmra which must never be beside the subject and must like the conversation advance the story he is not himself a narrator so much as a dramatist his works are almost ready for the stage his characters portray themselves strength truth aninationthese are three excellent qualities for a novelist to possess they will not be denied to charles read even by his enemies there is however a great deal more i have observed that he is a scholar and a student he says himself  wandering heir appendix p 305 i studied the great art of fiction closely for fifteen years before i presumed to write a line of it i was a ripe critic long before i became an artist my critical knowledge has directed my art but the practice of that art has not diminished my studies he has approached art therefore in the truest spirit that of a resolute student who knows that there is much to learn but is conscious of his powers i know no other example in history of a writer who deliberately proposed to become a novelist and spent fifteen years in preparation for his work the preparation was manifold in meditation about the quiet walks of magdalene in cultivated talk in the fellows common room in life among books in life among men in studies of french books and of francereades wide reading in french literature lends a flavour to his work which is as charming as it is easy to be recognised by those who also read french when he finally sent forth his first workit was i think  peg woffington a master in fiction already full grown stood before the world in another part of the appendix to the wandering heir he defines fiction as the art of weaving fact with invention if he goes on to say it were mere arrangement of fact thousands could write it the paragraphwriters and pennyaliners would become great novelists if it were pure invention the young would beat the older men out of the field but they do not because though they have invention they have not accumulated facts and they have no art dickens is the only great novelist who made an early success and there are many circumstances in his youthful history which account for that success let us therefore consider what is meant by the word fact he means that whatever be the story finally decided upon by the novelist it must be based upon a solid substructure of social life which must not be invented but be a faithful and truthful presentment of reality now the hardest thing in the world to get at is reality there are six hundred and fifty men in the house of commons hammering all night long and every night over what they call reality and the only reason why they do not agree is because they cannot convince each other of the real truth what then is the novelist to do he must go to all the available sources of evidence he must collect together all the undisputed facts and draw his own conclusions he must spare no pains in working out the problem for himself so far as the data allow and with no bias thus to illustrate reades method he found in the trades unions and the strikes with all the tyrannical cruelties and contempt of law and justice manifested in bringing the men within the unions an excellent subject for his pen he began therefore by collecting together arranging and digesting a solid body of facts he collected them from various local journals from blue books and reports very likely from visits to sheffield and other places and from conversations with workmen and their leaders when he had got these quite ready and not before he constructed his story now a story may lend itself to facts but facts cannot be got to accommodate themselves to a story there is the result howeveran actual presentment of a trades union a living chapter for future ages of this nineteenth century life all his books again represent life in action thackeray loved to sit at a club window and watch the procession along the pavement of old fogies old bucks old warriors old dowagers young dandies girls in carriages actresses gamblers brave young country lads admiring colonials and the rest who make up the world of clubs and of society reade who cannot be compared with thackeray because there is no single point at which they touch loves the life of action it is the brave workman fighting singlehanded against a union it is the young sailor handsome gallant and simplehearted against the man of the world it is the girl disguised as a man it is the wretched criminal struggling upwards to the level of self respect or the husband tortured by jealousy always real life with flesh and blood temptations and a hatred of hothouse and artifi ciality all his charactersyes allare men and womcn because if he flings a figure even for a moment on the canvas he finishes it with a few bold strokes and it remains a portrait not an uncertain phantom the true artist will not scamp any part of his work everybody is real everything seems to happen as it might happen to all of us even when the scenes are the most romantic and the situations are the most unexpected and this because he weaves his fact with his inventions so that one hardly knows where reality ends and romance begins and the novels taken altogether cover so wide an area that we may certainly accord to read the glory of being the chief painter of english modern life in its many forms from the belle of the season to the fishfag and from the peer to the convict i believe however that the great uninteresting stratum of life known as the  lower middle class  has been left quite untouched by him probably because he knows nothing of it he gathers his material where he can like moliere and shakespeare if he wants to write about modern times there are the daily papers the essays of the monthly press the bluebooks the pamphlets all kinds of things it he wants to write about the past there is the literature of the age to teach him some years ago an attack was made upon him on account of this very use of literature i would rather not speak of the trouble because the assailant is no more among us but one must allude to it in the story of the  wandering heir  the author had occasion to describe the gambling of a ladies party he went to that treasury of social manners and customs4swifts works and found in the wellknown  journal of a modern lady the ordering of a ladys whole day from morning to evening with the style of talk which went on he was accused of plagiarism and defended himself in a pamphlet which must be allowed to be a masterpiece of good english as well as of strong invective the following is the process as described by himself by which he handles his materials the perusal should be instructive for young noveliststhe first strata of facts i had to build my figment on were two reported trials in one james annesley was defendant on a charge of murder in the other craig v anglesey he was virtually plaintiff in a trial at bar for great estates and titles you will find the first case in  howells collection of state trials the second craig v anglesey is badly reported in howell i used the folio report published by smith  bradley dublin 1744 this book shall be deposited with my publishers that any novelist or critic who likes may see the use i have made of it the next source of fact was the amemoirs of an unfortunate nobleman written by james annesleys attorney upon the whole it is a tissue of falsehoods but there are a few invaluable truths in it the lies declare themselves trumpettongued the truths arc confined to james annesleys adventures whilst he was a slave in the colonies and his return home with admiral vernon i used a few of the truths and shunned all the falsehoods the memoirs being rather a rare book shall be deposited with my publishers for inspection in the three books i have now named lies half a plot but only iefntion of equal hwer with tah facts could make it a whole plot therefore i invented philippa and all her business and the whole sexual interest of the story i tell you this union of fact and imagination is a kind  intellectual copulation and has procreated the best fiction in every age by a law of nature to go into smaller details the irish schoolmaster and his  tall talk  are from facts supplied in print by carleton the irish curses i have used are culled with great study from three authors carleton banim and griffinand selected from an incredible number the decayed irish gentleman  the scornful dog who eats dirty puddings is fact taken from  a tour in ireland published 1740 to be found in the british museum the country costumes the price of salmon and other particulars are taken from the  postchaise companion in ireland  and  twisss tour in ireland the great salmon leap from  twisss tour in ireland the turf backgammon board with a boy for dice from oral traditionit was told me forty years ago by an irish gentleman who had it from his father the incomparable speech arrah people people c i had entire from the mouth of an irishman who heard it actually delivered in a fair the abductions and sham abductions of irish girls from ireland sixty years ago and sir j lubbocks  origin of civilisation c c in the other hiberniana of the story i have used the various histories of dublin and cork by gilbert and others the exrept anagwixm the  post chaise companion it ireland letters from a gentleman in ireland to a gentleman in bath rather an uncommon book and a very rare collection of old irish journals i obtained by groping that city for them the charning series of incidents in which john purcell figures are fom his sworn evidence and almost verbatim the abduction of the heir in open daylight is also sworn evidence see craig v anglesey the uncle beating his niece her flight to foreign parts and his apprehension on a charge of murder is a recorded fact i got it out of a chapbook but it has been referred to by jurists in my own day and i also possess it in a ballad called the  new west country garland  james annesleys adventure with christina mccarthy her shah penitence her cajolery and attempt to poison him were told by james annesley to his attorney and printed by him in  the memoirs i and i have set that gem of female nature in my story the discovery of james on board admiral vernons ship by his old schoolfellow matthews rests on the same basis of recorded fact the curious advertisement by jeweller drummond is an actual advertisement of the day taken verbatim from the gteaemans maguzine banker drummonds ancestor inserted it flizabeth shipleys character and her remarkable dream about wilmingtonthis and other vilmingtonia are condensed from ferriss  history of the original settlements on the delaware and from barkers i history of the primitive settlements but whatever in that part of the story bears upon the flagellation and other punishments of men and women and the legal relation of the planters to their white servants has been taken direct with careful study and precision from the various  charters and acts of assembly  of each separate state at or near the ulate of my story and here my method has kept me clear of the errors of james annesleys attorney who says in the memoirs that two of jamess companions were executed in the stakt of drlawart for elopement and suspicion of adultery now the law in that state inflicted no such punishment it imprisoned whipped and lettered it did not kill these colonies were hard upon religious offences but on the whole they did not take life half so recklessly as the mother country did at that time and with regard to sexual criminality they exacted such difficult proefs that their laws on that head were much thunder and little lightning the anglicana generalia have been culled with care from periodicals and books of fact too numerous to specify the masculine costume the women wore in the morning rests on addison amiss 7ournal the london yourna gcnat mans magaixc for 1730 daily courant and other contemporaneous authorities which are full of detail the entire reversal of female costume in the evening rests also on contemporary books periodicals and pictures lord angleseys levee and toilet are put together from alists 7ournal and various passages in the pictorial iistory of england in my novel of  a simpleton  there is a dressmakers bill 1872 in  the wandering heir  there is a dressmakers bill i got the modern dressmakers bill by asking three or four ladies of my acquaintance to oblige me with the original accounts they did so i was about to pursue the same plan in  the wandering heir when i found to my disgust i could not raise the dead so i had to ransack libraries  the graves of those who cannot diecrahk i found the truth i wanted in  the book of costume or annals of fashion by a lady of rank the parsot of colebrook charges the best bred ladies of his day with gross ignorance i fowid that in numerous authoritieslady mary wortley montagues letters mrs stones  chronicles of fashion and alas in my own family letters before and after that date as for their bad spelling that continued long after the date of the parsons observations other ladies spelled phonetically besides miss tabitha bramble hat in england and ireland the men drank hardest but the women gambled most i gained from essays and plays of the time how dublin gentlemen lived i got from  barringtons memoirs  ireland sixty years ago c and how a dublin lady passed her time i got from swifts photographic verses which carry truth as plainly written on them as livy and tacitus carry falsehood if i could have raised three ladies of dublin from the dead i would not have troubled swift but i cant raise the dead any more than mr home can and i have no personal experience of the year 1730 so i took the only remaining source of truth and interwove printed but reliable fact with my figment the possession then of scholarship which gives judgment taste and discernment strength of treatment clearness of vision fidelity of portraiture fidelity of incident the careful study of art the life of action truth in factsthese are qualities which seem by themselves to justify a place in the very first rank but there is still more i think as i have already said that the collected volumes of reades novels present a more complete picture of english modern life than can be found in the works of any other novelist there are separate novels by trollope hardy mrs oliphant sketches by laurence oliphant stories by miss mulock and plenty of others invaluable as pictures of contemporary manners and touching on portions of life outside the field of charles reade but not one has covered so wide an area or studied so carefully or represented so successfully the living moving struggling acting life i do not wish to set up comparisons between read and trollope or any other good writer to each his gifts it is however a very remarkable and suggestive thing about read that he cannot be compared you cannot lay hold of read here and of trollope there and compare their treatment he is absolutely unlike thackeray he bears no resemblance to dickens with blackmore hardy or george meredith the three who seem to me to come next to thackeray dickens and reade he has not one single point in common the impossibility of either comparing or classifying reade or of judging him from a critical point of view which admits any other writer is to my mind one of the strongest proofs of his excellence i propose next by way of illustrating these remarks to consider very briefly two of his works the first of these is one of his earliest christie johnstone it was written early in the fifties there was then as now a good deal of rubbish afloat among the uncritical that is to say the majority a few were trying to get art out of conventional groovesart of all kinds gets perpetually into grooves out of which it is the business of men with brains and clear eyes to drag it then there was a great deal of nonsense talked by certain followers of carlyle about mediaeval men and the decadence of modern times as if the present was not better than the past and there was a considerable quantity of ecclesiastical squabbling the meaning and importance of which is now happily quite forgotten and lost as is the way with this sort of foolishnessonly that more fool ishness of the same kind is always succeeding charles readei am not going to tell a good and wellknown story badlytakes his hero out of the city of babbledom right away

B6446,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it

contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin

tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,folklore_contra

B3969,['8613500'],  a pair of blue eyes a rair of blue eyes by thomas hardy author of  far from the madding crowd london c kegan paul and co the appearance of mr hardys first threevolume novel in a popular form may be made the occasion for another word of criticism on it mr hardys work is of that solid kind which bears and deserves repeated reading and repeated criticism there are no novelists of our time not excepting even george eliot who put more  brains more intellectual effort into their novels in the last resort all novelists must be paid by the interest of their results and a novelist like any other conscientious labourer may work very hard and yet not succeed in producing an interesting result it is for the general public to judge whether or not works of art are to their taste success is the test of that cardinal merit but there is another meritthe merit of setting up a high standard of artistic perfection and labouring dili gently to reach it the merit of earnest devotion to the higher aims of an art which deserves independent recognition and this merit mr hardy may fairly claim his novels may be said to have a narrower scope a more confined horizon than george eliots because hitherto at least he does not seem to have concerned himself with those problems of the influence of race creed or pursuits upon character which engage so much of the attention of the authoress of  daniel deronda and  middlemarch both novelists are intensely occupied with character but while george eliot studies chiefly the influence upon human beings of their  environment as the philosophers call it and chooses the setting of circumstance to illustrate this mr hardys object is rather to illustrate the influence of one human being upon another the interaction of characters without much regard to how those characters came to be what they are then too there is a vast difference in their way of presenting character to their readers the one is analytic the other is dramaticor rather perhaps we should say narrative george eliot finding her bands full with the exhibition of her various problems evades the labour of bringing out the manifold aspects of a character one by one as they appear to the personages of the story she takes the reader at once into full confidence as to the nature of an individual as soon as she introduces him or her perhaps this is necessary to enable ns to follow her subsequent keen analysis of the influence of circumstances at any rate it is an economy of strength it saves the artist many anxious considerations of construction now so far as an ontside critic can judge these considerations form a large part of mr hardys labours as a novelist ihe labours to make his personages say and do things which mark their characters so unmistakably as not to need analytic comment to make them clear he leaves the discussion of their morality and the philosophic exposition of their motives to the personages themselves arid to his readers and critics his analysis is not served up raw it is incorporated with the story  a pair of blue eyes deals with very simple not to say hackneyed elementselements as old as human nature itself it is only a story of a charming young woman who falls in love with a young man promises to marry him remains faithful to her promise for some time while he seeks fortune abroad but contracts in spite of herself a still stronger passion for a man of greater force and weight of character after a struggle forsakes the old love for the new and pays a terrible penalty for her faithlessness elfride swancourt is the daughter of a country clergyman of an oldfashioned type their church is to be restoredi  awnd a young architect stephen smith is sent down to nelestow to make drawings his appearance is prepossessing mr swancourt takes to him greatly during the few days of his stay at the vicarage leaves hlim much alone with elfride and invites blin back naturally the young people fall in love but before stephen a youth of twenty obtains a promise from elfride he considers it his duty to tell herself arid her father that lie is the son of a mason in their own parish this at once changes the aspect of affairs she still loves him and will marry him at any sacrifice bat the father who had proved to stephen out of the landed gentry that lie was one of the fitzmaurice smiths and of a very old county family will imot hear of the match the two wise young persons lay their heads together and conclude that tile surest means of ensuring mutual constancy during the years of separation that must elapse before stephen makes lhis fortune is to mnarry before they separate elfride after much hesitation undertakes a journey with stephen for that purpose but at the last monient she hesitates turns and comes back without having the ceremony performed stephen goes to india and that is the end of act the first in act the second mr henry knight appears on the scene a barrister and essayist and the act is occupied with hiis gradual substitution in the affections of elfride in place of the image of the absent stephen it is not withsout a struggle that this substitntion is effected and mr hardy traces all the incidents of the struggle with the most patient and unerring art our readelrs will rememberthe skillwitli which george eliot analyses the changeful impulses that sway her gwendoline in daniel deronda now in one3 direction now in another mir hardys analysis is almost more elaborate and not less plausibly true to nature although lie never appears to be analysing but lets us see the various impulses at work and all the i time he never lifts the poetic nimbus from the head of his heroine not a word or an action of hers is out of tune with the keynote struck by the quotation on the titlepagea violet in the youth of prinmy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no prosepoet ever excelled mr hardy in justifying the ways of women we do not blame elfride although in the ordinary and safe language of everyday life she would be called a jilt we pity but do not blame being made to feel how inevitable it was that she should act as she did that in spite of her sense of duty the stronger man should supplant the weaker in her love we admit the danger of the principle as a rule of life we see mischief ahead in its applications but we do not blame elfride besides she suffers tragically for her want of truth when mir knighta somewhat impossible monster a man of thirtytwo who has never kissed a woman in his life except his own mother and has resolved that he will never marry unless he finds some girl who has never been in love beforediscovers that elfride has concealed her little episode with stephen which she did out of pure excess of love and fear lest she should lose her hero he roughly casts her off she marries another in careless despair but only to die a few months after her marriage mir hardy with proper respect for art does not obtrude physiological considerations but at various points in the story he records without insisting upon certain consumptive symptoms and we are left to infer that the excitement of her troubled experiences of love were too much for her fragile constitution every chapter in mir hardys novels proclaims him a masterly analyst of character who does not wield a scalpel but resembles rather those daring pathologists of the middle ages who saw by direct vision into the interior of the human mechanism he possesses the negative quality common to all the greatest masters in our literaturethe absence of cynicism there is not a trace of cynicism in his novels lie can draw cynical characters but his own outlook is from a different standpoint even the cynic he draws with the same unfailing sympathy and tenderhearted consideration with which he regards the rest of the personages that lie puts in motion on his wellappointed
