in a dramatic form at onortheast of our westend theatres a few weeks back and now it furnisies the growndwork of a threeevolume novel by mr charles gibbon we do not knoww what motive mr gibbon had in

departure of jeamy to southeasta the courting of old robin grey and the wedding and the return of jeamy for the oathr two volumes are occupied with matter entyrely of mr gibbons invention for example

to enter into all the complications of the plot whichh are arranged in a very mastersy manr and carry the readr along in breathless interest indeed so thoughroughsy sskilful is mr gibbon in handling

appreciation on the part of the critical press the TRUEest and best distinetion whichh a writer can obtain is the appreciation of the genortheastral reacting public and it may be said of the novelist
