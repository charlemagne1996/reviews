awestruck whisper the hardly credited information that  they were all done by and i canvas coloured to order heads arms and legs grouped by machinery and pictures turned out by the gross was what inartistic experiences had evidently suggested to the  untutored mind as the natural order of things les extremes southeast touchent our experience tends to a rooted belief in the existence of a class of machinemade novels and our admiration is hardly second to that of the traditional old lady from whom we quote when we meet with one bearing unmistakeable traces of handwork whatever heresies may obtain concerning critics it is nevertheless a fact that to be able as in the present instance to pronounce a novel original in conception artistic in treatment and thoroughly readable as a result does afford the reviewer most genuine satisfaction but we must sketch the story which has won from us so warm a meed of praise and in so justifying our opinion we shall be doing no injustice to the reader since to indicate the plot is to show the least charm of the book it illustrates the laureates ideal being the story of a boys  maiden passion for a maid which in the end  makes a man of him it is a tale of true love begun in earliest childhood and beset by almost every possible social obstacle richard talbot the son of squire talbot of talbot tower is the hero and when we ae first introduced to him on a visit to his grandmother lady earnshaw he is a wrelldrawn and very loveable specimen of an etonian of seventeen something of the schoolboy something too perhaps of the scapegrace and certainly all the loveableness cling to him throughout his history his father leads the life of a religious recluse stiriving to  live down  the sins of a dissolute youth and between the morbid man and thc highspirited boy there is much love but little sympathy necessarily thrown much for companionship into the society of grooms and gamekeepers dick naturally develops his strongly inherited instincts for their pursuits and perhaps quite as naturally falls boyishly in love with the bright beautiful little daughter of george parkes a gentleman whose antecedents are hardly worthy even of his present position in the squires preserves lucy and  master richard  are about the same age and some episodes of the  calflove stage are prettily sketched a kiss however which is exchanged and overlooked in most humorous circumstances brings affairs to the knowledge of the elders and to the consequent parting friends of course interfere  the clergyman and his wife and dicks  cousins and his aunts and even his own especial chum  pussy greene all protest in their several ways against the impossibilities ot such a marriage and finally the girl herself gives back her troth for a village maiden of seventeen it may be objected that she evinces quite exceptional gifts of sense and resolution  and we are afraid that the wisdom and tenderness which events subsequently show her to possess might be deemed exceptional in a maiden of any degree but it is nevertheless a consistent character throughout and a very charming one dick  gets over it to all appearance and goes to college is somewhat wild and reckless and when ha comes into his fortune contrives to dissipate it with alarming rapidity but through it all it is evident that the rare capability  to love one maiden only and to cleave to her is his and and in the end they marry and are as happy in spite of all drawbacks as such true love deserved the social complications which ensue on their marriage are extremely well told but hardly admit of quotation  handwork however is as evident in the sketching of the minor characters as in the distinct portraits of the hero and heroine we took an especial fancy to lucys good ugly

evidence than the authors word of possessing a sense of humourthat precious gift which makes even ruffians endurable to him who possesses it and the absence of which in the gentler sex is the cause of no little of their unhappiness and discontent v ii p 171 we have no space to particularise or to quote from the other dramatis personae it is emphatically a novel worth reading and not the least of its attractions to us is the fact of ita being true to its title pessimism in so many forms ia fashionable nowadays that it is pleasant to be reminded in a roundabout way that we are after all less black than were painted the novelist in these times finds a larger audience than even the popular preacher and it is refreshing to find one occasionally who is not unmindful of his responsibilities and who holds the wholesome theory that in the long run  beauty of form has but a short start of cleverness and but a little longer one of goodness which once having overtaken it in the affections moves on with strides that the other can never rival v i p 59 we call this healthy doctrine and it is worked out without a suspicion of preaching which indeed would destroy the effect but as a set off against the detestable aubumtressed heroines from whom we so often suffer and who seem to rely mainly on their back hair and their bigamous tendencies for our sympathy the novel which makes a lucy

readers of that tae that they would be likely to make progress in one of two directions that of an increase of romantic interest in the composition of the narrative or of a completer suborda tion of this element to the political and religion specs lations which found utterance in their former work though these are not wanting in the present novel which preserves the leading characteristic of the last reversee for true goodness and contempt for hypocrisy the advnce is mainly in the first direction the plot is original a might be expected and mainly hinges upon a very snmgular misunderstanding the position of the heroine  my little girl is an anomalous one she is the ward of a man who is not only unmarried but young enough to love her and to inspire a reciprocal attachment when the charming lollie is at last unmistakably grownup this fact of their mutual love is by no means clear to either party their relation has hitherto been that of tutor and pupil and no other has suggested itself to their minds hartley venn however now begins to have an uneasy sen sation that his ward had better be married and that of course he shall be glad to see her married the expression of this feeling on his part combined with the girls own unconsciousness of the real nature of her affection for her guardian produce a singular result the conversation in which after a consultation with his sister he propounds his plan for the happiness of his  little girl is worth quoting  and so after a long talk with my sister    she gave meo lollie the answer to the question i have been troubling myself with for so long she says my child that there is only one way you must be comfortably and honourably married her very words  i mr venn  the girl looked up and laughed in his face with those merry blue eyes of hers  what have i done that i must be married    doiit raise difficulties lollie he said in a feeble way after all the trouble we had in getting sukey to give us a right answer too   she laughed again i suppose i am not to be married unless i like why noi suppose not no oh certainly not but you will like wont you  and who am i to marry  why you see lollie he grew confidential  the fact is i dont know jones wont do    oh dear no he is tootooundignified mr lynn certainly not is there any one else  not at present my child but we shall see let us lok around us london is a great place if london wont do there is all england besides the rest of great britain berwickoftweed and the colonies after this expression of her guardians wishes regarding her settlement in life lollie falls in with the wicked hero  of the book philip durnford who eventually persuades her though she is not the least in love with him to run away with him as a pleasant surprise to the kiad guardian who was so anxious to see her married the unconscious lovemaking between hartley venn and his ward is so prettily described that this wild step of poor lollies is almost as great a shock to the reader as we may suppose it to have been to mr venn the marriage ia which  the little girl  has entangled herself is further a mock marriage devised by a very welldescribed and decidedly original character a drunken old scotch domifie who has  gone to the bad  with great energy and perseverance and employs himself in assisting philip durnford to take the downward course it would be unfair to eto the circumstances

stories that have sppyted this season aajy w   a d  i my little girl a novel by the authors of  ready money m ortiboy tinsley brothers there is decided originality in this work and on the whole it is very considerably above the average the interest howvever is less dependent on the story itself or the characters introduced than on certain adjunctsit might almost be said on the numerous digressionswhich though they may impede the course of the narrative certainly render the work what it is a production of marked power interest and individuality in a word the writers excel more in description than in the construction and elaboration of a plot less in telling a story or delineating character than in delineating certain phases of life and philosophising in a tone which if slightly cynical is indisputably fresh and suggestive the story opens effectively in the island of palmiste better known as prince georges island and after a few pages of brilliantlywritten descriptive matter we find ourselves transported to the estate of fontainebleau where george durnford an excavalry officer is discovered sorrowing for the early and sudden loss of his wife adrienne suddenly there appears on the scene a young mulatto woman marie wyname formerly durnfords mistress who having come for the purpose of triumphing over his sprrow ultimately relents and leaves the house with the intention of proceeding to europe where having a fine voice she purposes adopting the musical profession it is at this point that the story really commences the novel concerning itself for the most part with the fortunes of george durnfords two sons phil the illegitimate child of marie and arthur the heir to the estates an evil genius of a somewhat commonplace type is introduced in the form of a mr macintyre a scotch tutor who by means of forgery professes to establish phils legitimacy and amongst other villanies celebrates what is intended to be a mock marriage between his worthless protege and the  little girl lollie from whom the story derives its title phil durnford a black sheep first an officer in a line regiment then a gambler a  welsher and a drunkard ends his days in the island of palmiste to which he returns in desperation and where he dies in his mothers arms arthur a weak indecisive quixotic and rather colourless character falls under the imperious sway of madeleine de villeroy vwo born in the island of palmiste becomes on visiting england an enthusiast in the cause of the poor to whose relief and moral elevation she devotes herself body and soul the little girl though discarded by phil durnford who rudely tells her that she is only his mistress is eventually righted and on the whole the narrative is brought to a satisfactory con clusion undeniably there are dull pages in the book the meetings of the  chorus and jones nonsense verses for instance being far from interesting but broadly speaking the novel is one to be read and in spite of its somewhat unengaging characters and loosely constructed plot has the very decided merit of being written in a pure vigorous manly style the dialogue occasionally reaches to brilliancy there are bursts of true eloquence there are many descrip tive passages of great beauty there are some highly dramatic and effective situations the authors write from head and heart not ftop s memory stocked with other peoples ideas they have a command of genuinse pathos and it is hard to read such passages as those descriptive of lollies wanderings phils death and the shipwreck unmoved the language too is always goodterse vigorous and free from affectation and no fault can be found with the work on the score of its moral tone which is undeniably pure and elevated as we remarked before the strength of the collaborateurs seems to be in description rather than invention some of the incidents being forced and the characters acting at times in an unreal spasmodic fashion but the work displays considerable knowledge of life in its various phases and is most remarkable for its genuine literary and brain power earnestness and originality  my little girl is decidedly a remarkable production and as such wve commend it to the attention of readers who prefer something more bracing than the con ventional twaddle of the circulating library a peculiar feature of the book are the headings to the chapters often wooden and seldom very correctly drawn they have yet a subtle charm being full of grace quaint humour and delicate suggestiveness,dom_contra

amiable and win golden opinions at golden prices her conduct with respect to napoleons family however every one of whom hated her proves that she had some genuine good in her she never attempted revenge but appears to have been uniforinly disposed to soothe and conciliate the very persons to whom she doubtless at last owed her divorce it was his own family who were perpetually urging him

concluding notice we have already expressed our admiration of this book in terms more strong than wve are wont to use and do not think it necessary although we have dissented from dr meniess opinions inore than once to remind the reader of this fact wvitb a serious face we proceed to select from the elegant picturegallery with which the author has furnished uis such situations as inay of themselves tell the story of josephine we left lber kneeling in the triumph of completed hope tempered with all the delicacy and gentleness of her nature we reproduce her in the daily routine of grandeur unchanged unspoiled  we may well conceive the vexations occasioned by this host of petty observances to those sturdy veterans who wvere more conversant with the battlefield than the boudoir doubtless however the ridicule which has attached to the mianners of napoleons court has been greatly exaggerated and from evident design in writings published by renegade courtiers since the restoration we bave josephines own authority whose judgement and taste are indisputable that the emperor himself from the first observed with ease the habitudes of his rank m ost ccrtainly such are her own words when conversing in the little circle of her own exiled court  most truly do i regard the emperor as a man who has no equal in camps at the council board they find him extraordinary but in the interior of his palace he ever appeared to me still more remarkable i contess that notwithstanding my experience of the world and its usages the commencement of the imperial forms embarrassed me the emperor on the contrary made a sport a pleasure of them and in all the palace lie alone beyond contradiction best understood their observances lannes who enjoyed full licence of speech made mockery of what he termed  the hypocrisies of political worship  but estimatint such things at their real value the emperor regamds them under relations more elevated and conceives that in the eyes of the people they conduce to restore to powrer the majesty and ascendency which so many years of anarchy had destroyed he grants in truth that their principal influenice springs from the personal qlulities of those invested with the supreme rule but he maintains that without equalling or superseding these qualities ceremonial institutions may supply their place with advantage in supporting sluch a system napoleon shows himself at least veery disinterested for wvho can stamid less in need of appliances to impose tipon men than one who seems born to govern  in proof of his argument he adduces the example of a crowd of princes who have reigned so to speak rather seated or lying than standing upright but whose couch glrken by the barriers of etiquette has been respected like al sanr tnarv   of these views added josephine  i did not altogether approve but submitted to them  and indeed her whole czonduct showed that whatever tended to substittite torm for sentiment or ilace restraint upon intercourse vitli those arounl her gave her pain iei eleva tizn so far tended to her unhappiness that it placed in solitary greatness above the kindly glow of equal alfections a heart w hose first desire was to be loved in this sense bhe migtht hiae said  never lid subject long to he a queen as i 10 long and wish to lie a subject at the commencement of the empire the etiquette of which she chiefly complained was that which obliged her to remain seated while she received those who had lately been her equals or even her superiors in raulk nothizg could be more amiable than her reception of those ladies who came to take the oaths of fidelity on receiving ap pointments inl the imperial household she took care to remove all ostentatious ceremonywas usually accompanied only by her first lady of honourtalked to the neophyte who was often an old acquaintance of their former intimacy or on such topics as might render less sensible the difference between their present station and make the whole pass as an agreement between two friends to love each other this condescension extended even to her humble domestics yet never degenerated into undignified familiarity or absence of selfpossession as the following little incident testifies on the very first occasion of her leaving st cloud for a distant excursion as empress josephine traversed a whole suite of apartments though pressed for time to give directions to a very subaltern person of her household on returning the grand steward remonstrated very respectfully on thus compromising the dignity of the crown and that her majesty should give orders through him the empress upon this gaily replied you are quite right my good sir and such neglect of etiquette might be altogether inexcusable in a princess born to a throne and trained to the restraints which it imposes but have the goodness to recollect that i have enjoyed the felicity of living so many years as a private individual and do not take it amiss if i sometimes venture to speak kindly to my servants without an interpreter there is something excessively winning in that lurk ing childishness which sometimes breaks out so fascina tingly in woman and nowhere have we seen a more charming exemplification of the remark than in this little anecdote no wonder then setting apart her affection that josephine on all occasions evinced so strong a desire to be permitted to accompany her husband on his part napoleon loved to indulge this wish and they differed only as to its being always possible on one occasion however after promising to take the empress something having occurred to alter his intention and to require speed he resolved on departing privately without his companion fixing accordinigly one oclock in the morning the hour wheel she was most likely to be asleep for the timne of setting out he was just about to step into the carriage whene josephine in most piteous plight threw herself into his arms by some means she had obtained itiformation of what was going forward and called her wom en but impatient of any delay had got up without waitingt for them and throwing about her the first drapery she could lay hands upon had rushed down stairs in slippers without stockings  wveeping as our authority an eyewitness expresses it  like a little girl when the hzolidlays are over a moment later and napoleon would have been off like lightning bit he could rarely withstand the tears of his wife so placing her along the bottomr of the carriage he covered her with his travelling pelisse giving orders himselftabout tile clothes antd proper attendants of the empress but we nust have a peep at her domestic privacy and that was elegrant andl refihied as her public appearances were remote from hollow pretemisioni  from about midday till halfpast two or three oclock was passed by the empress in her apartments working conversing and reading with her ladies we have already mnentionedl how beautifully josephine embroidered anrd this accomplishment continuied to be her chief amusement much of the most sllendid furniture ill the various palaces beingo covered with piecers executed by her own hand with the a3ssistane of her ladies the following billet is a curious melange of orders pertaining to these labours while it shows how kindly josephine addressed even her inferior attendwatts  to aubert femine le cambzce to iec emprencss my dear miss auberti beg you will call in at bennais on returning and see if he really intends to bring my rouge boxes i have not a single one as you know inquire also whether the frames which i ordered of him are ready my ladies remain with folded arms and i myself have nothing at all to do take at the same time in your way the pare de familke and get there on myx account a complete assortment of worsteds with some dozens of english needlesliere is a lot of commissions for you all at once not to forget them think of me i am quite sure you will acquit yourself well and return quickly  while the rest were at work one of the ladies permanently appointed to the office of reader read aloud at such times as conversation was not preferred when any literary production gave more than usual pleasure it was immediately begun from the commencement and perused a second time the volumes selected were interesting but useful books from the standard writers arid all new publications of repute works of taste and imagination constituted of course a large portion of these public readings novels however unless in particular instances were excluded napoleon indeed disliked to see novels anywhere about his palaces anti traversing the antechambers if he found any of his attendants reading he seldom failed to examine the book andif a novel condemned it to the flames without mercy the individual too was sure of a lecture which usually began with the question so you could find no better reading than that while the empress and her ladies were engaged as described the emperor was in the habit of looking in upon the fair party at intervals throughout the morning on these occasions he is described as being extremely amiable amusing and iii high spirits for he rarely visited the saloon in the morning unless when in good humour or in his own phrase w hen things wvent well josephine too though more rarely would venture into his cabinet but when he required her presence for any conference of importance napoleon knocked at the little door of private communication the empress joyfully obeyed the signal and these interviews generally taking place in the evening were often continued so long that on returning she found all her ladies asleep the masquerading adventures of the imperial pair are highly characteristic  the winter of 1808 was one of the gayest which paris had yet witnessed under the empire miaskel balls were especial favourites and those of the ambassador for the new kingdom of italy were particularly listitiguished for their splendour napoleon contrlary to his usual nrejudice against such disguisements resolviiig to be present arid to dance at one of these ordered ten different dresses to be carried into the apartment allotted to him these were ill

had changed her costume and despite all his precautions recognised napoleon by his foot and boot a favourite amusement of josephine and napoleon wats a game called  l1isoinerstbe same as what our schoolboys call  french and euglisl or  deals there is somethinig very striking in the account of the last opportunity they had of indulging in this relaxation time interval between the lath of august and the 27th of september when the interview at erfurtlh took place was passed chiefly at st cloud and might nearly be called the last of josephines happiness in napoleons society only a few days

ilestined for declaring his final determination to josephine she had wept all day they were to dine together as usual and to conceal her tears the empress wvore a large rwhite hat fastened under the chiii which wvith its deep front shaded the whole of the utpper part of the face napoleon also had shown marks of the strongest agitationi he scarcely spoke to any one but with arms folded continued at intervals to pace his library alone from time to time a convulsive movement attended with a hectic flush passed for an instant across his features and at table when he raised his eye it was only to look by stealth upont the empress with an expression of the deepest regret the dinner was removed untouchednieither tasted a morsel and the only use to which napoleon turned his knife was to strike mechanically upon the edge of his glass which lie appeared to dlo unconsciously and like one whose thoughts were painfully lireoccupied every thing during this sad repast seemed to presage the impending catastrophe the officers of the court even who were in attendance stood in motionless expectancy like men who look upon a sight they feel portends evil though what they know not not a sound was heard beyoiid the noise of placing and removing the untasted viands and the monotonous tiiikling already noticed  for the emperor spoke only once to ask at question without giving any attention to the reply  we dined together as usual says josephine  i struggled with my tears which notwithstanding every effort overflowed from iny eyes i uttered not a single word during that sorrowful mneal and

with him we have already described the manmier of napoleons taking coffee after dinner the change which on this day first took place seemed to indicate to josephiue that her cares were no longer indispensable to the happiness of her husband she had risen as usual from table with napoleon whom she slowly followed into the saloon and with a haiidkeichief pressed tipon her mouth to restrain the sobbing which though inaudible shook her whole frame recovering by an effort her selfcommand josephinte piepared to ptour out the coffee when napoleon advancing to the paige performed the office for

himself taking a taper from the chimnueypiece lighted the vay through a dark passage whence there was a private stair to the empresss sleepingroom at first he had merely said that she had had ai nervous attack but in his increasing agitation allowed some expressions to escape whenice the count first clearly perceived the nature of josephines calamity when they had thus attained the private

park the empress and her suite retired to dress for dinner to which never less than from twelve to fifteen strangers sat down the evening passed in amusement conversation aud music and was always very gay owving to the number of visitors from paris at eleven tea ices and sweetmeats there served and at midnight the empress retired the apartments in which these reunions took place were elegant and spacious the furniture being covered with needlework on a ground of white silk wrought by the empress and her ladies but the residence altogether was small an inconvenience still farther increased through josephines veneration of every thing that had been napoleons the apartment which he had occupied remained exactly as he had left it she would not suffer even a chair to be moved and indeed very rarely permitted any one to enter keeping the key herself and dusting the articles with her own hands on the table was a volume of history with the page doubled down where he had finished reading beside it lay a pen with the ink dried on the point and a map of the world on which he was accustomed to point out his plans to those in his confidence and which still showed on its surface many marks of his impatience these josephine would not allow to be touched on any account by the wall stood napoleons campbed without curtains and above continued to bang such of his arms as he had placed there on different pieces of furniture were flung various portions of apparel just as he had used them last for among his other extraordinary ways he had a practice on retiring to rest of flinging rather than taking off his clothes casting down a coat here a vest there usually pitching his watch into the bed and his hat and shoes into the farthest corner of the apartment last scene of all  all these grievances preyed upon josephines spirits but without producing any appearance of disease till the 4th of may when she dined at st leu faith hortense eugene and the emperor of russia on returning to m almaison she felt a general uneasiness which however yielded to some gentle medicine and the empress resumed her ordinary occupations though evidently without the usual enjoyment some days after lord beverley with his two sons breakfasted at malmaison and to this nobleman josephine expressed herself warmly on the generosity of the english who at that time she said alone spoke of napoleon in a becoming manner she complained bitterly of the ingratitude of those who not satisfied with abandoning his falling fortunes overwhelmed his memory with calumny on the 10th alexander with several distinguished foreigners dined at malmaison josephine despite a headache and cold shiverings which she laboured to conceal did the honours of the table and in the evening attempted even to take a part in a game of  prisoners on the beautiful lawun in front of her residence how many painful associations must have connected themselves with this amusement both mind and body unfitted her for such exercise and she wvas con strained to become a spectator but with such an altered appearance as to excite the alarm of her guests to these anxious enquiries however she continued to reply with a faint smile which belied the assurance  that she was only fatigued and would be well tomorrow tomorrowv came but josephine wvas evidently worse and for fourteen days her complaint without assuming any definite form or rendering absolute confinement necessary was frequently attended at night with fainting aind sometimes a wandering of the mind more from anxiety than delirium onthe 24th the empress had a slight attack of sore throat but otherwise rallied so much as to insist on receiving the emperor of russia amld the king of prussia woho were engaged to dine with her on th at  sia it dccordtsvivy t1  butt x forced to retire and hortense who never left malmaisoi during her mothers illness took her place at table thenceforward the disease assumed a most alarming cha racter of gangrenous quinsy and its progress became fearfully rapid on the morning of the 25th alexander returned and filled with anxiety at the alteration in josephines appearance requested permission to send his owvn physician this the empress declined but from that day she was attended by her own and the two physicians attached to the households of her sotl anal daughter on the night of the 2627th a blister was applied between the shoulders and sinapisms to the feet but though these gave some relief from pain they effected no impression on the disease still josephine with the same angelic swveetness which had marked her whole life endeavoured by concealing her suffering to soothe the anxiety of her surrounding friends from the morning of the 26th she appears to have been perfectly sensible of her danger for looking then steadily upon the phy sician and perceiving his alarm she silently pressed his hand in token of consciousness and acquiescence she even took an interest in her former occupations and on the 27th when informed that the celebrated flowerpainter redoubt6 had come to draw two fiavourite plants in flower she sent for him extended her hand then pushed him gently away saying  you must not catch my sore throat for next week this was on wednesday  i hope to see you advanced with a fresh masterpiece the preceding night had passed in a lethargic sleep and at ten in the morning of the 28th the physicians after consulting deemed it proper to prepare eugene and iihitense for the final change from those two cherished beings whom she had loved so truly josephine heard a communication which thus lost all its i bitterness with pious resignation she received the last  rites of the itomish faith fiom the ministration of her grandchildrens preceptor for the parish clergyman of ruel happened to be absent late on the same day the emperor alexander arrived and was shown into the chamber of the sufferer now evidently approaching the goal of all her sorrows by the bed of their mother knelt eugene and ihortense too deeply moved to address the emperor but at sight of a monarch whom she regarded with gratitude josephine seemed to acquire renewed strength made a sign for all to approach and said at least i shall lie regretted i have always desired the happiness of france i did all in my power to contribute to it and i can say with truth to all of you now present at my last moments that the first wife of napoleon never caused a single tear to flow these were her last words for she fell immediately after into a slumber which continued interrupted by a scarcely audible sigh till halfpast eleven on the morning of the 29th of miay wvhen her gemitle spirit calmly passed to a world of love and peace we began with some notion that we would attempt a profound and critical appreciation of josephines real merit her fascinations have been too much for uswe could as soon attempt to criticise the woman we love,dom_contra
B2596,['9458182'],  macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful

B2450,['6690649'],  buried alive or ten years of penal srvi tude in siberia by fedor dostoyeffiky translated from the russian by marie von thilo longmans the recent death of the author of notes from the dead house and the striking demonstrations of respect with which his funeral has been attended at st petersburg invest with a special interest just now the english version of that remarkable work published under the title of buried alive the descriptions of prison life in siberia which it contains are well worthy of being widely read serving as a useful corrective to the sensational accounts of siberian horrors which certain french writers of fiction delight in producing the principal drawback to the real merits of buried alive is that it is impossible to say what part of it is fact and what is fiction the author of the book really spent four years as a convict in a siberian prison and the sketches which he has produced are no doubt faithful to life still they have not the value which they would have possessed if he had recorded without modification what he really saw and heard during his time of bondage it must be remembered also that thirty years have elapsed since he was con demned to penal servitude and in this interval many reforms have been effected mr lansdell whose account of a recent visit to many of the siberian prisons was published in the contemporary review last october found them  in a much better condition than is generally supposed he states that the food per week given to a hard labour convict at kara is nearly double in weight that which is given to a convict in england and the amount of indulgences accorded to a siberian klatorjnik might deservedly render jealous a prisoner at dartmoor or portland dreary indeed is the lot of an english malefactor who has fallen into the hands of the law compared with that of his siberian brother whose imprisonment is alleviated by tobacco and enlivened by strong drink and gambling not to speak of the possibility of an occasional flirtation and the probability of a yearly theatrical performance at christmas among professional criminals therefore buried alive may give rise to grumbling but by other persons it will probably be perused with interest of the translation it is not necessary to say much having been made by a russian ladyit is sufficiently correct so far as descriptions of fact are concerned but the authors reflec tions at the beginning of each chapter have been rather paraphrased than translated the statement is somewhat puzzling on p 234 that the soldier on duty who looked at a convicts corpse being moved by a sudden impulse took off his sword and helmet and crossed himself a reference to the original explains that the soldier unfastened his chinstrap then took off his helmet and crossed himself a phrase in the description of the prison soup appearing suspicious it also was compared with the original the author is made to say  i used at first to be horrified at the numbers of black beetles floating about in it but my fellowprisoners evidently thought that they imparted an additioxalfavour to the soup and never took any notice of them the words which we have italicised are the gratuitous contribution of the translator or reviser the author writes simply and concisely the interpreter preters a more ambitious style for instance the words there were here murderers by accident and murderers by profession brigands and brigand chiefs are expanded into  there were among us criminals of all kinds and classes beginning with the man who had slain his adverary in a moment of blind fury and the highway robber and ending with the coldblooded murderer who delighted in the deathstruggles of his victim after mentioning that more than onehalf of the prisoners could read and write and that someone had used the fact as an argument to prove that education demoralises the masses the author says in the translation  the cause of the terrible depravity of our lower classes must be sought for elsewhere he really never said a word about the terrible depravity of the russian lower classes a depravity in which he did not believe he merely said  there are quite different causes for that ie for crime although it must be admitted that reading and writing produce seltsufficiency among the people but surely that is not altogether a fault xu id q id w r s ralbton,dom_contra

this occurred at the commencement of the french revolution and to get out of the way of impending danger the beverleys remove to rome where in a few weeks the young man is found murdered and on examining his papers his connexion with mademoiselle davrancourt is discovered the lady is understood to be in the family way and to save the scion of their son no time is lost in flying to paris

powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the

the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was

steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman

B8740,['4358623'],  the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the author succeeded in the delineation  the queens manes a romauce of holyrood by g j whyte mielvle two tols parker so  bourn of historical character on the contrary the representatiobs which appear on his canvas are daubs or caricatures the wise and politic rtandolpha worthy ambassador even for queen elizabethbecomies a conceited dancingmaster the character of bothwell has been borrowed from the pretentious doggerel which mvr aytoun published some years ago under the name of a poem the borderer is delineated as from the first the unselfish lover of his queen  anl the brutality and cowardice which he displayed when he hat won the object of this pure devotion are glossed over in grandiloquent and meaningless sentences such as these 1the nman who would once have shed his hearts blood freely to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work there is nothing in the booknot even incident instead of the usual huntingfield with its impossible leaps we have a hawkingparty on the links of saint andrews composed of the queen and john knox than which we never read of anything more absurd these two volumes in short are as dull less authentic and far more lengthy than any record of the same period they have nothing of

fulfil it is tame prosy and flat it is plain that lady fullerton wants the power to sustain her characters evenly from their entrances to their exits they move with convulsive starts like the fantoccini who are guided by strings held behind the curtain and not like men who move by an impulse from within she conceives with much truth and correctness the personages of her story but she wants the skill to embody herconceptions and conduct them consistently to the end she does not sufficiently indiridualize she paints classes rather than persons and as if conscious of the defect she tries to hide it by attaching to them something discordant and unnatural and which she effects so clumsily that the patchwork is visible at a glance thus her hero edmund ne ille mingles qualities which are nesver combined in real life because they are in fact antagonistic and one can only exist where the other is not the heroine genevra leslie is the most perfect character in the storythat is to say the most true to nature but there are difficulties in her conduct which can only be explained away by resorting to some farfetched explanations the plot turns on the marriage of the hero with the heroine under peculiar circumstancesthe papa of the former being a staunch protestant andl threatening to disinherit his son if ever he should marry apapist and the latter beingas is i usual in novels just the very person whom he  was forbididen to marrythat is to say the i daughter of a colonel leslie by a w ife who had died in italy leaving the young lad to be brought up there in the bosom of the romish church the concealment of this inauspicious marriage and its consequences forms the very stale material out of which the plot of grantley manor is woven the result the reader must seek in the

analysing the combinations of familiar objects which bear the nameand the form alsoof novelties perhaps there are few tacts proved by such a multitude of singular and varied instances as the smallness of the number of inventions thus though to a careless reader the two books may appear to be little more connected by relationship than some of dear mrs nicklebys allusions we have been haunted while perusing grantley manor by thoughts of miss austens inimitable  emma though the one contain the tragedy and the other the everyday comedy of domestic lifethough in the first the persons are all heroic not to say highflown whereas in the latter they are so commonj place that we wonder at our own care for them  the intrigues ofthe two stories and the groups  of characters in both bear a resemblance curious j in proportion to our being convinced that it was unpremeditated the gay childlike heroine of lady georgianas work has been watched lessoned and cared for by a monitor older than herselfan old family friend whom she loves and who loves her because neither can help it rather than because either wishes it meanwhile she fancies herself sought by a younger and gayer suitor whose pursuit is merely a piece cf acting played otf to conceal his secret connexion with the graver and more impassioned binevraa lady of many mysteries all but rmencted into thc madhouse or the coffin by the

heroineand moreover a stranger to her she is also a devout catholic her religion being the reason why her lover who  belongs to a redhot orange family first wishes their intercourse hidden lest by its being known he should lose his inheritanceand then proposes to her apostasy as the condition of its continuance those who recollect ellen middleton will readily conceive the power with which our authoress avails herself of such 1111 terials mis burney herself in the last volume of  cecilia was not more merciless to the deposed heiress than lady georgiana is to ginevra this very stringency meets the humour of the daywhich is to seek for stimulants whatever the price we are not sure however  that permanency of reputation may not go to make up the payment  since it is the mirth and sarcasm and fine observation of character contained in  cecilia which make that novel a classic and not the scenes in the lodginghouse no nor even the coup dc theatre which the johnsons and thralls

vmitty manor a tale by lady georgiana ful icrton authoress of ellen middleton three vols moxon ellen middleton was a very clever a very fascinating book a first effort in fiction deserving of all praise but it was open to many critical objections and was chiefly remarkable for its great promise it showed a depth of observation on which we remarked at the time the power of sustaining a strong and simple interest a taste for homely portraiture and a wholesome contempt of the trivial allies of what is called fashionable life but there as too much wretchedness with insufficient motive jfrl too much explanation of what motive there was r a direct straightforward interest with what ms to be an effort to be miserable it is difficult to sympathize and when people are always analysing their

selfdenying he has been by her side from infancy till now and father mother sister all the strong and tender ties of life are to her expressed in the patient affection of old walter his lessons have strengthened and ennobled every finer feeling and impulse and might have made her a perfect character and grantley sfanor a less interesting book but for her fond old grandfather and silly mrs thornton but let us introduce her to the reader as she rides over to this worthy couple a few mornings after her fathers arrival  margarets spirits rose as she galloped across the park and drew near to the iron gate which separated it from the grounds of the vicaragehouse and when she came in sight of the house itself every smallpaned window every smoking chimney every laurel bush aeemed to give her a welcome the housedog barked furiously the gate swung merrily on its hinges the doorbell rung gaily a she approached and she jumped off her pony as lightly as if for three whole days she had not been measuring her words and glancing timidly at colonel leslies face with the secret conviction that he thought her a fool or a bore her grandfather who from his study had seen her arrive came hastily to the door kissed her cold blooming cheeks called her his darling child begged her not to stand in the draught and led her into the little drawingroom where his wife was employed at an endless piece oi tapestry work which had been as often unpicked as penelopes though not on as systematic a plan or with so deliberate a purpose margaret tenderly kissed her grandmother took the wellknown work out of her hands threw her own hat and whip on a couch settled herself in a low comfortable armchair threaded a needle and began working as if for her life   grandpapa she exclaimed in a moment  grandpapa i know now what the poor dogs feel when their muzzles are taken off  do you darline  how so    hare been muzzled for the last four days she returned with a nod and a smile that made her grandfather stoop down and kiss her forehead white he said   foolish child   ay grandsapa you say  foolish child  and it means  dear clever arling girl while my father says when i make a remark  very true my love and that means  i wish the girl would hold her tongue so much for the value of words  words my dear observed mrs thornton sententiously are only the signs of things  true grandmamma and certain things had better give no signs of life at all such as a father s aversion to his child she added with a tone of mingled emotion and resentment nonsense my love cried mr thornton  how could anybody have an aversion to you and still less your own father1 there is no accounting for aversions mr thornton observed his wife  ihave felt myself the mott inexplicable preferences for some people and dislikes for others i never could abide the sight of mary dickins mrs sydneys housemaid or of the young curate who did duty here last sunday  he squints grandmamma and mary dickins has a crooked mouth and a bottlenose cried margaret glancing at the opposite looking glass which certainly reflected an image illcalculated to inspire aversion excellent writing we thinkthe indication of character easy and distinct and the manner as unforced and unexaggerated but a most important person comes upon the scene at the vicarage walter brings in his young friend edmund neville in whom margaret had been interested by circumstances oonnacted with walter and when in company with the latter she rides away from the vicarage it is with a new and fluttering feeling

which walter responds with terrible emotion but ho recovers himself and the dialogue proceeds   leslie we never understood each other and now less than ever if you cannot conceive that i would rather

would have seen that it was unnecessary to warn him against laughing  the truth is plain to the reader by this time walter loves his little ward and pupil with more than a brothers or fathers love but she has to undergo her first heart sorrow and escape its feverish dream of fancied affection before she discovers either her own or old walter s truth we can not in detail describe how this is managed but it is managed most delicately not only with a perfect mastery over the feelings but with the nicest expression of all those seeming sudden contradictions in character which mark the ebb and flow

conscious of a joy like grief she longs to be alone and think  feeling suddenly frightened at the idea of seeing walter again  when walter as usual quietly enters and speaks to her of a letter she has had from one of her village proteges it is a love affair not unlike her own he advises as to the advice she should give it is not that which is in her heart  and she says so her answer half scares him with a vague strange hope and unconsciously he pleads his own case in that of the peasant  margarets tears were rollins slowly down hei cheeks but a smile was also on her lips as she said with her own peculiar tone of childish playfulness are you talking of riddell now old walter v and she laid her hand on his he started and said rapidly tell me dearest margaret for mercys sake tell me do you understand me 7do i understand you or have i been talking nonsense 1thinking aloud  it is all over now he said with an effort and then added with a mournful smile  i must have been dreaming i think  she pressed his hand and one of those bright tears fell upon it  o margaret do not be sorry for meif i have said too much and that you have guessed the truthdo not be sorry for me do not let a single thought of pain or of embarrassment disturb your gentle kindness my precious margaret my own dear child there are feelings which have their own reward and if i do indeed love you as never perhaps did any one love another before this is happiness in itself and enough for me that i have suffered i will not deny  but i have now seen you calm and bright again as if no cloud had ever darkened your peaceful life i have seen you turn with courage and patience to all though home duties and sacred charities of life i have teen that trial has purified without hardening your heart and i ara grateful

scarcely audible to any ears but histhat she loved him better than any one in the world  that she had sometimes thought so  that she was sure of it now his heart was beating so violently that he could scarcely utter but he subdued his own agitation to calm lers he took her hand between his and led her to the window the shades of evening had fallen and a few stars were beginning to shine on the face of the darkened skies the beautiful river like a silver ribbon was reflecting in its bosom the rays of the moon and not a breath of air disturbed thc silence of the scene for an instant they were

B3437,['3169911'],  the reds of the midi here is a historical novel such as we get only once in a very long time and in a translation so good as to balmost as much a rarity the author is a very distinguished provenalmy information i may as well confess is derived entirely from the prefacewho is at this moment capouliw that is official head of the fulibrige the society of provensal men of letters being second in succession to mistral he has written epics and lyrics and stories in prose and conspicuous among these wst is this tale of the march of the marseilles battalion to paris it is a very remarkable work it is literaturewhich not one such story in a thousand contrives to be but just because historical romance is fashionable now i should recommend it with a warning to those who read mr stanley weyman and his entertaining brothers and imitators in england it is not a budoir version of a rough chapter out of a rough and terrible time it is very real and very ungenteel the marseilles men did not fight in kid gloves nor save when they were shouting their songs or their stereotyped cries did they utter fine sentiments no one at all in this story is told gff to speak words of horror or deprecation or to adjust the balance so as to be quite fair all round it is made up of the recollections of a rude untaught peasant boy that marched with the battalion who had no theories but sang the marsellaise with greater faith than he had ever sung a litany no philosophy of any kind blurred what he actually saw his story is a peasants story and told to peasants there is a good deal to find fault with the incidents relating to the marquis dambrun and his family and surto and l jacarasse seem like a hallucination and that the wretches should stifler death by the very guillotine on which the child they had plotted to kill had innocently written her name is a straining after an artificial effect which is below the level of the rest but indeed the story does not much concern a reader though the characters do little pascalet margan and samat with his banner of the rights of man and his goodhumoured intolerance of anybody who would not applaud and look cheerful at

once it is men of the midi you have to do with all that long weary trudge to paris with momentary intervals of depression their tongues and their throats are making a deafening din with the carmagnole or their own hymn the exuberance of their spirits produces every appearance of disorder they are chattering excitable children the vitality of a northerner would have given out long before in mere waste emotion but these had enough and to spare there was method in their madness they reached paris and tired of waiting for the word of attack from the finnicking timid townsfolk they gave the word themselves that lost louis xvi his crown pascalet is a type of them lie is in despair about his extreme youth and will convince the whole world by his tremendous exertions that he is as good a man as any he smears his maiden chin with blackberries insists on being harnessed to the cannon that he may enter vienne with honour and dragging with might and main is delighted when a girl cries out  just look at that young fellow goodness how he frightens me  he thunders out big oaths with ostentation and never a single grumble in the fighting in paris he is both frightened and plucky he dances with joy when he finds a joint of his finger shot away and plays the fool and the man and the child all at once wvhat military excitement means to an eager boy bred in obscurity will probably never be better described but as i have maid the paris scenes are not for squeamish reader who will be shocked to find no words of protest from the simple men who having walked hundreds and hundreds of hungry miles to do a thing had done it and had faith they were right though they found that the advent of liberty meant unloosing a good many devils from hell there is one striking passage in the book

it and squirted it up through the two blowholes in the top of hi head and as there was an open hatchway just over his head the water all went into the sea again and that whale kept working day and

student when inclined to pessimistic misgivings about the lovely nature of the writing man exclaim  thank god we have stevenson and the savile club not even the sweetness of stevensons disposition could have saved him from friends like these had it not been for his stock of common sense of this sweetness of disposition and of this good sense we could quote many instances but let one suffice when  kidnapped appeared although in reviewing it we enjoyed the great pleasure of giving high praise to certain parts of that delightful narrative we refused to be scared by stevensons friends from making certain strictures it occurred to us that while some portions of the story were full of that organic detail of which scott was such a master and without which no really vital story can be told it was not so with certain othor parts from this we drew the conclusion that the book really consisted of two distinct parts two stories which stevenson had tried in vain to weld into one we surmised that the purely jacobite adventures of balfour and alan breck were written first and that then the writer anxious to win the suffrages of the general novelreader whose power is so great with byles the butcher looked about him for some story on the old lines that he experienced great difficulty in finding one ana that he was at last driven upon the old situation of the villain uncle plotting to make away with s  the nephew by kidnapping him and sending him off to the plantations the athenaum whose kindness towards all writers poets and prosemen great and small has won for it such an infinity of gratitude said this but in its usual kind and gentle way this aroused the wrath of the stevensonians yet we were not at all surprised to get from the author of kidnapped himself a charming letter from which the following sentences may be given   i wish to thank you for your notice of  kidnapped and that not because it was kind though for that also i valued it but in the same sense as i have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers  you who fight the good fight contending with stupidity and i would fain hope not all in vain  in my own case for instance surely not in vain what you say of the two parts in  kidnapped was felt by no one more painfully than by myself i began it partly as a lark partly as a potboiler  and suddenly it moved david and alan stepped out from the canvas and i found i was in another world but there was the cursed beginning and a cursed end must be appended and an old friend byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door so it had to go into the world one part as it does seem to me alive one part merely galvanised  no work only an essay for a man of tentative method and weak health and a scarcity of private means and not too much of that frugality which is the artists proper virtue the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden the days of professional literature very hard yet i do not so far deceive myself as to think i should change any character by changing my epoch the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves  and my  kidnapped  was doomed while still in the womb and while i was yet in the cradle to be the thing it is thoroughly characteristic of stevenson are these words and it is because of thisamiability of hisno less than on account of his talentsthat we sincerely hope he may leave that memory behind him which he toiled to leave and yet we tremble to think of the provoking way time has of making short work with novels for the fieldings scotts brontes thackerays dickenses and george eliots that survive think of the host whose very captains such as bulwer disraeli ainsworth g p r james wilkie collins trollope are half forgotten nor is the reason of this far to seek though it may not be exactly true that each generation demands to be represented by its own poet it seems that even in regard to poetry a live dog is better than a dead lion if his voice is attuned to the convolutions of the contemporary ear but it is largely true that in the widespreading valley of prose literature at the foot of parnassus each generation demands to be represented by its own novelists and turns away from all but the very few among the novelists of previous time for one great difference between a poem and a novel is undoubtedly this that a poem ho wsoever humble professes to be and is a work of art written primarily for the poets own delectation  offered indeed as a medium through which he would fain express that ego so dear to him but a novel howsoever full of literary qualities is primarily a manufacture for a marketa fact which scott frankly confronted though perhaps not quite so frankly as does the novelist of the present hour who improving even upon the advertising methods of the late illustrious author of  the mysteries of london instructs the interviewer or paragraphist in his or her employ to inform though world of the number of copies printed the rate of the royalty hisor her publisher allows per copy and the amount of the publishers chequedoes this as regularly as the directors of a jointstock business give their balancesheet to the world we have no quarrel with all this we merely state the fact that as patent soap mustard liver pills and novels are nowa days in the same category the manufacturers of these commodities must allow prince posterity to have his marketing done for himself we have been led to dwell at some length upon this subject through an embarrassing consciousness that what we are about to say upon stevensons work may vex and hurt those fervid and tooloving souls who as we have shown above are more stevensonian than stevenson himself let our excuse be that it is though aim of this journal and always has been to exercise a twofold function in criticism although its main business week by week has been to give an account and a brief criticism of the literature of the hour it has also aspired when occasion arose to take up a higher groundin a word it has aspired to deal with those laws of cause and effect in literary art which are unchangeable and eternal and when a place has been claimed for a contemporary writer in the classic literature of the world it has triedhonestly and faithfully tried according to its lights to find a proper place for him but then it must be remembered that in exercising these two functions it often becomes necessary to apply to one and the same writer canons of criticism of two opposite kinds that loose leniency of judgement which may he rightly exercised when the critic has only to balance one work of contemporary fiction with another would be quite out of place when in discussing an edition like this a writers entire works are confronted in order that his proper place may be found in the field of uni versal criticism take for instance the little story  dr jekyll and mr hyde the laudatory criticism upon which is in bulk as regards the story itself like the comets tail in relation to though comet on its appearance as a story a shilling shocker for the railway bookstalls the critics attention was directed to its vividness of narrative and kindred qualities and though perfectly conscious of its worthlessness in the world of literary art he might well be justified in comparing it to its advantage with other tories of its class and literary standing but when it is offered as a classicand this is really how it is offered  it has to be 1 udged by critical canons of a very different ind it has then to be compared and contrasted with stories having a like motive stories that deal with an idea as old as the oldest literatureas old no doubt as those primaeval days when man awoke to the consciousness that he is a moral and a responsible beingstories whose temper has always been up to now of the loftiest kind it is many years since in writing of the parables of buddhaghosha it was our business to treat at length of the grand idea of mans dual nature and the many beautiful forms in which it has been embodied we said then that from the lovely modern story of arsene houssaye where a young man starting along lifes road sees on a lawn a beautiful girl and loves her and afterwardswhen sin has soiled him finds that she was his own soul stained now by his own sin and from the still more impressive though less lovely modern story of edgar poe 4 william wilson up to the earliest allegories upon the subject no writer or storyteller had dared to degrade by gross treatment a motive of such universal appeal to the great heart of the  great man mankind we traced the idea as far as our knowledge went through calderon back to oriental sources and found as we then could truly affirm that this motivefrom the ethical point of view the most pathetic and solemn of all motiveshad been always treated with a nobility and a greatness that did honour to literary art manu after telling us that single is each man born into the world  single dies implores each one to collect virtue in order that after death he may be met by the virtuous part of his dual self a beautiful companion and guide in traversing that gloom which is so hard to be traversed fine as this is it is surpassed by an arabian story we then quoted since versified by sir edwin arnoldthe story of the wicked king who met after death a frightful hag for an eternal companion and found her to be only a part of his own dual nature the embodiment of his own evil deeds and even this is surpassed by that lovely allegory in arda yiraf in which a virtuous soul in paradise walking amid pleasant trees whose fragrance was wafted from god meets a part of his own dual nature a beautiful maiden who says to him 0 youth i am thine own actions and we instanced other stories and allegories equally beautiful in which this supreme thought has been treated as soetically as it deserves it was left for tevenson to degrade it into a hideous tale of murder and whitechapel mystery a story of astonishing brutality in which the separation of the two natures of the mans soul is effected not by psychological development and not by the awful alchemy of the spiritworld beyond the grave as in all the previous versions but by the operation of a dose of some supposed new drug if the whole thing is meant as a horrible joke in imitation of de quinceys  murder considered as one of the fine arts it tells poorly for stevensons sense of humour if it is meant as a serious allegory it is an outrage upon the grand allegories of the same motive with which most literatures have been enriched that a story so coarse should have met with the plaudits that dr jekyll and mr hyde met with at the time of its publication  that it should now be quoted in leading articles of important papers every few days while all the various and beautiful renderings of the motive are ignored  what does it mean is it a sign that the shrinkage of the world the solidarity of civilization making the record of each days doings too big for the day has worked a great change in our public writers  is it that they not only have no time to think but no time to read anything beyond the publications of the hour is it that good work is unknown to them and that bad work is forced upon them and that in their busy ignorance they must needs accept it and turn to it for convenient illustration  that stevenson should have been impelled to write the story shows what the  suicide club had already shown that underneath the apparent health which gives such a charm to  treasure island and kidnapped there was that morbid strain which is so often associated with physical disease had it not been for the influence upon him of the healthiest of all writers since chaucerwalter scottstevenson might have been in the ranks of those pompous problemmongers of fiction and the stage who do their best to make life hideous it must be remembered that he was a critic first and a creator afterwards he himself tells us how critically ho studied the methods of other writers before he took to writing himself no one really understood better than he hesiods fine saying that the muses were born in order that they might be a forgetfulness of evils and a truce from cares no one understood better than he jouberts saying  fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality in literature the one aim is the beautiful once lose sight of that and you have the mere frightful reality and for the most part he succeeded in keeping down the morbid impulses of a spirit imprisoned and fretted in a crazy body save in such great mistakes as dr jekyll and mr hyde and a few other stories stevenson acted upon jouberts excellent maxim but scott and scott alone is always right in this matterright by instinct he alone is always a delight if all art is dedicated to joy as schiller declares and if there is no higher and more serious problem than how to make men happy then the waverley novels are among the most precious things in the literature of the world it is in literary criticism especially that though wise man refuses to prophesy unless he knows and no man knows anything about what the future will do with any writer or any book but in the long run the work of every artist in imaginative literature from homer to dickens is remembered by his characters and by his characters alone and the secret of the characterdrawing of the great masters seems to be this while moulding the character from broad general elements from universal types of humanity they are able to delude the readers imagination into mistaking the picture for real portraiture and this they achieve by making the portrait seem to be drawn from particular and peculiar individual traits instead of from generalities and especially by hiding away all purposes  aesthetic ethic or political stevenson as a critic was fully conscious of this law of imaginative art one great virtue of the great masters stevenson appreciated to the full their winsome softness of touch in character drawing we are not fond of comparing literary with pictorial art but between the work of the novelist and the work of the portrait painter there does seem a true analogy as regards the hardness and softness of touch in the drawing of characters in landscape painting that hardness which the general public love is a fault but in portrait painting so important is it to avoid hardness that unless the picture seems to have been blown upon the canvas as in the best work of gainsborough rather than to have been laid upon it by the brush the painter has not achieved a perfect success in the imaginative literature of england the two great masters of this softness of touch in portraiture are addison and sterne three or four hardlydrawn lines in sir roger or the two shandys or corporal trim would have so completely ruined the portraits that they would never have come down to us close upon addison comes fielding and then scott in whose vast gallery almost every portrait is painted with a gainsborough softness scarcely one is limned with those hard lines which are too often apt to mar the glorious work of dickens after scott comes thackeray unless it be mrs gaskell we are not in this article dealing with or even alluding to contemporary writers or we might easily say what novelists follow mrs gaskell whether or not stevensons instinct was for hardness or softness of touch though  new arabian nights show that he did not at first achieve softness his imagination though not robust was fine and it was based on reason he was always able to give a good account of his incidents and ready to do so in a letter now before us he says speaking of the fight on board the covenant in  kidnapped david and alan had every advantage on their side position arms training a good conscience  a handful of merchant sailors not well led in the first attack not led at all in the second could only by an accident have taken the round house by attack  and since the defenders had fire and arms and food it is even doubtful if they could have been starved out the only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught i half believe they would not but with all his undoubted talents and with all his 6tudy of and insight into the artistic methods of the masters has stevenson created any characters so new and so true that they will take their places in the great portrait gallery of classic english fiction  certainly there are one or two that ought to live if room can be found for them among these we are not sure that we can place alan breck he is delightful but a delightful bit of sir walters imagination if the master of ballantrae does not survive it will bo parti because of hardness of touch except for the feeble impression that the character made upon the critics who must in some degree be taken to express the general feeling we should have prophesied a long life for catriona she is a perfectly delightful character delightfully rendered though discussion of stevensons poetry we must

inland voyage and the last tjming to a cloe with the new arabian nights that is to say the present issue comlrises the journeyman work of thle writer already master of his tools but still uncertain how bet to employ them and yet the last volume of these preliminary exercise w hich contains the short stories of 1s77 sowu unmitakably in what direction the writer will exhibit hls strength i do not understand why the title of the new arabian nights was extended to tlhe pavilion n the linksi7 a lodging for the night the sire de malktrolt dour and providence and the guitar it surely an lelong only to the suicide club  and the rajas diamond tlhe other tales have no link with these nor are thley in the same genre and the blunder is unfortunate as the greater stories are thus named of the less the modernisation of the caliph haroun alraschid was an adventurous idea brilliantly carried out it puslies one step further into capital farce tennysons identification of king arthur uith a certain english gentleman of stateliest port but the tories themselves a mixture of melodrama and burlesque have not the remotet air of realit and hardly bear a second reading moreover the suicide club  contains ne picture thlat of mr malthus of such a nightmare horriblenes that it would not have passed the censor in any community of utopia there must have been a strain of lbrutalitv tomehere in stevenons fine natuie which cropped out once and again even in the later books  the body snatcher publihed ave the mark as a christmas stoi was the ornl tale in which thlis strain predominated  but the character of old pew in  treasure island and mfr hvde the alter teo of lr jekyll are imaginations that ought not to have been imagined plato we mav le sure would have invited their creator to leave ills commonwealth at the earlict posoille moment however this strain in the nature if i maw put it so wa for the most part kept well in check by mor e gentle anld humane qualities there are strong cen  stark characters enough in other talesnorthmour for examjle in thle pavilion on the links and the fraudulent banker huddletone in the same story is as much as mr malthus a study in the psychology of fear but these characters are well within the limits of literary decency the pavilion on the links indeed has all the qualities which combine to make the true stevenson there is the landscape so well drawn and so completely in key with the beauty or horror of the situation  there is the single vivid incident etched in with acid sharp and unforgettablein this case the noise of the wet finger on the windowpane without and the voice that shouted traditore through the shutters there is the wholesomeness of the sentiment  in the aristotelian sense of thle word  and there is the perfection of thle phraning the romantic tale of the strange courtship that weent on in the two hours before dawn inside the  sire de imaltroits oor  is singularly beautiful and unlike anything elc in fiction and then there are those charming french  artits in  providence and the guitar studied it would seem from a brokerdown actor and his wife full of sentiment described in the  inland oyage who preaclh tlat christian lesson which stevenson was never tired of inculcating that the life of a man does not consit in the abundance of things which he possesses finally there is a lodging for the night with its two scenes in the inn parlour and the lord of brisetouts kotel i do not believe that villon was as stevenson has represented him a compound of wolf and pig with some unexplalned calacity for making lballades but with no capacity fior seeing anything in his chivalrous host for the night but a very dull old gentleman the philosophy of revolt against societv which stevenson has elsewhere expounded should have saved him from such a lapse of critical imagination but strike out the name of the poet and one can enjoy to the full the vividnes of the contrast between the two scene and the wintry paris landscape that unites them the mention of villon brings me to speak of the only part of stevenon early writing which seem to fail of its mark and that i the critical work collected into  familiar studic of men and books stevenson in his humble lpreface recognie his tendency to depreciate a curious fault in an exponent of the philosophy of looking always on the better side but stevenson was not built for a critic his imagination was always at work on the material that came before him for study what seemed a striking saying summoned up in his mind a vivid picture of the man who would say such a thing and this became for him the man s true portrait but if the saying was really but an obiter dictum not really characteristic or if by some chance it had been misinterpreted then the whole character was miread i do not believe as i have said in the character drawn of francois villon most scotsmen fail to see the likeness in the portrait of burns but with that controveraan englishman had better not intermeddle but any reader of pepys diary  can see that stevensons  little sensualist in a periwig  is far enough from the truth about that interesting person it may be worth while to indicate a few points in which the painter has misrepresented his sitter because when a great artist paints a portrait we are apt to take the lifelikeness for granted and also because stevenson believed he had done pepys something more than justice take for a very clear example of misrepresentation the passage about the relations of pepys with william pen the quakermeanwhile there was growing up next door to him that beautiful nature william pen it is odd that pepys condemned him for a fop odd though natural enough when you see pens portrait that pepys was jealous of him with his wife but the cream of the story is when pen publishes his  sandy founda tion shaken and pepys has it read aloud by his wife i find it he savs  so well writ as i think it is too good for him ever to have writ it and it is a serious sort of book and not fit for cverybody to read tht italics are stevensons nothing is more galling to the mnerely respectable than to be brought in cortact with religious ardour pepys had his own foundation sandy enough but dear to him from practical considerations and he would read the book with true uneasiness of spirit for conceive the blow if by some plague accident this pen wvere to convert him and so on for some dozen lines more but if the reader one in ten thousand were to turn to pepys to see what he really did say about pens bookl he would find that what he thought dangerous in it wovas not its enthusiasm but its heresy this is the passage  pelling bath got me wl pens book against the trinity i got my wife to read it to me etc the title of the book was  the sandy foundations shaken or those doctrines of one god subsisting in three distinct and separate persons etc refuted from the authority of scripture testimonies and right reason so that all stevensons very cynical commentary on the words not fit for everybody to read rests on a simple misunderstanding or take another point pepys buys a i roguish french book and notes in his diary that he bought it in plain binding meaning to burn it when read  that it may not stand in the list of books nor among them to disgrace them if it should be found stevenson paraphrases this  he is full of precautions to conceal the disgrace of the purchase but pepyvs is writing as a collector with a respect to the dignity of his library he is not even considering the question about the morality or immorality of reading  roguish  books so again stevensons idea that pepys was a sort of leaf insect who took his moral colour from his neighbours and was only virtuous when under the influence of sir william coventry is not supported by the diary coventry was no better than his contemporaries in regard to the seenth commandment and in regard to the eighth we find him more than once making a sort of apologia to pepys or once more what ground is there for stevensons wild idea that pepys intended his diar to be one day made public  i the greatness of his life he says  was open yet he longed to communicate its smallness also and while contemporaries bowed before him he must buttonhole posterity with the news that his periwig was once alive with nits i confess lively writing of this sort whet it belittles the characters of the dead without a spark of evidence makes me angry stevenson quotes the solemn sentence with which the diary closes but if he had raised his eves to the sentence next before it he would have found that it disposed of his theory  and thus ends all that i doubt i shall ever be able to do with my own eves in the keeping of my journal i being not able to do it any longer having done now so long as to undo my eves almost every time that i take a pen in my hand and therefore whatever comes of it i must forbear and therefore resolve from this time forward to have it kept by my people in longhand ard must be contented to set down no more than is fit for then e9nd all the world to know or if there be anything i must ndeavour to keep a margin in my book open to add here end there a note in shorthand with my own hand young entlemen with a genius for style should be warned oxf riticism the valuable part of stevensons writing outside his stories  that in which he writes about himself about himself aid his travels and his meditations on men and things we could niever have too much because he looked at the world with tresh eyes i have a fancy for testing a mans powers of natural description by his handling of a snowstorm iand i remember the joy it gave me years ago to come upon this passage of our author the snow fell with rigorous relentless persistence sometimes the wind made a sllv and scattered it in flying vortices smetimes there was a lull and flake after flake descended out f the black nigh air silent circuitous interminable tfhe air was raw and pointed but not far below freezing and the flakes were large damp and adhesive the whole city was sheeted up an armnv might have marched from end to end and not a footfall giv fii the alarm if there were any belated birds in heaven they br w the island like a laree white datch and the bridges like slim white spars on the black ground of the river but in the travel books natural description is kept in due subordination to the proper study of mankind and there as in the moral essays wie find stevenson acclaiming with joy mans imperfect virtues and calling upon every body to take up the great task of being happy themselves anti making others happp quotation would be an endless luxury but one passage may be allowed which we may well believe seemed to its author the conclusion of the whole matter certainly for himselfall who have meant good vork with their wvhole hearts have done good work although they may die before they have the time to sign it every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a houpeful impulse behind it in the world and bettered the tradition of mankind and even if death catch people like an open pitfall and in mid

knife the other by the seine and the only morsel of contemporary history introduced to flavour the composition is the assassination of the due de berri all this is the fault of inexperience and shows a too eager desire to secure entertainment to the reader as we have said there are many better things in the book  and lord belfast gives evidence of nice observation clever writing and very often extremely just feeling which we may expect on another occasion to be turned to better use he has a quick eye for the social absurdities of display and pretence in the furnishing of brains as well as rooms and is not sparing of their exposure mr fulloms daughter of night shares to some extent in the objection we have made to the two generations though varied with scenes of a quiet cliaracter it opens with a succession of incidents made up of the most strange and strong improbabilities and passes through incredible extremes to a blissful endwith a final touch of murder suicide and transportation to clear off remaining obstacles to happiness very often however mr fullom s changes and transitions are very clever as where he turns his fireeating methodist firebrass dobbs into an inveterate professor of the creed of pio nono we must regret that what seems to have originated the book was not carried more steadily through it the opening scenes give a sort of picture of the

B7770,"['6252952', '8781889']",  the boddington peerage who won and who wore lt a story of the best and worst society by george augustus sala skeetaccording to the current novelistic doctrine every member of the english aristocracy makes it a rule to commit bigamy mr sala who can do and ought to know better has presented us with another story turning upon the contingency that the heir to title and estates was suddenly stripped of his fair inheritance by the discovery that one or other of his parents was at the time of their marriage still entangled in preexisting matrimonial engagements in the present case if we have succeeded in threading rightly a somewhat complicated story the legal perplexities are rendered exceptionally intricate and the simple bigamy that satisfies the requirements of his brother novelwriters is elevated by mr sala into something like poly gamy the result is that the beddington peerage is won by turn and worn for a time by claimants of each of whom it is successively proved that although he may be his fathers own child he cannot claim in legal phrase  to be heirmale of his body lawfully begotten the changes of fortune and developments of character thus arising can be easily imagined the author has indeed skilfully made the most of his opportunities commencing with bigamy he represents all the characters drawn from aristocratic circles from the duchess downwards as fools libertines spendthrifts insolvents or worse they never think of paying a debt or keeping a promise except upon compulsion their lives are passed in a round of intrigues and their thoughts monopolised by contrivances to advance their personal or family interests by any expenditure of false witnessing and at any sacrifice of the fair fame or just rights of their neighbours finally if any one comes in their way with an inconvenient claim or a dangerous secret they show a very scientific acquaintance with the mysteries of strychnine we cannot of course presume to controvert this description of an elevated class of society with whom mr sala evidently enjoys an intimate acquaintance to which any information we have been enabled to gather from a diligent study of  court circulars  and  fashionable intelligence  is comparatively speaking mere heathen ignorance his portraiture of the upper classes is no doubt an authentic photograph all that we can venture to complain of is that the story on the whole is extravagant and impossible discarding nature and probability the author has depicted an artificial condition of society which never really existed and we hope never will exist his counterfeit presentment of the superior classes is about as true as mr brights ideal of an unreformed house of commons or inspector fields notion of commercial morality  the haddington peerage who won it and who wore it a story of the best and worst society by george augustus sala 3 vols skeetin the curious halfcynical halfmelancholy preface to this novel mr sala as policemen say makes a statement of how it came to be written and its claims to be considered more as a fresh story than a reprint seeing it bears little or no resemblance to the chapters which appeared under the same name in a weekly journal as a fresh work sent forth by the author and written advisedly we deal with it everything that mr sala writes is characterised by a robust graphic power and a faculty for description differing from most peoples power of description in that the objects are presented in the very essence that makes them what they are there is no mere surfacepainting mr sala goes at once to the idea which makes and animates the facts as a novel however the babbington peerage is more like a monster frankenstein than any work of art or nature the story whioh begins in a very striking manner loses itself through digressions and tortuous windings innumerable and is never indeed fairly told out but then the digressions and observations are all so good in their way and the incidental sketches of life and character are so clever that no reader can wish them away although a mild desire to get along with the tale or rather to get fairly hold of it may from time to time make itself felt in the bosom of an impatient reader the story of  the baddington peerage is like nothing out of one of eugene sues novelsbuch  noble captains countesses lords and scoundrels were never  formed to meet by nature the author himself seems to forget his original intentions one of the charactersthat of the lost heiris left a mere shadowy figure scarcely even rubbed into the canvas his career and catastrophe are alike huddled up and left in a most unsatisfactory state a few strong marks scored in at the end are not sufficient to redeem the want of systematic and careful workmanship or the vacillating intention with which all that concerns frank leslie is drawn aa to the countess she is port stmartin every inch of her bigamies and secret marriages seem the order of things in mr salaa  world displayed tinctop the villain and main staple of the piece changes his character and nature altogether in the last volutaehe never was very like life but he grows altogether wonderful as he goes on polyblanks the grotesque falstaff of villany is well sustained and well conceived he is a sooundrel an evil man whose every day and every act is evil  a debauched drunken unscrupulous utterly wicked man he is redeemed from the readers hatred by an obatreperoua joviality a wit and humour which if it does not heal the wounds inflicted on the readers moral sensibility at least keeps them from feeling painful polyblanka is utterly and entirely bad but he is so overflowing with life and strength both of will and deed that there is no despising him not even of heartily detesting him one has hated many good people worse in ones time the best and most powerful scene in the book is without doubt that where the poor drunken outcast breaks in on the marriage festivities with intent to howl forth her secret and breaks down in drunken incoherence the sudden change which imminent danger of discovery works on gervase falcon the man of respectabilitythe sweeping away of all the decorous fences and social landmarks of his life leaving nothing except the wild beast at bay overtaken by the fate which he had so long baffled is very true and very powerful the grotesque sketches of the pomps and vanities of the world seen with disenchanted and irreverent eyes are droll enough though occasionally the drollery degenerates into cynicism with all its faults of omission and commission the baddington peerage shows what mr sala could do an if he would with all his talent and unquestionable power myxsala lacks what jockeys call stay he does not hold out under the necessity of a continuous effort but is fitful broken and wayward  the baddington peerage adda one more to the heap of things incomplete and purposes betrayed which are the saddest of all the wrecks which lie so thick upon the shores of life and time,dom_contra

boots and trousers on his head was a lowcrowned furcap made of otterskin from the back of xvhjch was suspended a black tail four or five inches in length his neck was enveloped xvith several folds of a yarn comforter similar in colour and appearance to his sash a long e i iron spur strapt on his left heel completed his equip ment his countenance at least all that oould be seen of it for he wore an enormous pair of untrimmed whiskers which united under his chin nnd protruded over his neckcloth and wrappings exhibited a singular mixture of firmness quickness of temper and good nature  while his bright restless eye peculiar forehead and expressive mouth denoted both cunning and humour  ah said barclay as soon as he got a glimpse of him  here is master zeb hunt he ia what our friend stephen

heard all over the house   mr hunt lifted his cap to barclay as he entered the room a mode of salutation not very common in nova scotia a short free and easy nod of the head being infinitely less troublesome nnd ceremonious and therefore in more general use morning to yousquire he said in his accustomed loud tone and familiar manner i am glad to see you i have been waiting for you for sum time

finger on the pianny and so gentle a child can manage him when you want hija to go take up the reins and hes off like a fox when you want him to stop throw them down and hell stand all day the way he makes the spokes fly round in a wheel so that you can only see the rim as if it was a hoop is amazing it frightened nie at first and i aint easy scared by a horse he is a kperior animal beyond all doubt i never was suited before in all my life nnd i dont know as he aint spoilt me so i shall be suited agin sometimes i cant part with him any how for i cant never get another like him  and sometimes i take a notion into my head i ought to sell him as it is too much money for a poor man like me to have in a horse youve heard tell of heber of windsor havent you  well hes crazy after him and if he dont know a good one when he sees him he does when he tries him and thats mre than most men do id like you to have him for you are a judge of a horseperhaps the best in these parts though ive seen the leak put into you too afore now youiwill take good care of him and i wouldnt like to see the critter knocked about like a corn he will lead your tandem beautiful and keep his traces up without doing the whole work and filling himself a thread will guide him and then he knows how to slack up a goingdown hill so as not to drag the wheeler off his legs oh hes ii doll his sinews are all scorpion tails and whipcords nnd hes muscle enough for two beasts of his size you cant fault him in no particular for he is perfect head or neck shoulder or girth back or loins stifle or hock or chest and bastions and as for hoofs they actilly seem as if they was made a purpose for a trotter in fact you may say hes the greatest piece of slut ever wrapped up in a horsehide come and look at him and judge for yourself my price is two fifty  but if you like him say the word and he is yours at two hundred dollars for id like you to have him i consait hell suit you to a notch and do me credit too

tumbler of rum and water squire you have heard zeb hunt talk afore today i reckon i have been listening to him while he has been arunuing on like a millwheel apraising of his horse up to the very nine as the pink of all perfection but he never said a word about his soundness do you mark  if you intend to make a trade with him i guess you had better be wide awake for he is too much formost folks a man must rise early in the morning to catch him nappingwhats that you say you leatherlipped rascal retorted the pippin as he advanced menac ingly towards his accuser  how dare you put in your oar when gentlemen are bantering for a trade you ewenecked cathammed shadbuilt lopeared onderbread villain you measure other folks corn with your own bushel and judge your neighbours by yourselfabout as bad a standard as youll find any where squire he continued turning away with apparent contempt from the man xvho had traduced him if there is any one thing i pride myself upon in the world it is on being

B4809,['3215266'],  hovel 1motes a market bundle by a xeil lyons 7s thornton lbutterworth the humour of mr neil lyons is a ripe and rare vintage it cannot be described by comparison because it is peculiarly his own the humour is less in his incidents than in his manner of presenting them it is chiefly the humour of character and of his own whimsical outlook upon the motley world of men and women or upon that side of it in which he has staked his claim high life is not his province but he knows common and ordinary people respectable and unrespectable with an amazing intimacy and like old izaac with his worms handles them as if he loved them he does not trouble to invent a plot for everything he touches turns to a story in his hands and he is as much at home among village folk rural carpenters gardeners pedlars and the drifting flotsam of the countryside as among the miscellaneous cockneys that inhabit the mean streets of london here for the most part he pictures the humours and occasionally the pathos of country life and character with intermittent excursions to town and gives glimpses of little episodes that arose in both places out of the late war as in the delightful sketches of  the german from perhaps  representing the platoon and  private jupps mission everything in all the stories depends on the humour and the art with which they are told the humour is as shrewd as it is quaint and kindly and is touched elusively at times with a sense of tears the art is exquisitely simple and effective and both are inseparable from the personality of the author it is not often one lights upon a book of short stories so intensely human and amusing and so fine in workmanship as are those in  a market bundle,dom_contra
B4353,"['8530691', '6648950']",  jupiters daughtees jupiters davgnters by mrs jenkin in one volume smith and elder the subject of this little story is french love and marriage and its moral is simply this that young ladies ought to be allowed to choose their own husbands without restriction or advice from their parents the story trenches on dangerous ground and the moral is a questionable one mrs jenkin has studied french nature very closely but had she gone more deeply into the causes of those difficulties and hardships of social life which she has observed she would probably have discovered that the tight and tyrannous constraint which french mothers exercise over their daughters before marriage and the perilous freedom in which these same daughters indulge after marriage are but the natural outcome of the whole condition of society in france and especially of its women the bargaining of french parents is we cannot doubt the result of a parental instinct to make the best of a bad state of things for their children it is only in slave countries that the dealer bargains with the master quite irrespectively of the good of the slave but where the dealer is the slaves own parent one object in the bargain will always be that the thing sold shall have its share of the profits the principle upon which a french parent acts appears to be this  i will use my experience of life for the purpose of selecting a husband for my child when that is done it will depend on herself to mould her fate out of the given ingredients it is too often the case that a french girl is utterly unable to mould out of the ingredients supplied to her anything like a happy or useful life and drifts hopelessly away to the quicksands or founders on a rock before her weddingdress is oldfashioned but the majority do scramble on somehow to the end and have the good fortune to be overlooked by moralists and romance writers here and there however some poor wretch gifted above her fellows with an unfair share of nervefibre will make herself miserable and spoil her beauty by struggling against conditions which she cannot rectify the nobler the nature the more animated the struggle society meantime stands by ready to pounce on this its choice prey and whether she eludes its fatal grip or no such a woman makes an excellent subject for the heroine of a novel puuline reudu is an only child and will inherit a fortune her parents are rentiersthat is living on their dividendsand quite retired from business her home is a small french country town called st gloi here amid a little group of thoroughly french people the young girl grows up utterly unlike the rest of the world around her endowed with a rich pure nature innocent as a flower and capable of loving warmly and of suffering acutely the old gentleman at the neighbouring chateau dies and his young successor arrives from abroad bringing with him a parisian friend named m vilpont of course it is the heir with whom pauline ought to fall in love  and of course it his friend the enigmatical parisian nephew of a marquis and litterateur who wins her affections but paulines mother a soundhearted wife but a very mercenary woman does not believe in vilpont and will have nothing to say to him nobody in st gloi believes in him except one charming old french woman paulines godmother this lady lives in bourgeois independence in her country house surrounded by vineclad hills she manages her own estates gathers in her vintage and is a thorough woman of business in her we see the bright side of french social life she is truly a happy woman with influence to do good and a quick sense of how it may be done but in this case her friendship is of no avail vilpont is rejected not by the daughter who loves him but by her mother and that mothers acquiescent consort in course of time the doomed girl is bestowed upon a rich algerian merchant and the scene is transferred to paris here pauline and her first lover meet again in new circumstances and the sorrows of her life begin to take a definite shape we will not spoil a good story by telling its main points from the face of la belle france  the veil is lifted for a brief space and we see only pale haggard passionworn sorrow that this is the real thing and no phantom may be judged from the peculiarly calm and honest style of the narration it is a vivid and admirably drawn picture of modern french life compressed into a small canvas the background of this picture is all france but is so deftly introduced with a glimpse of the brilliant capital before and during the terrible siege of 1870 and of rural france of which english people know about as much as they do of siberia that while the details are rich and varied they never appear overpacked nor does the background as a whole intrude itself irritatingly on our notice the human predominates over the physical and the chief interest centres from first to last upon the two principal characters both these are perfectly natural and vilpont never even in his best moments rises above the standard which the authoress had originally designed for him he is a frenchman of fashion to the last chapter with occasional gleams in him of something better our first impression on taking up a story about foreigners written by an englishwoman is one of suspicion  why cannot she write about her own people  it is not possible but that she shall fall into some palpable error if she writes outside her own immediate experience is what we all feel inclined to assert there can be little doubt that any writer of romance placing his plots in a foreign land or in a bygone time does to a great extent sacrifice his power of accuracy and consequent chance of producing a work of lasting value it is very tempting an imaginative writer becomes enamoured of a period or a people a scott wanders back into the age of chivalry a thackeray will suddenly assume the mannerism and the very mood of the eighteenth century and george eliot not satisfied with english nature and english wit with which she charmed the world and which she understood as a child understands its native tongue strains and exercises her genius among quaint old italian scenes in all these cases the materials are not in stock but are got up dexterously it may be but 8till got up mechanically for the occasion to say the least of it it is a dangerous experiment and the time has scarcely arrived when the most enthusiastic critic can venture to pronounce a verdict on its ultimate success in any case considered as elements for historical research in the future these books will be useless such other novels on the contrary as fieldings smolletts scotts novels of scottish life and character thackerays modern novels and geuigc eliots oarlier works will have the same kind of value in the far future for tne kiotorian as he finds now in the old plays in pepys diary or in chaucers itua for in all of these he will see contemporary english life painted vividly as the writers saw it all about themselves he will obtain from them a kind of knowledge most useful to him and to the world and utterly inaccessible otherwise and this is one practical good in novels which the novelist will do well not altogether to overlook mrs jenkins charming story errs less than the others to which we have alluded in its choice of subject the authoress has not selected a foreign people to write about for any whim of novelty or enthusiasm but evidently because this is a subject she thoroughly understands and loves in fact we should be inclined to say she understands french manners and men better than she does those of our own island but within the atmosphere of french sentiment and folly there is never wanting a current of wholesome and sincere morality which is thoroughly and unmistakably english no french novelist could describe the gentle old cure sitting among the pretty girls whom he has christened and confirmed and hopes some day to marry happily as mrs jenkin has done it is always her good and honest folk that really charm us and we turn from the others as truly and boldly described with a sense of weariness if not of dislike there is no character in  jupiters daughters equal for subtlety and interest to that of the exiled italian teacher in mrs jenkins former novel of who breaks pays  but considered as a whole this latest is a great advance upon her earlier productions and deserves to be judged by a higher standard than ninetenths of the novels of the day the quality which distinguishes mrs jenkin most highly as a writer of fiction is a certain sympathetic glow a warmbloodedness which comes like a sudden suffusion into a pale cheekrarely perhaps but always at a supreme moment e r m  jupiters daughters by mrs charles jenkins smith  elder 1874 brokeni boudls by hawley smart hurst  blackett 1874 twivst cup and lip by mary lovett cameron s tinsley 1874 thorpe regis by the author of the rose garden smith  elder 1874 good titles are scarce but the author of jupeiters daughters might easily have found a more appropriate one for a tale so charming or rather for a tale with so charming a heroine the scene is laid in st gloi a provincial french town as dull as st oggs or the cities where emma bovary was so unhappy and balzacs vieille file so unfor tunate but none of the characters in jnupiters daughters break the stillness and the decalogue in so passionate a way as the women of balzac and flaubert yet the materials for an explosion are not wanting there is a girl pauline rendu who is  unlike other girls and has to try  not to be for ever indignant in a home where con versation resembles nothing so much is a page from the matrilrbmonial neacs the interest of the story centres in her relations with vilpont a playwright of good family like gerfant in charles do bernards novel of that name vilpont is not uninteresting but he is too much of an english ladys idea of a french poet too much george war rington under other skies it is a pretty incident where vilponts eyes are described as filling with tears when for once he goes to church with pauline and her family and the girl notices and  in a second she had deified this man of the world and the adventure in the storm is well told though here as indeed throughout the  business if we may use the term is too obvious still a storm is better than a bull if heroines must be in danger and heroes must be intrepid after paulines marriage the story gets into regions which they order better in france the authors moralisings on english and french views of matrimony and of the education of girls come to little more than the trite doctrine that if one is to be unhappy it is pleasantest to 1e allowed to choose ones own way of misery the war comes in almost too opportunely a good incident that of z6lies attempt at murder is spoiled by careless handling and the reader concludes with the feeling that pauline is a  star  who outshines a secondrate company and rather old properties for the reason why the tale is called jupifers daug7ters the inquirer must be referred to a wellknown passage in the ninth book of the iliad broken bouds is a lively enough novel in mr whyte melvilles lighter manner there is less moralising less reference to the authors salad days and to the classical dictionary but there is also less adventure mr whyte melville too would have made his heroines really piquantes but the ladies described by mr hawley smart are with the best intentions only aqgaates we like the dark one best the fair girl never quite recovers the readers esteem after her  love passage  with the first villain mr rolf laroom mr laroom was miss rose field ings guardians partner when miss field ing insisted on flirting with him and ulti mately on feeding him with strawberries7 he kissed her thereon ensued what might better be called a spirited rally or a lively setto than a  lovepassage the delicate girl  smote him with clenched fist in the face with great force  thus as we afterwards learn drawing first blood but severely damaging her knuckles  one of her many rings was broken and two of her delicate fingers severely cut now later in the story m1r dainty ellerton a person of much refinement says in speaking of his mother that the dear old mium can take a facer mr laroom could not take a facer lie brooded over his defeat in a spirit unwortlhy of the english sportsman hle determined to marry miss fielding and tamue her proud spirit and incidentally to ruin her family he only succeeded ill getting another of her admirers imprisoned in portland and the rest of the tale is taken up with the account of the ellfrts made to get hini out it is liffieult to inake au escape from prison uninteresting but smr hawley smnart even with the aid of a clhart fails to excite his readers like dumas or m1r charles read the novel ends  badly as most novel readers wvill think for the dark heroine is drowned and the pugilistic heroine marries dainty ellerton whose couragc and strength indeed the author cannot too highly extol the comic clharacters are dreary but the book on the whole is readable somehow and after all that is the main point readableness is like charm or distinction or amiability it defies analysis and marks off m1r hawley smarts least successful work from such poor stuff as the next book on our list 7cva cup to lip is the story of a most uninteresting maiden the best we can say for fancy darrel is that she liked chippendales chairs the worst that she admired auerbachs auf der h6ke she married lancelot darrel though she did not care for him he left her on her wedding day not alleging  private business in kaiisclhatka like the hero of the iore  lut the death of his sister and the illness of his father when he did not come back fancy did not care and amused herself with harry daventry on her husbands sudden return from australia she said  how lucky i did not go into the drawingroom  so awkward with harry there too it was awkward as she was married to mis darrel and engaged to harry that gentleman had time good taste to die just when the relations of all parties were getting strained and fancy returned to her premier aoaniu they in spected harrys grave as is in these cases made and provided and after her stormy youth fancy  landed at a quiet haven wherein to rest the fiery trials otf the past were never forgotten and it was fancys delight to think that they would all one day be united within the golden gates if they had all been as easygoing as fancy one cannot help thinking that they might have lived fairly comfortably on this side the golden gates wherever they may be thtoije regig is another proof if one were wanted of the rarity of that genius which scott admired so much in miss austen aud which delights us now in the works of miss thackeray  the exquisite touch as scott calls it  which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interest ing the wonderful talent for describing the involvements and feelings of ordinary life is what the author of thorpe regis just fails to reach it is no great reproach not to attain to the highest merit and it is a pity to have to point out the failure in work that is all so careful so honest and refined yet it must be said that while involvements abound in this novel while characters of the most carefully commonplace sort are liberally introduced while scenery is described with exquisite feeling and charm there is yet an absence of power and of firmness and thus the tale fails to captivate and absorb the reader who is but moderately excited even by the perplexities of winifred who is as much the best figure here as pauline is in the first novel o our list perhaps we feel too sure that the author will not leave her always unfortunate too certain that the mystery of the undelivered letter will be explained and the honest though most irritating hero re stored to the good opinion of his neighbours as a fair specimen of the sentiment of tklrpo 7eqys we may quote the description of winifreds melancholy walk through the fieldsthe day was delicately bright and hot across a pal moon that looked herself no more than a statillnary cloud little wilful vapours which had broken away from larger masses were sailing red cattle satisfied with their rich flowery pastitre had gathered under the hedges to chew the cud and sleepily whisk away the flies there were cool flashing lights and tender depths ot colour and a sweet content over everything and poor winifred growing sadder and eadder with the sense of contrast yet walking more slowly and looking wistfully at the long grass with a vague longingr to lie down in it and let everything go by and away for ever if she has not quite succeeded the author of thoreae regis has at least been constant in her aim and unsparing in her carefulness to be more than this is  the gift of for tune a lang

B4665,['6727320'],  literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by

conscientious goodnatured honest dullard howard tracy the supercilious patrician of the school henderson the wit of st winifreds jones and mack worth two distinct types of the publicschool bully are welldrawn characters though not altogether original conceptions the events of school life like college experiences are so closely reproduced year after year and generation after generation that novelty of incident cannot fairly be demanded of writers who illustrate the world of school but still the author of  st winifreds might have walked in less familiar tracks in the outofbounds portions of his tale for instance the appenfel excursion and its immediate consequences were clearly suggested by reminiscences of tom browns schooldays apart hoavever from an alloy of imitation and other important defects the sterling goodness of  st winifreds is so great that we close its pages with approval and predict for them many readers  st winifreds or thc world of school edinburgh a and c black this is a story of school life too earnest and in part too powerful to find its readers only among the young the writer has put all his energy into his work and has not the faintest idea of writing down to an imaginary level he writes his best and means with his whole heart all that he says there are touches of weakness mingled with its strength and the tale is too long failing somewhat

languishes remains alive though reader who has arrived near the middle of the book with an impression that it is almost or altogether the best story of school life he has ever read finds himself though with lessening satisfaction fairly carried to the end whether he wiu or no if all that follows the most touching chapters on the death and burial of daubeny were compressed into at least half its present compass reconstructed and in part rewritten we might have here a better book than  tom browns school days or we could spare that whole elaboration of the fall of kenrick into evil and his ultimate recovery and the story would gain very much by being altogether snapped off in the middle if a couple of new chapters were furnished to round off the broken end of the part that is most worth retaining the purpose of the tale is to protest manfully against every theory of public school life which holds that a boy cannot be conscientious to the utmost true and just to the minutest word and act merciful prayerful modestly watchful for all good that his right hand may find to do without cant without being regarded as a milksop by his schoolfellows or being the less able to lead a side at football leap with the best laugh with the merriest and brave perils from which they would flinch who do not interpret their duty by the highest test of all and who have not a living faith to steady them walter evson the hero of the story of st winifreds is of course the writers model boy he comes to the great public school by the seashore from wholesome vigorous home training bold and strong to do right and to battle for it when need is with his schoolboys fists it happens that he is placed under a master who is rigidly just by routine and being unaccustomed to the school work of learning forms of words by memory instead of getting the facts represented by them into his head by understanding all his efforts tend only to the heaping of punishment upon punishment thus he starts in the school with a bad character is driven to desperate resentment and defiance and at last breaking open the desk of the master he has learned to defy he tosses the punishmentbook to be burnt and also crams into the fire a roll of ms which proves to be the all but completed opus magnum that has been the darling labour of the masters life when the truth is known walter is humbled to the dust but the master whom he has wronged so deeply conquers himself bears his cross half conscious of his own past error saves the boy from expulsion and by his own selfconquest secures walters heart but walter evson is now worse than characterless he is shunned and despised by all the school but he suffers and works patiently wins friendships among some of the better class and commands at last respect from nearly all his schoolfellows when at last he and two of his friends were caught in mists on the top of the great mountain behind st winifreds dangerous with risk of precipice and open deserted mines and walter evson by three times traversing the terrible razorback rescues himself and his friends he becomes of course a hero to his schoolfellows his friend daubeny a quiet amiable boy of slow wit and strict sense of duty who has been killing himself with overwork had failed in strength on the ascent and gone back he returned to pass into the sick room and there die of the two boys kenrick and power who faced death upon the mountain kenrick is represented as having a good character not based upon religion he has a poor home in the swamps of fuzby le mud where his mother is the widow of a good curate killed by the cruel aspersions of his ignorant parishioners kenrick has invited walter to visit him in the poor home of which he is ashamed and when he pays the visit the meanest boy in the school being in the same railway train happens to see the poor cart in which walter is driven off that boy hears also living not far away the old scandal against kenricks father when all return to school kenricks poverty and thc accusation against bis dead father is on many tongues and kenrick believes that only walter can have betrayed him so begins with misconstruction and the parting of friends kenricks decline into bad company among his schoolfellows his antagonism to walter and his lapse into what the writer of the story broadly calls sin the account of this and of the events that lead to his recovery and make a christian of him being as we have said the central thread of the narrative of school incidents throughout rather more than the second half of the volume although this leads to a vivid sketch of peril by sea and storm it contains nothing so good as the accounts of walters rebellion and the schoolmasters selfconquest of the peril on ri tfie mountain and of the last days of daubeny the style i throughout the book is good and thc descriptions of j scenery are well done while the numerous subordinate  i incidents and characters through which the writer spread ing a

there to raise a suspicion that the remainder of the novel is to be a political treatise consisting mainly of an exposition of the principles of moderate conservatism in which his hero found a career even if we had not had little sympathy with the creed expounded we imagine we should have looked upon this plunge into politics in a novel of which the main interest is not political as an unprofitable deviation but the dull interval does not last long after some chapters of commonplace when the reader feels inclined to throw down the book as containing no incident that he could not

whether we overcome them or they overcome us says the young queen to the bard amid the havoc of war and slaughter the far vision was nearer than the horrors encompassing her body she is of the kin of this people this sparse and scattered people  who have come but seldom into the world and always for its trouble and to bind the hearts of men with a leash of mystery the dreamers who must do what they dream the doers who must dream what they do men of verse says the wise king who had discovered his lonely greatness why did you make me sin against the secrecy of wisdom for law was made by man for the welfare of man but wisdom the gods have made and no man shall live by its light for it and the hail and the rain and the thunder follow a way that is deadly to mortal things then he set out to find his kindred it would be easy to classify the stories in accordance with their artistic merits which are so various that one might reach with grumbling to a thirdbest section buf save to mention that the moods are almost as varied as in  the celtic twilight a comparison between the stories or between them and their predecessors is not the most profitable work of a reviewer mr yeatss abundant humour  the secret rose by w b yeats with illustrations by j b yeats lawrence and bullen is not wanting in the tales of hanrahan the red and we find it softened to a gentle irony in  out of the rose which might be a page out of  don quixote and in  the heart of the spring that is no unexpected quality though his reputation rests rather on his visionary suggestions one has noted before too but the power of it is growing in him the frequent association of spiritual truth with familiar circumstance this is the sign of the effective poet of the poet with vigour in his imaginings the great secret was whispered to the old magician in  the heart of the spring by one who wore a red cap and whose lips were white with the froth of the new milk to me the best are the six that tell the story of hanrahan the red hanrahan is a very distinct and special human being a hedge schoolmaster and a poet and a neerdowell too much himself to be just like any other hedgeschoolmaster poet or neer dowell but i doubt if ever the poets history has been set forth with such proud truth before without fear of the world for his shortcomings without seeking its favour for this  ruler of the dreams of men hanrahan is very vain and he loves notoriety he is of evil repute yet an excellent fellow withal in his convenient moods he is drunken very often with the brew of the little pot and sometimes with dreams he sells the book of wisdom for a pig the pig for whisky and after being disgracefully intoxicated has a night of splendid ecstasy the powers  passed through his dreams crowned with rubies and having roses in their hands and in the morning he awoke a roughclad peasant shivering on the earthen floor this episode is followed by his making unscrupulous loveand being ignominiously defeated by her careful eldersto a young girl he is the king of lovers if constancy be not asked for in truth cluna of the wvave an immortal sought him but she was repulsed for the earthly temper was on him then a vagabond with a  devil in the soles of his feet a humorous rascal who teaches english out of  the lives of celebrated rogues and rapperees he uses his schoolchildren as mediums by which to widen the sound and the fame of his terrible satires yet is he beloved of women young and old and much dependent in his tamer moods on human shelter and sympathy no one can curse more bitterly his enemies yet while lamenting his own insults as in the songs he made out of the grotesque story of the twisting of the rope his mind reaches beyond himself as he made them his dreams deepened and changed until he was singing about the twisting of the rope of human sorrows his last days were black misery pierced by visions of eternal beauty but by degrees the body made fewer demands on him and  it was as though he became incorporate with some more poignant and fragile world whose marchlands are the intense colours and silences of this world he died a sordid outcast ministered to by a mad vagrant when his body was found it was given a great burying and so let us all be grateful for the limitation of our gifts that keeps us in safe paths and likewise may all poets find some time an interpreter of such brave sympathy as this initiate of  the secret rose the tales are clear and simple on the outside as if for childrens eyes wise and beautiful on the inner side with a dangerous wisdom and beauty for their sweet and bitter secrets do not feed this worlds strength but they will only call fatally to a few the rest of us if we linger and wonder as at an entertainment will then go our cheerful prudent ways with apologies to the world for an hour of idle alien dreaming a m  the seceet eose the secret rose by w b yeats with illustrations by s b yeats lawrence  bullen ix is a hard case when the one right word for a critic to use is a word that has been so hackneyed so bandied about in vague characterisation that it has become rightly suspect and almost even tabooed yet hackneyed or not there is only one word which describes the quality of mr yeatss stories and that is glamourthe glamour of the celt his tales have a good deal of talk about magic in them more in fact than is to everybodys taste for not everybody can be brought to take spiritraising seriously but on every page in the book there is proof given of a magic to which all lovers of literature must be submissivethe natural magic of style here is no artifice of haziness no mist of words rather the extraordinary thing about these stories is the distinctness with which they bring present to the senses whatever is related take for instance a few words from the first one the binding of the hair which tells of queon dectira and the bard aodhs hughs last song upon whose prelude there broke in the alarm for battle  then he took down from a pillar his shield of wicker and hide and his bronze helmet and sword and passed among the crowd that went shouting through the wide door and there was no one left in the room except the queen and her women and the foolish king who slept on with his head against a pillar how that conjures up the sense of desolation and vastness in the hall that a moment before had been crowded  one seems to feel the noise of feet dying away it is all distinct but with the distinctness of a dream and mr yeatss utterance is like aodhs  dreamheavy the thing is done partly by a singular felicity of comparison as in this phrase a very old man whose face was almost as fleshless as the foot of a bird but chiefly by the distinctness of the artists own vision yet this constant appeal to the eye is never allowed to predominate or to mask the central thought which each study conveys as for instance  the heart of the spring which sets out the aspiration of the alchemist and lifes ironic commentary upon it dreamy as the stories are they are not fantastic their characters act with human coherency mr yeats is fond of the supernatural in the curse of the fires and of the shadows  he has introduced it for his own pleasure since in the tradition it was no one of the she who led the five cromwellians to their fatal gallop over the precipice but a simple peasant yet we like him best when he does not stir outside of the human pale the crucifixion of the outcast is a grim tale of the way in which respectable folk dealt with the strolling gleeman when respectability had full power to make itself respected  we suspect an apologue anyhow this is one of the only two stories in the book touched with the humour that made celtic twilight so delightful the other is by far the best of them all the tale or series of tales relating to the adventures of owen hanrahan the bed last of the gaelic singers in ireland here is a splendid touch the fjoet whose dower over women had been not ess than his passion for them sees a girl crying and offers help   my father and my mother and my brothers she went on  are marrying me to old paddy doe because of the hundred acres he rents under the mountain and i would have you put him into a rhyme as you put old peter kumartin in the days when you were young that sorrow may be over him rising up and lying down   i will put him into a uttle song that shall bring shame and sorrow over him but how many years has he for i would put them into a song   oh he has years upon yearshe is as old as you are owen hanrahan    as old as me said hanrahan in a broken voice there are twenty years between him and me if there is a day an evil hour has come for owen hanrahan when a colleen with a cheek hke the blossom of may thinks him an old man colleen colleen an arrow is in my heart beautiful as is the vision of owen hanrahan with its fine symbolism there is nothing in it worth that but beautiful it is a new and genuine inspiration from the old mythology of the gael the old gods are no more dead for mr yeats than were pan and apollo for milton  when one looks into the darkness he says in his preface there is always something there most of us look very little into the dark and we are inclined to retort that those who look into the dark see nothing but fancies yet such a book as this makes one ponder whether the light of common day does not blind us to many starry presences for all that we have no patience with the last and longest story  eosa alchemica which is totally distinct from the rest and resembles the recital of an opiumdream like everything else in the book however it is beautifully writtenin long slow undulating sentences easy and sinuous in their progress as the motion of a serpent the illustrations are admirable there are not many points of likeness between mr yeats and mr kipling but each has a father who draws beautiful pictures for his sons books print and paper leave nothing to be desired but it was a pity to use ridged not smooth material for the binding as it impairs the effect of miss gyles s intricate symbolic design for the covera model of decorative work  the secret rose literature r by w b yeats law t renee  bullen mr yeats has the courage of his celtic imagination if he thinks at this wrong end of a hardened century to arouse our slumbering saxon taste for allegory and symbolism though fashion of cynewulfs day is a little outworn and we have ceased to read guillaume de lorris with unaffected exhilaration yet here in an age of all the utilities is a young writer who invites us with though frank confidence of youth to follow him through the mystic byways of a new  roman do la rose it a fine enthusiasm for his theme could touch our hearts the appeal must surely strike homo but the hearts of some of us aro not in the right place and our heads are troubled with an intelligence a shade too analytic the authors heart is right enough  but he too suffers from the latterday trick of introspection it is the snare of even the greatest artists who imitate archaic forms or subjects dante eossetti in his ballads does not altogether escape it still less does tennyson in his  idylls of the king matthew arnold  perhaps least of all in his avowedly hellenic work such a passage as this from mr yeatss book may serve to show how the touch of a too modern spirit may hurt the harmony of oldworld sentiment   if you come with evil thoughts and armed men said the son of dermott flushing no matter how strong your hands to wrestle and to swing the sword it shall go badly with you for some of my wifes clan have come out of mayo and my three brothers and their servants have come down from the mountains of the ox  and while he spoke he kept his hand inside his coat as though upon the handle of a weapon 4 no answered costello  i but come to dance a farewell dance with your daughterthe girl lifted her eyes and gazed at costello and in her gaze was that trust of the humble in the proud the gentle in the violent which has been the tragedy of woman from the beginning the one word  tragedy7 quite apart from the sentiment of the conclusion imparts a disturbing element it has almost the air of modern literary slang again  costello led her among though dancers and they were soon drawn into the rhythm of though pa vaneand while they danced there came over them the unutterable melancholy though weariness with the world the poignant and bitter pity for one another the vague anger against common hopes and fears which is the exultation of love the reflection though it comes from the author and not from his characters is still a violation of unity an anachronism in sentiment a fault akin to this but less easily to be pardoned is seen in the absence of what for want of a better phrase may bo called the right local colouring let it be granted that mr yeats is sufficiently irish in his nomenclature and antiquities we have abundant local feeling in his namestho steep place of the strangers the lough of the little wood the town of the shelly river  every page is full of them there are also boreens and garrons and bodachs and other properly unintelligible celticisms but for all that we can seldom identify in his pictures the marks either of place or time we pass over a wide range of seasons from early christian times to at least the seventeenth century with scarce any sign to mark the change characters of all ages and conditions speak in much the same manner and if we except a desultory phrase or two their racial idiosyncrasies are but faintly revealed on the other hand it would be illnatured not to acknowledge our gratitude for being spared the local equivalent of the kailyard jargon but wo must revert to the question of symbolism for these tales pretend to mean more than mere tales of faerie mr yeats assures his readers in his dedication that they all have but one subject the war of spiritual with natural order and certainly in the broader issues of some of these stories the symbolic intention may be obvious yet when after the authors warning we search for esoteric interpretations in the multifarious details of his images the process is found to be futile and exhausting we are forced to give up the task and content ourselves with the human interest of the story itself which is often far to seek  or with the concrete beauty of his pictures or with the glow and grace of his eloquence but unhappily the high qualities of an eloquence which at its best has a conquering charm are not sustained had mr yeats brought to bear upon his work a keener sense of negative humour the absence of positive humour may be excused under the circumstances he would never have allowed us the shock of certain occasional lapses from the ethereal range of his poetic diction he would never have told us that  when they came to dermotts house they saw before the door an unusually large group of the very poor  or that margaret rooney had  some dilapidated remnants of tolerably good looks the bathos of such phrases can only bo appreciated by comparison with mr yeatss exalted manner purists as distinct from humourists may further complain of the fatal attraction of andto the relative in many places in this book rn finally after putting trivial blemishes a aside all who know anything of mr of yeatss exceptional ability as a poet will feel that in these prose stories he has not chosen the medium most suited to his remarkable powers now and again in a white heat of energy he  makes the live shape at a jet at other times he must himself be conscious that his material compels him to treat his themes too clearly and too explicitly to preserve the illusion of mystery as a writer of imaginative prose he takes high rank it is true among the men of our younger generation but as a poet of the school of shelley though author of  the wanderings of usheen stands alone some of the verses scattered about the present book are laboured in accentuation but he has proved sufficiently his mastery over form as well as matter and it is in the sphere of poetry rather than of prose that we look for the development of powers which promise a brilliant future it is to be hoped that there is no personal presage in his comment upon the works of certain authors found by him in the house of the order of  rosa alchemica where he says  i noted also many poets and prose writers of every age but only those who were a little weary of life as indeed the greatest have been everywhere and who cast their imagination to us as a something they needed no longer now that they were going up in their fiery chariots we know no young elisha who is quite prepared to assume the mantle of mr yeats,dom_contra

uninteresting story without a single possible character and with hardly one probable incident in it from beginning to end his tales of the turf have a decided fascination for a large class of readersto which we ourselves belongwho possess a secret awe and admiration for the mysteries of horseracing without being sufficiently initiated into the refined subtleties of the science to detect those slight technical inaccuracies with which we understand the writer of bound to win is occasionally taxed by the  cognoscenti as he styles them we however can only look on with wonder as at a snakecharmer while the gallant author fearlessly toys with his enigmatic array of dark horses  rortees knights of the pencil dumb jockeys and other such equine phenomena and a peep behind the impenetrable scenes of the turf is so gratifying that we will not allow our faith in oar guide to be shaken merely by a trifling skit in a comic contemporary the plot of the present work is one of those which only captain hawley smart can produce and its development affords great scope for his special talents by the provisions of a singular will the hero of the book harold luixmoore owner of some extensive racing stables is on pain of losing an estate and a bride bound to winti a certain derby au unscrupulous cousin next in the entail is thus interested on the other hand in preventing this happy consummation the efforts of these two young men to attain their respective objects form the story harold luxmoore is not a person of much importance in the book although presumably the hero he is rather passed over by the other characters even his own grooms appear to have but a small opinion of him and bestow their respect rather upon his friend the ihon jim laceby or the honble simply as the author usually styles him upon this last captain smart fairly lavishes his eulogieslie can hardly find words to express his admiration of this pet creation he tells us with tears of paternal pride in his eyes that no cooler man existed than the hlonble jimnor harder he could walk all day after grouse play whist all night and come down looking serene as if he had been put to bed with the children he would ride a fouryearold at an oxcr in the middle of a quick thing or stand a cracker on the favourite with equal placidity  he sometimes languidly murmured in the shibboleth he aflectcl that  lie had got it hot  come to grief  had a rosy time or something of that sort but his equality of temperament never seemed disturbed and yet according to his lights jim laceby was no fool the anticlimax here is certainly remarkable but the real attractions of the story in the way of hocussings  leaky stalles and  cooked favourites are heralded in by berkley holt the scheming cousin a goodlooking man about fiveandthirty of medium height with quick glittering lark eyes and a somewhat defiant manner the result of his doubtful position c this unprincipled youn man has on hand not only his own black plots against his relations derby prospects but also on behalf of a blighted admirer of harolds plans for preventing his marriage which involve the interception of letters c through the medium of a ladysmaid it seems to us a pity by the way that captain hawley smart should introduce the somewhat hackneyed and still more improbable incident of a spy contriving to conceal himself behind i conspicuous  straight tapestry screen some eight feet in height during a most important interview between two lovers we can hardly expect from a writer whose whole soul is bound up in the stable and paddock a very finished or lifelike picture of anything so unequestrian as an ordinary young lady all the gallant authors female portraits are thus somewhat unfinished while what there is

novels which all feel but nobody can describe professional critics the millhorses of the press wyho can acknowledgc excellencle in nothing that comes not within their owvn narrow circle of conventionalisms shake their heads at her and point to faults in plot or composition and  the silver fork school turn up their noses at maidservant heroines and adventures of low life but still the noncritical public caring nothing for reviewers and content to be pleased in spite of most unanswerable arguments why they shoulld not be pleased persist in reading and as they read unanimously they feel deeply interested and thenceforth  susan hopley and  lily dauson become not merely memories of tales that were told but beings whomn the reader has personally seen and talked with what is the secret of this charm  what are the characteristics of these fictions which baffle the sagacity of the selfappointed judges of literature  is there among the books most honoured in the library most universally loved any that resembles mrs crowes fictions in its quiet command of the readers fancyin its powver of selfembodiment and the hold it takes upon his curiosity yes there is one such book robinson crusoeand comparing its effect with the like effiect produced by the novels of mrs crowve it may not be i hopeless to trace the cause tihat charm then is not in the story nor in its personages lvut in the truthfulness of manner in the telling of it it is seen not onlu in  robinson crutsoe but in all the narratives of ldr xox wnho does not find it difficult to believe that  the lhishry of the plague is a fiction  it requires more efllbrt to convince oneself that 11obinson crusoes adventures are inventions than to assure oneself that the records of history are truths probably this is not the result of art but an unconscious faculty in the writers by which they are enabled so completely to realise their ideas that the pictures rise up in the minld perfect in the minutest details whereas the imaginations of ordinary writers are ratheroutlines than pictures so defoe describing the scene suggested by his own fancy presents not merely the prominent figures but objects the most minute and incidents seemingly the most trivial and these are introduced with no effort but simply as things to lie named because they were ot real occurrence and the fict would be incompletely told without them the effect of this minuteness upon the reader is to produce a thorough conviction of the truth of a story told with so much particularity lie asks as lie goes along  w ho would have thought of stating this why should such a particular be described if all is an invention seeing that it has nothing to do with the story  now it is only necessary to feel an assurance of its truth to take an interest in almost any narrative the doings and sufferings of our fellowcreatures have an irresistible charm for us a really faithful story of the life of the most obscure human being that ever lived would be the most interesting 1ook that ever wvas written this then is the secret of mrs cioiovs lolularity this was the charm that riveted the reader s attention from the frrst to the last page of  susn llopjhie and left him in doubt whether it was fact or fiction that had engrossed his fancy telle fame quality jervades this new  story of lily dawson like its predecessor it is a tale of low life the adventures of a girl brought up in a smugglers family and spectator of their crimes which beginningv with defrauding the revenue end in murder it is a fearful tale wrought with extraordinary power abounding in scenes that hold the breath in suspense and in hairbreadth scapes that keel the curiosity continually upon the stretch they who remember susan hopley and who does not will readily understand the effect with which our authoress yorks up situations of this sort we will not mar the absorbing interest of the story by anticipating it  it will be read and it deserves to be real by all who ever indulge in a novel it will not be less popular than its predecessors whether in its present form or moulded into a drama as doubtless it will be ere long it is one of the few novels that every circulating library however small may venture to order secure of a remunerating circle of readers and which every reader may venture to borrow certain that he will be amused in fairness to the authoress we take but a single passage from a scene in which the heroine narrowly escapes being murdered with which the second volume closes it is a good specimen of mrs croavens powers in such painting a murder she was still lying cogitating on these matters when she was startled by the creaking of the stairs and in a moment her ears were on the alert and her eyes straining to the door and presently the latch was very gently but audibly lifted and the door was slowly opened then there was a pause and then it was opened a little further and some one entered the room closing it very gently lily at first concluded that it was the woman returned although the movements were certainly very different for she had used no caution whereas this person seemed to be extremely fearful of disturbing her a mother entering the room of her sick infant on whose lids sat life and death at issue could not have moved more inaudibly but as the figure advanced into the room and crossed the faint ray of light that still gleamed from the opposite window where some low revellers of the night were congregated she fancied that she could distinguish that this was the figure of a man be it what it might however it was moving towards the bed and at length stood close beside her and there it paused a while lwhat mystery was this  who was this midnight visitor that trod with such a stealthy noiseless foot that she was satisfied he wore no shoes  was it luke  she thought it was and during that fearful pause w memories crowded on her what had become of amr rylna w hat of winny westons lover  what was the signification of the scene in her dead uncles chamber whilst she asked hersei these things she perceived the figure stoop ing over her bending gradually lower and lower as if listening for her breath which zitn endeavoured to the utmost to suppress so that apparently unabie to ascertain by what means whether the bed were tenanted or not a hand was gently laid upon the coverlet this experiment seemned to satisfy the man if man he were and he immediately reassumed an erect position then there was another pause during which lilly almost turned into stone with terror lay as motionless as the dead whilst there was some slight movement on the part of the man which terminated il a faint sound like the opening of a stiff claspknife the sound was familiar to her because her cousins had such instrumentsstrong knives with horn handles and two or three blades then she would have screamed  but she could not lift hier voice and at that instant she felt that something fell upon the bd  the man had dropped the knife  whereupon he put down his hard to seek it but it having fallen betwixt the folds of the coverlet he could not find it this lily understood from lis atiotns  and apparently restrainer from a more active search hv tie fear of awaking her after a momentsist s tttion hie turned about and still with the same inaudilde stvprs and cautious movements he quitted the room the moment the door was closed lily put out her hand and seized thu knife which having fallen upon her hal slipped over to the inner side of the bed which by the way we should haste remarked stood against the wall she had not been istkun it was ai she supposed a large claspknife oen it was therefore plain that the man whoever he was had come to murder her andl doubtless having obtained anotder vve p n he would return and execute hi design this  however she immediately thrust under the nattraiq wiiat elsiuld she do now  where cry for help  who was in the lvmne she knew not  perhaps nobody but this man and the wcepiunz womanbut could she aid her  wherefore had she best  perhaps for the victim she could not savethat she had l ayde conic to warn but dared not there was the window antd tile light in the opposite roomthere were livers thereand trembling like a leaf she got out of bed and crept towards it first she must throw it up  that would make a noise   suddenly another thought strnck hershe might get the key and lock the door from within that is if she durst but open itbut what if he were standing on the other side however this seemed her only chance as it would give her timie to open the window and call for help so she turned in that direction but before she reached it she became aware that a footstep was approaching and impulse now taking the command and deciding for hlar in an emergency that left no time for reflection she instantly retreated and took refuge under the bedthe only place of concealment that as far as she knew the room afforded she had scarcely reached her refuge when as she expected the door openedl and the man as she supposed entered but with less precaution than before the latch was lifted and the door was closed audibly enough  and the step across the room was audible too till it reached the side of the bed  now thought lilly he will miss me and seek me and he will find me too and i shall be dragged out and murdered her terror and agony were inexpressible a space however of some six orsevenminutesensued an age of anguishto herwhento her surprise sbefeltthe bed shake above her and it appeared that the person had stepped into it and lain down how strange was this the man or the woman or sorue other visitor  she would have given any thing to know  but till they slept at all events that was impossible without discovering herself which she durst not risk doing so almost frozen with fear and cold she remained quietly where she was listening to the breathing of the person above her whicb very shortly from the longdrawnout and heavy respirations betokened that they slept and now lily debated what she should do next if it were the man that was lying in the bed she must either have mistaken his inten tions or he must have changed them but in either case she so much dreaded being discovered by him that painful as her situation was she would prefer remaining in it till he quitted the room again to the risk of betraying herself if on the contrary it were the woman the best thing she could do would probably be to make her acquainted with the circumstance and seek her protection or advice then again if she were sure it was the man now that he was asleepif she were but sure of thatshe might possibly creep out of the room and lock him in but amongst these difficulties and uncertainties wrought up to a fearful pitch of agitation and terror by so many strange circumstances it was not easy for a timid irresolute inexperienced girl to decide so there she lay still doubting and fearing till the opportunity for action was lost heavily slept the sleeper upon the bed with a panting heart and straining ears for what should next ensue watched lily under it  nor did she watch in vain for now again the latch is gently stirred and someone enters slowly softly as before this was the man she was sure she recognised at once the difference betwixt his stealthy approach courting concealment and that of the woman which sought none isle was therefore come back to murder her oh  the horror the anguish of that conviction  silently and inaudibly as before he advanced towards the bed she ratherfelt than heard his foot it was more the vibration of the floor than her ear that enabled her to count hi steps northeast v he is beside the bedwhat will he do next ere he can do tiny thing the woman wakeshe had placed his hand upon her face and whilst she seeks to put it away she cries  whos there  there was no answer but a sound betwixt a cry and a groan for the breath seemed impeded and the bed shook as in a fearful struggle there were efforts to speak or to scream on the part of the woman and muttered curses on the part of the manand still the struggle continued  till suddenly there was a strange gurgling sound and then it ceased and there was silence some minutes elapsed and then the man quitted the room  the story of lily dawson trf story of  susan hopley at once raised its authoress mrs crowe into the first rank of domestic novelists and  lily dawson has sustained the preeminence so deservedly gained it is the story of a child who saved from a wreck boarded by smugglers was educated in igno rance and toil without knowledge of her parentage by a ruffianly crew who to preserve her in their power wish when she has grown up to womans estate to effect a compulsory marriage lilly however escaped as the companion of a blind beggar became a nurserymaid and then a milliners apprentice in the great metropolis and finally an attendant upon an invalided officer who turned out to be her lost parent it is however in the consuimnate art with which a character itself not very prepossessing is invested with interest in the power with which lie gradual awakening of sense and intellect from the prostration of servitude and tyranny is portrayed and in the life and character which is impressed upon each accessory character rather than in the mere

B7607,"['9443972', '9586879']",   the literary examer jj babaannanaan reuben medlieott or the coming man brm e savage esq author of  the bmmmit albany  my uncle the curate atlfi1 chapman and hall llm  reuben medlicott is defined by professor chatterton of the gentlemen with whom the readers of tinnier0118 fitable novel will become acquainted as the comis  who never comes full of promise in his

the fieldsof human exertit and to erect his house wherever it may please him to select domain that he will make his own he settles down tobum therefore in many places but before he has advanced mill higher than the first story of a house his humour chant and he shifts the development of his energies to other mound a great energy of talk being among reuben s properties thii grows upon him as his energies of action become less and less effective his infirmities increase upon him the quality of his talk deteriorates and the subjects among which his shifting enthusiasm travels become more absurd finally after missing halfadozen times the tide of fortune he falls to pieces stranded on the shore of active life he has always been the comiug man and nothing more the experiences of reuben medlicott form therefore as we hare said a novel very profitable to be read many a clever young reader will be all the better for this vigorous lesson from a practised pen on the necessity under which those lie who would do good to themselves or to society of first finding their true path and of then woiking vigorously forward on it without looking to the right hand or the left the high reputation obtained by the former novels of mr savage will cause the public to sit down with much expectation of a feast before the present volumes every one will know his host and be justified in expecting choice food and good cookery that the food is of the wholesomest we have already shown and that it is well presented we are quite able to testify in the first place however it must be understood tbt reuben medlicolt does not present the usual characteristics of a novel in respect of intricacy of plot breathlessness of interest narrowingness of tyrants and devotedness of brets mr savage divides his work into nine books prefaces each with an argument after the manner of fielding and has indeed constructed his narrative very much more after the humour of fielding who raised novelwriting to the dignity of epic poetry than in accordance with the custom of these later times fielding however never directed all the forces of a work to any one didactic purpose and in that respect mr savage has followed the humour of our modern school that good for everything means good for nothing is the moral chosen by the author of this book and his great care throughout is to enforce it thoroughly by all the resources of his humour wit and knowledge while he is carrying the reader through a series of scenes and working out a group of wellcontrasted characters among the characters of the book dean wyndham is especially to be remembered the hardheaded restless overbearing and ambitious polemic with his ttrlffl7fj generosity his learning and his mixture of wo7  and simplicity of heart is a

indications of it will be found in the succeeding extract which will introduce us also to the parents of reuben and his future wife  tbs dean was indeed the guest of canon old port at the time as mr broad and the vicar supposed the canon was an old bachelor abo had a tolerably good library and kept only toogood a table for between the sedentary habits of the student and the bonvicant he bad generally two fits of the gout in the year while in the intervals be waa ao afflicted with corns that in fact he might be said to pass bia whole life in his elbowchair accordingly being passionately fond of gossip and conversation he was always delighted when a neighbour or old college acquaintance dropped in to dine or spend a few dat with him his greatest friend was wyndham and yet the peso was so troublesome a guest that the canon was generally aa veil pleased when he left his house as when he came to it the dean turned every house he entered topsy turvy but he provoked oldport roost by his unceremonious way of tumbling about his books which kept the canon in a continual fret particularly as the dean never restored a volume to its place so that his friend was continually hobbling after him to keep his library in order one evening while toe dean continued oldport a guest it suddenly occurred to him to pay the medlicotts a visit and accordingly leaving the canon to drink his wine alone the thing of all others least agreeable to him dr wyndham took up his huge goldheaded cane tod strode across the fields to the vicarage he was a man of huge frame and gladiatorial muscle nature seemed to have designed him fer physical as well as polemical conflicts he valued himself indeed on his personal strength as much as upon his prowess in controversy and was particularly proud of his pedestrian powers he had each a pair of legs as hogarth would have given to an irish chairman er wilkie to one of the swarthy demonlike coalwhippers to be seen issuing frora those black arches in the strand which might well be imagined to form the regular communications between london and the aether world the vicar was watering his plants apparently screened from public coservation by a close

principia ill show you how to water when you think proper to let me in the vicar looked up and beheld the broad pugnacioua face of his wifes father with an immense aquiline note and an acre of wellhaven akin the whole overshadowed by a shovelhat with a particulady intolerant cock peering at him over the hedge which he waa veil able to do without atanding on tiptoe having hospitably welcomed his distinguished relative and visitor he ventured to observe goodhumouredly that he did presume to know something of a garden though he waa an humble vicar and had all his life been ready to receive instruction from any one who was so competent to afford it on moat subject aa the dean aa be spoke he hastened to open a small wicketdoor in the hedge to admit the dignitary who instantly thrust himself in stooping more than waa necessary and observing that it would not have coat five shillings more to have made the door a couple of inchea higher the vicar again meekly smiled and excused the door by observing that there waa not such a tall man as dr wyndham in the pariah of underwood or he believed in the diocese give me the wateringpot cried the doctor without noticing the vicars apology

observed a most servile silence some time elapsed before mrs medlicott succeeded in drawing her fathera attention to reuben and to the interesting fact that the very next day was fixed for his departure for school  so you are taking my advice at last you ought to have taken it long ago he cried addressing both parents but looking at neither which was no deviation from his ordinary manners

eating and sometimes during the process relating his own exploits at harrow and further to encourage reuben giving lively and forcible descriptions of the discipline which at that period was in vogue in most english seminaries of any notoriety reubens school days remind us of another point in which this novel is inadmissible mr savage has perfectly succeeded in truly representing the state of mind peculiar to boyhood and youth  at least so far as it concerns the depiction of a boy of cleverness and sensibility the sketch of reuben and of one or two of his schoolfellows up to the age of sixteen or seventeen is elaborate and masterly here are some pictures of reuben at a showy ball given by the barsacs who take care to patronise a select number of mr borough a boys the longexpected evening came at last and reuben found himself transported into the midst of a tumultuous assembly of welldressed people in the gay house of which he had so long desired to penetrate the interior except his schoolfellows he was acquainted with nobody there was nobody to tell him the name of any one which of the company were the barsacs or whether they were present or not he was in their bouse for an hour without knowing more than the man in the moon as the raying is he knew the ball had commenced by hearing the music feeling the floors vibrate and finding himself swayed to and fro occasionally by the movements of the dancers though he could scarcely see them he wondered what had become of winning and paid close attention to the ladies in white dresses among whom alone be expected to find miss blanche barsac so strongly had his grandfathers description of her affected his imagination suddenly his shoulder was tapped behind he turned about and found winning at his elbow  why are you not

replied winning little guessing reubens interest in the answer pale sherry was pale  but at the same time very pretty she was what people commonly called an interesting girl she had soft grey eyes which had a particularly earnest and devoted expression in them when she was talking to you which was very flattering and very fascinating besides she had a nice figure and a demure and composed manner which corresponded admirably with her pale complexion and soft eyes none of the barsac girls were mere girls the eldest was probably twentyseven and there was net more than three er four years difference in standing between the eldest and the youngest jf course it was condescending ef the angelic blanche to dance with a boy of thirteen but he was tall for his age aad she acted her part with perfect goodhumour and goodnature keeping him right in the figure as far as she could and trying te put kan as much at his ease aa possible both were dificult things to do t not onlj was reubens

previous works of the same writer have already taken a most honourable place  reuben medlicott or the coming mau by  m w savage 3 vols chapman  hall we are bound to state that mr savage does not improve as a novelist  my uncle the curate as the athentpum said on the occasion of its appearance ath no 1115 was a dull bookbut this is a duller onenot solely because of its subject but in part from the manner in which that subject is wrought out a narrative of foibles bearing bitter apples for fruitof hopes disappointed and promises unfulfilledcan rarely be very inspiriting yet miss edgeworth in her stories of vivian the persuadable man and of basil lowe the procrastinator knew how to administer such relief and contrast that we could read those admirably executed tales without our hopes in humanity being chilled and without our views of life becoming pinched and dwarfed by reason of the low and waste monotony of the prospect within which they were confined it may be recollected that we object to mr thackeray as to a novelist who deals too grudgingly with all that is amiable and elevated  but even into his most discouraging scenessuch for instance as the surprise of becky over her petit soaper with lord steynehe will every now and then throw a touch of strong feeling and human interest now we have met with few writers who scatter their amenities so sparingly as mr savage without commanding de balzacs force or minuteness he has all de balzacs dreariness his story contains a character and exhibits a complete picturebut the person selected is singularly unpleasingand the fulllength gallery picture has not an inch of blue sky or an episode of flowervase in the background by way of relief failure at schoolfailure at collegefailure in parliamentfailure at the barfailure in platform oratoryfailure even in the quaker asceticism through which the coming man passes as one phase of his many changes such are the incidents of mr selvages book reuben medlicott has many showy qualities and gracious gifts but he is as unstable as water and as vain as a foolish french beauty of the ancien regime such a hero mr savage may rest assured would never have married the daughter of the quaint old dissenting dame from whom he had his schooling nor is there any one character in the book which may serve as a foil to the hero in right of extraordinary gifts or virtues his mother is foolish his father is a nonentityhis aunt is weak the idol of his schoolboy days marries his grandfatherhis favourite associates a french shoemaker and a sister are not much better than they should be the descriptions are more smart than strongmore diffuse than impressive we select one of the best and most manageable scenes a protestant meeting at chichester all tremendous demonstrations resemble one another very closely an excited knot of noblemen and gentlemen on a platform a tumultuous sea of heads on the floor an agitated bevvy of mothers aunts and sisters in a gallery a little table for reporters a peer in the chair if a peer can be found to fill it but never anything beneath the baronetage on the present occasion the platform was thronged with parsons and squires until it overflowed and every now and then a vicar or a pair of topboots came tumbling down among the smockfrocks who united their shoulders to heave him up again when this disaster befell a man of ordinary dimensions he was reinstated on the platform with no great difficulty  but when it happened to public characters of more than average weight the attempt to replace them sometimes proved as ineffectual as in the case of the celebrated humpty dumpty in the nursery rhyme it was unquestionably a  tremendous demonstration of the lungs of the men of sussex john bull bellowed like a herd of his fourfooted namesakes and the protestant lion roared his best without the slightest respect to the nerves of though ladies bottom would have been greatly scandalised awful resolutions were proposed by peers and seconded by commoners but as to the eloquence it was uniformly stifled by its own applause and perished for ever in the premature raptures of the audience it was proved however beyond a doubt that there were two curtii present ready to jump into any chasm which the british soil might please to open beneath their feet a brutus in buckskin was equally prepared to sacrifice all the private affections to the public welfare  as to sydneys hampdens and russells they appeared that day in a force that reflected undying honour upon the patriotism of englishmen how often popery was flatly negatived with the energy of cromwell himself is not to be told in figures but three orators at least pledged their lives and fortunes to defend the throne and the altar the same number of prophetic voices foretold the sunset of british liberty and thrice three times was it powerfully urged upon thc vast assembly to unite heart and hand in a  strong pull a long pull and a pull altogether in the front of the gallery assigned to the ladies who came to brave the roaring of the lion aforesaid sat mrs medlicott and hannah and mary hopkins their eyes were riveted on the platform but it was not on the chairman they gazed although he was the earl of stromness nor on the vicar for he was lost in the crowd nor on mr pigwidgeon ludicrous figure as he cut for there was no novelty in that you had only to watch the point where the three lines of female vision united to convince yourself that they sought nothing saw nothing thought of nothing during that great day and demonstration but the youngest of thc patriot band he who came to dedicate the firstfruits of his talents and his fame to the service of his creed and his country probably few of the ladies present had been unobservant of reuben from un early period of the day for he was conspicuous not only by his heindsome person but by his dress which could scarcely have been gayer or more elaborate had he been going to be married instead of only going to make a speech his hair artfully divided thone like apollos and flowed on his shoulders almost as wantonly as in his boyhood a bouquet nearly as large as barsacs bloomed in his buttonhole and the virgin whiteness of his gloves typified the maiden eloquence with which ho was about to enchant the world the foppery was not entirely his own  the gloves were due to his mother the flowers had bein insisted on and even arranged on his breast by the young quakeress nor was it amiss that so much care had been bestowed on his toilette for had he been confounded with the parsons nnd the squires his rising would not have commanded the attention that it did and his oratory would probably have been lost like that of the rest in the incessant uproar of the meeting everything however was propitious but perhaps most of all the emphatic and gracious manner in which the earl of stromness a man of the highest courtesy introduced him to the audience as  the son of his respected friend the rev thomas medlicott instantly the chawbacons hundreds of whom were the earls tenants raised a shout that well nigh brought down the roof of the courthouse the 4m was little in unison with the modesty and gentleness with which the palpitating reuben took his place in the front of the platform his rising was soft as the south wind  and you might have marked its effects in the female gallery how the breeze fluttered the bonnets rustled among thc ribbons and especially how it made the maternal stomacher risc and fall like a sail when the wind is irresolute he rose he spoke he triumphed his was the only speech that was not only delivered but of which a considcmble portion was heard a most excellent speech it was of the school of oratory it belonged to though there were principles of eloquence by which it would have been cruel to have tried it if however it had the defects of youth it had its merits also it was fresh it was fury it was animated and courageous there was not a quintilian in the meeting to find fault with it tried by the test of success not demosthenes himself could have gained a completer victory up hew a cloud of hats before the exordium was over the orator was actually invisible for a second though same demonstration was repeated a score of times upon one occasion mr pigwidgeon who was striking another stroke for a dinner must throw up his beaver among the rest and he never recovered it for it fell among the mob and was trampled to pieces in an instant the hat was not worth sixpence but he vowed it was a new onea thing he had never been known to possess in his life what signified lr pigwidgeona hat or mr pigwidgeon himself even protestantism was forgotten in the excitement and enthusiasm occasioned by the bowers of reubens rhetoric not unaided by the flowers in his coat if one passage outshone another where all was splendour it was the dangerous topic of apostacythe graphic picture of a renegade divine which reached its climax when the orator described the vain endeavours of such a sillen character to regain his lost position and imagined thc reception he would assuredly meet with from every honest man here he turned to good account the lines in milton  thinkst thou revolted spirit thy shape thu same or undiniinishd glory as when once thou stoodat erect in henvn erect and pure the air was darkened with waving hats again thc enthusiasm mounted to though galleries the women waved their handkerchiefs wildly and mrs medlicott and the quakeresses who had taken ort their bonnets in consequence of the heat tossed them about fanatically and almost forgot their sex in the violence of their transports in short it was a relief to everybody when though last bolt was launched and the last longprotracted peal of applause greeted the solemn and highwrought peroration the above passage we think will be found to illustrate within itself at once mr savages strength and his want of strength in fact this second disappointment convinces us that the threevolume novel is not our authors forte the sharp clever sketch  the short philosophical tale in which want of incident is forgiven for the sake of pithy

good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to

sketchy details of a tour from windsor to shellurne along the coast to halifax the clockmaker is a keen shrewd pene trating fellow his observations are striking and often imply more than may be at first actually inferred and his ideas of slavery canadian affairs smuggling c c are peculiarly original and felicitous the following extract may be taken as a specimen of the more serious portions of the work  there is a strong similarity between the native and his climate the one is without youth and the other without spring and both exhibit the effects of losing that preparatory season cultivation is wanting neither the mind ior the soil is properly prepared there is no time the farmer is compelled to hurry through all his field operations as he best can so as to commit his grain to the ground in time to insure a crop much is unavoidably omitted that ought to be done and all is perfermed in a careless and slovenly manner the same haste is observable in education and is attended with similar effects a boy is hurried to school from school to a profession and from thence is sent forth into the world before his mind has been duly disciplined or properly cultivated when i found mr slick at windsor i expressed my regret to him that we could not have met earlier in the season  but really said 1 they appear to have no spring in this country   well i dont know said he  i never

london  the clockmaker  or the sagings and doings of samuel slick of sliehvile second series bentley sam slick as our readers will no doubt remember is an old acquaintance athen no 11 but his introduction to and hearty reception in london has we observe had its infhiiiices on his opinions though but little on his manners and languageso far indeed is he now from depreciating every thing british that he is content with an occasional outbreak about the greatest nation on earth and is hardly distinguishable from an englishman of a particular class and caste except that he utters his wisdom in a language not quite familiar to the commonality either of st jamess or st giless lie is however still remarkable for shrewd obser vation common sense and odd quaint humour here is a touch of his philosophy   happylookiu critter aint he with that are little short black pipe in his mouth  the fact is squire the moment a man takes to a pipe he becomes a philosiferits the poor mans friend it calms the mind soothes the temper and makes a man patient under trouble it luis made more good men good husbands kind master indulgent fathers and honest fellers than any other blessed thing in this tinivarsal world the indgians always buried a pipe and a skin of tobacco with their folks in case smokin should be the fashion in the next world that they mightnt go unprovided gist look at him his hat has got no crown in it and the rim hangs loose by the side like the bale of a bucket his trousers and jacket are all living in tatters of diilereiit cohuird patches isle has one old shoe on

great high tory and a republic smells so bad in his notiils hes got his nose eurld up like a pugnoe dog till thro his jouriiev isle secs no established chinch and he swears theres no religion  and he secs no livery helps and he says its all vulgar and if he sees a citizen spit he jumps a one side as scared as if it wor a rifle agoin off then comes a radical and them english radicals are cantankerouslookiu crittersthats a fact as sour as vinegar and lookin as cross and as hungry as a bear gist starved out in the spring and they jay we have the slavery of opinion here  that our preachers want moral courage and that our gnat cities are cursed with the aristocracy of wealth there is no pleasin cither on vin then come what minister used to call the optimists a set of folks who talk you dees about the perfectibility of human natur that men like caterpillars will all turn into beautiful critters with wings like but ter hiesa sort of grub angels that our great nation is a paradise and our folks gist gettin out o the chrysolis state into something divine i seldom er never talk to none o them unless it be to bani vin they think they know everything and all they got to do is to up hudson like a shot into the lakes full split off to mississippi and down to new orleens full chisel back to new york and up hillockand homo ina liner and write a book they have au bolo stock

then out comes a book if its a tory writes it then the tory paper says its the best pictur they have seenlively interestin intelligent if a radical then radical papers say its a very philosophical work whenever a feller gets over his head in it and cruel unintelligible hes deep in philosophy that chap statesmanlike view able work throbs great light on the polities of the day i wouldnt give a chaw oftobackey for the book of all ofem tied up and put into a meal hag together miss marlineau of course comes in for move than her fair proportion of his scorn   year afore last i met an knglish gall a travellin1 in a steam boat she had a french name that t cuat recollect tho i got it on the tip o my tongue too you know who i meanhe wrote book on economynot domestic economy as galls ought but on political economy as galls oughteiit tor they dont know nothin about it sin had a trumpet in her handthinks i who on airth is she ngoin to hail or is she agoin to try echoes on the river i watched her for some time and i found it was an ear trumpet well well says i thats onlike mot english travellers any way for in a giniral way they wear magnifying glasses and do enlarge thing so a body dont know vin again when he see vin now this gall wont hear one half thats said atil will got that half wrong and so it turned out sivmie tomi beautiful country this mr slid says ike im transported transported said i why what nuder the sun did you do to home to get transported  but slit larlel light out like any thing delighted i mean said she its so beautiful it is splendid said i no doubt there aint the beat of it to bj found any where oh  said she what views what scenery what woods what a liver how i hoilii like to soar away up with that are eagle into the blue sky and see all its beauties spread out afore nie like a map how grandeverything is on a grand scale have you seen the kentuckians saith i not vet said she stop then said i till you see mew they are on a scale that will please you i gue whopping big fellows them i tell you  half hors half alligator with a touch of the airthquake i want a talking of the nun said he tis the beauties of natur i was admiring well said i once on a time i used to admire the be uties of naturtoo but i got cured of that sit down on thi bench said she and tell mellow it wasthee kind oanecdotes serve to illustrate the  moral of feelin thinks i this is philosophy now  moral of teeliu well if the mosehetoes dont illustrate your moral of feeling for you some of thee nights im nilstakcn very immoral fellows those skeeter here the reader must excuse us from interrupting the clockmaker hut his illustrative anecdotes are not always fitted for ears polite  w arter a considerable of a pause ahe said this must be a religious country said she aint it  fr religion is thc highest fact in mans right and the root of all democracy if religion is the root of democracy said i it bears some strange fruit sometimes as the man said of the pine tree the five gamblers were lynched up to vixburg    if you was to revarse that maxim o yourn said i and say democracy is too often found at the root of religion youd he nearer the mark i reckon i knew a case once exactly in point do tell it tome said he it will illustrate the spirit of religion yes said i and illustrate your book too if you are a writinone as mot english travellers do our congregation said i at slickville contained most ofthe wealthy and respectable folk there and a most powerful and united body it was well there came a plit once ou the election of an elder and a body ofthe uppercrust folks separated and went off in a huff like most folks that separate in temper they laid it all to conscience  found out all at once they had been adrift afore all their lives and joined another church as differed from ourn in creed as chalk is from cheese and to show their humility hooked on t  the poorest congregation in the place well the minister was quite lifted up in the stirrups when he saw these folks gino him and to show his zeal for them the next sunday he looked up at the gaery to the niggers and said bc my brethern said be i beg you wont spit down any more on the aisle seats for there be gentlemen there now gist turn your heads my sable friends and let go over your shoulders manners my brothers manners before buckey well the niggers seceded they said it was an infringement on their rights on their privelege of spittin as freemen where they liked how they liked and when they liked and they quit in a hotly  democracy said theyis the root of religion ls that a fact said she no mistake said i  i seed it myself i know viii all well its a curious fact said she ami very illustrative it illustrates the universality of spittin and the universility of democracy its characteristic i have no fear of a people where the right of spittin is held sacred fi oin the interminable assaults of priestcraft there is a great deal of sad truth in the following sketchnot with especial reference to the slave trade of course but generally  i  i have licenl til said he that you british have ia nc ip i ted your niggers yes aid i thank god  shivery exists not iu the british empire well i take some credit to myself for that said the clockmaker it was me that sot that nguiu any way you  said 1 with the most unfeigned astonishment yoi how could you by any possibility be instrumental in that great national net i well ill tell yam said he tim its a considerable of a long story too when i returned from poland via loudon in the liiiir speckelation of jabish green i went down to shetlietd to execute a commission    when i was down there a gentleman called on me one afternoon ont john canter by name and ays he mr slick ive called to see you to make some inquiries about america  me and my friends think of emigratin there   i was born a quaker mr slick llenty of vin with us says i and well t do in theworld tooconsiderable stiff folks in their way them quakerswell lately ive dissented from eui say hecurious that too says i i was a thinkin the beaver didnt shade the inner man quite iis much as  have seed it but says i i like iisent  it shows a man has both a mind and ii conscience too if he hadnt ii mind he couldnt dissent alni if he hadnt ii conscience he wouldnt a man therefore who quits his church always stands a notch higher with me than a stupid obstinate critter that stick to it cause he was born and brought up in it and his father belonged to ittheres no sense in that a quaker is a very set man in his way  a dissenter therefore from a quaker must be what i call i considerabl ufaobstinate man says he larfn no says i not gist exactly that but be must carry a pretty tolerable stiff upper lip tho thats a fact wellsays he mr slick this country i a aristocratic country a very aristocratic country indeed and it tante easy for ii man to push himself win a he has no great friends or family interest and beide if a mau luis some little talentsays he and he squeezed his chin between his torefinger and thumb as much nato savtho i sav it that shouldnt say it i haven very tolerable share of it at any rate he has no opportunity of risin by hringin himself afore the public every avenue is filled a mt has no chance to come forwardmoney wont do it for that i havetalent wont do it for the opportu nity is wantin i believe ill go to the states wher all men tyre equal and one has neither the trouljlj of risin nor the vexation of fatlin then youd like to come forward in public life here would vou said i if you had

london bentley tm  clockmaker is alxvays welcome  and even the squire whose political philosophy recalls the days of innocence and of our grandmother and is enunciated with a pompous emphasis that reminds us of the dear old lady herselfeven he is amusing it may be said that sams peculiar phraseology has lost its interest with its noveltythat he now talks too frequently on subjects he doc not understand  but then his j illustrations are so apt homely and quaint j hrs humour so odd outoftheway and genii j winehis sketches of manners so vigorous and lifelike though not alxvays like lifethat

history i do know a little of for i lamed woodbridges epitome to school and the bible and the history of our revolution i know by heart from paradise to lexinton and from bunkers hill to independence lint i do suppose i must rub up a little on the passage musick i dont fear much for i rather pride myself on my ear and my voice and psalmody i lamed to singin schools  so operas and theatres will soon set me right on that but danciu is what i can take though  shine off most folks in i was reckoned the supplest boy in all slickville mams the time i have danced i  possum up a gum tree at a quiltm frolic or lmkin party with a tumbler full of cider on my head an never spilled a dropi have upon my soul isle then got up and executed several evolutions on though  floor which would have

embark on board thc uritish queen before wo have fairly started from nova scotia without wasting time then iu leave taking and preparations let us be off at once  when the little light travellingwaggon was driven round from the coachyard i was delighted to see that the clockmaker had brought his favourite horse old clay with bim come step in squire siiid he as he held the reins old clay is apawing ind achawing like mad  be wants to show you though xvay to windsor and be is jist the boy that can do it hold up your head my old jratfe said he and make the folks a bow  its the last time you will ever see them in all your born days and now off with you as if you was in rael wideawake airnest and turn out your toes pretty xever stop for them idle critturs that stand starin in the road there as if they never seed a horse afore but go right over them like wink my old snort for youll be to conneticut afore they can wake up the crowner and summon a jury  know theres no occasion to hurry tho at that rate or youll set my axle afirc there that will do now jist fourteen miles an hour i dont calculate to drive faster on a journey squire for it sweats him and then you have to dry him arterwarda afore you xvater him so there is nothing gained by it aint he a horrid handsome horse a most endurin quickster a rael salt thats all he is the prettiest piece of flesh and bone ever bound up in horse hide what an eye he has you might hang your hat on it and then his nostrils  lord they open like the mouth ofa speakin trumpet he can pick up miles on his feet and throw em behind him faster than a steam doctor araciu off xvith another mans xvife there noxv squire aint that magnificent you can hear him but cant see him  he goes like a bullet out ofa lille xvhen its dander is up aint he a xvhole team that and a horse to spare absquotilatc it in stile you old skunk from a squerrels jump to the eeiul of the chapter and shoxv the gentleman what von can do anybody could see he aint a bluenose cant they for cuss em they dont know how to begin to go trot xvalk or gallop is all the same to him like talkin drinkin or tighten to a human lord i have a great mind to take him to kngland jist for the fun ofthe thing for i dont knoxv myself xvhat lie can do when he has done his best there is alxvays a mile im hour more in him to spare there is upon my soul but it tidies a niau to mount him only tonkin at him goin makes your head turn round like giindin eotfee  xvhat xvould ridin him do  sam has it appear given up patriotism and politics there is nothing he linds  so xvell taken care of as your rights and privileges there are alxvays plenty of chaps volunteering to do that ile however acknowledges that hu once baila little ambition that xvay   i shall never forget the day i xvas elected i felt txvo inches taller and about a little the biggest nulli in all sliekville i knexv so much xvasexpected of mn i couldnt sleep atryin to make speeches and xvhen i was in the shop i spiled half my xvork by not bavin my mind on it  i must say that day xvas the happiest one of my life i felt full of dignity and honour and xvas tilled with visions of glory to come well says i to myself the great gu wc is noxv lo be played in rael airnest and no mistake  what caril shall i piny the presidential chair and the highest posts is open to me in common xvitli other citizens what is to prevent nie aciiuiii iii ba honours or if i have good nek  the odd trick what shall i lead if with i  laid axvake all night coiisiderin of itarnllin and atossiu over like cramp in the stomach not knowin xvhat to do  at last 1 got an idea intension tf suffrage says i is the card ill play that will take the musses and masses is power for majorities rules at that time squire xve hail the forty shilling freehold qualification and it extended no farther so i went for universal sulfragc  for thinks i if i can carry that i ear go for governor first on the strength of the nexv votes and president afterxvards and it did seem plausible enough too thats a fact to all appearance it xvas the best card in the pac so out i jumps from bed axvalkin up and down the room in my shirt tail aworkin a xvay at my speech like anything and dreadful hard xvork it was too for it is easier to forge iron any time than a speech especially if you aint broughten up to the business i had to go over it and over it ever so often for every now and then ide stick fast get botheredand forget xvhere i xvas and have to begin agin but when day xvas een about breakin i xvas j list draxvintoa close and had nearly scored and rougbliewd it out when all ofa sudden i run agin the bedpost in the dark and nearly knocked my brains out well next night i worked at it agin only i left the candle burnin so as not to be astumblin up agin things that xvay and the third night i got it all finished off complete but i got a sliockincold iu my head axvalkin about naked so and felt as xveak as a child for want of sleep i xvas awful puzzled to fix on xvhat to do on account of that plaguy cold i didnt know whether to xvait till it got better or strike xvhile the iron xvas hot and liissin for i xvarnt sure some o the speech xvouldif t leak out or the xvhole get flat if 1 kept it in too long so as soon as the house opened i makes a plunge right into it for what must be must be and its no use a coiisiderin  sam of course broke down  behind the scenes is another capital paper av hen sam waa courting sy tupper the whalers daughter he chanced to meet major bradford who  pisoned his mind agin the gall and then

that dont seem kinder nateral now does it major xatcral said he what the devil luis natur got to do with it  if she followed natur she wouldnt wear nothin at all custom bas given women petticoats and men pantaloons but it would be jist as nateral for women to wear the breeches and the men the apronstring and there is a plaguy sight of them do it too say it aint modest and i wont nonconcur you but dont talk about natur for natur has no hand in it at all it has neither art nor part in it itt no rate   well i never was to ii theatre afore in all my life fur minister didnt approbate them iit no rate and he wouldnt never let me go to em to sliekville  so thinks 1 to myself 1 dont care if i do go this once it cant do me no great barm i do suppose and a gall in tights is something new so here goes and 1 turns and walks lockandlock with him down to the playhoiisc well 1 must say it xvas a splendid sight too the house was chock full of company all best out to the very nines and the lamps was as bright as day and the music was splendid thats a fad for it was the black band of the militia and them blinks have most elegant ears for music too i tell you and when they struck up our

a leetle fancy to on thc stage she was so uncommon spry and active took a hym lep light into the middle of the room and lit doxvn on ono foot and then balancin herself as she did on though stage xvith her hands stretched the other foot axvay out ever so far behind her well arter perchin that xvay a intuit or so as a bird does on a sprig ofa tree she sprung agin right forrard and brought herself

startling enough there is nothing improbable about them still we must receive themn with caution that excellent woman mrs c m kirkland he writes said to the author shortly after the fall of fort sumter if you cannot shoulder a musket you can blow a bugle the book before us is the bugle and the blast against slavery blown from it is very lond indeed in mr fairfaxs  elopement which we noticed in the londox revivw may 16 an attempt and not an unsuccessful one was made to show how little practical sympathy for the degro exists in the northern states but though the writer vehemently pressed his argument he was unable to conceal that while the condition of the slave in the southern states under a benevolent proprietor is far better than that of the free negro in the north nothing can be more wretched than his case if he has the misfortune to belong to a savage mrs fanny kembles residence in georgia which we reviewed in our number of the 6th of june gave us a picture of slavelife on an estate which had the reputation of being humanely managed making allowance for the colouring which a woman possessed of strong feelings and considerable eloquence could not help ging to such a subject the facts which she recounted materially affected our estimate of the creature comforts enjoyed by the slave even under a kind uster the book before us written with strong abolitionist ypathies leads us to believe that humane as mrs kembles husband may have been his estate did not resent a fair specimen of slavelife in the south when mitigate by the benevolence of the owner mr kirkes desrptio xy sother fremda by bdaund kirao autor of asu th phos low son x of the slaves on mr prestons estate shows us the northeast pbis ultra of negro happiness in the south and from the picture he has drawn of their comforts and the paternal care of their owner we are induced to believe that he has blown his bugle more in sorrow than in anaer unfortunatelyr this term  paternal care  has a double imieanimg that a man shall have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing her husbands attachment to his offspring by phyllis by parting with her trinkets kirke and preston find phyllis while she is yet in the hands of the slavetrader at a village store in north carolinah er figure was slight and graceful and her face very beautiful she bad long black glossy hair straight regular features a rich olive complexion and large lustrous eyes which as she sat opposite the open door were fixed on the thick gloomy wood with an earnest almost agonised gaze as if she were reading in its tangled depths the dark uncertain future that lay before her never shall i forget the expression of her face never have i seen its look of keen intense agony and its full perfect utter despair one of the children was a little girl of eight years with a sweet hopeful expression a clear rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons plantation near newbern here we find that prestons humanity to his slaves is ruining him and that with a hundred and fifty darkies he is going to the dogs while a certain colonel dawsey with only seventyfive works his estate at a profit preston explains how the colonel is so successfuldawsey has seventyfive slaves forty childbearing women twenty men and fifteen children under five years the sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their children and the waking rest necessary to working people he never whips them on a weekday because it wastes working time but makes sunasy a general flogging season he has two women where he has one man and each woman is expected to bear a child every second year if she doesnt she is sold they are made to work in the field till the labour pains are on them and arm allowed only two weeks res ar confinement three of them have born children in the woods this season he keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children and as soon as each child is five years oldthe ag at which it can be legay sold awra from its motherit is disposed of to the trades in addition three of these women are his mixtresse and they must bave children as fast as the others he serves their children like the rat that is rears them to the age of five and then sells them as he would so many hogs mr kirke does not confine himself to details which tell against slavery his deseption of ms preston shows how the highest womanly qualities can flourish side by side with the most hateful of social institutions she was a perfect womana faithful mistress a loving wife a devoted mother an every want of her husband rully inscting breon overseeing every detail of her oueod ueting out th red allowance of the negroes viting daily the cabins of the ad the infi d with hw own d ds u om s ing or the king m iineor whm an

beautiful with human love suich women mr kirke writes are seen nowhere more often than in the south her husband too was solicitous for the religious wellbeing of his slaves his connexion with phyllis had terminated with his conversion to nobler thoughts and he taught his slaves their catechism and regularly attended the ministrations of the negro preacher old joe his grandfathers son by one of the old reprobates slaves side by side with the negros pitiable condition there is a vein of irresistible grotesqueness running through his life in nothing nmore remarkable than in his religious exercises joe had a rival in his clerical vocation a negro named jack whose gift was prayer and whose predilection was whisky the predilection was necessary to the full development of the rift mr kirke went to hear him open the sunday service gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment he drawled out my bredrin less us raise our hearts ter de lord the whiuce congregation then kneeled and jack closing his eyes clenching his hands together and throwing his bead back until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building  lifted up his voice and prayed  after the fashion of very many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob

how all his descendants have taken after him and been mighty big sinners ever since  then he described the sinner particularly the black sinners preeent and if half of what he said was tie every one of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed frank and selma to the family pew tittering laughing and flaunting their redandyellow kerchiefs the black people were enjoying themselves amazingly when  dar dey comes darm de happy pussons went round the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand

subsided to a dead calm those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all the responses with great propriety but some of the congregation seemed less familiar with the service when joe repeated the words if any man kin show cause why dese olks should

followed by a dance in which master joe prestons son1 makes himself conspicuous as roseys partner in one of the sets for his marvellous dancing but when the young mother is confined her child is white

the illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread it,dom_contra
B4305,"['9025936', '6650880']",  ginxs baby his birth and other misfortunes our library table strahan  co the author of  ginxs baby has wished to give good advice for the moral maladies under which society labours and he has enveloped it in a kind of jocosity which as often happens in the case of medicines for children is little fess distasteful than that which it is intended to sweeten moreover the comic element is so awkwardly mingled with the serious that its purpose is betrayed at once and we are repelled instead of attracted the story if we may so call it which serves as sweetening to the preaching is as follows  ginxa less grotesque name would have served the authors purpose equally well it is not funnyis a navvy and the baby is his thirteenth child on the birth of the twelfth ginx had vowed to drown the next and proceeds in due course to carry out his vow he is met as he goes to vauxhall bridge by various people among them a philosopher which gives the opportunity for a lecture on malthusianisma subject quite proper in its due place but liable to become improper if treated jocosely the baby is ultimately rescued by a man who takes him to a convent of course the nuns and their confessor have names which are meant to be funny but only succeed in being foolish from the convent he is taken by the protestant association and we have a little chaff of exeter hall and ito proceedings but we will not pursue ginxs baby through his varying career suffice it to say that after being exposed several times in the streets taken to workhouses and rejected by them he at last is adopted by the reform club becomes a page bolts with the spoons and ends by the very fate from which he had been rescued in infancy for he drowns himself from vauxhall bridge we are left somewhat in doubt aa to the panacea which the author himself would recommend for our social ailments  it is either a scheme of emigration or an alteration in the law so as to enable parents to drown their superfluous children from the general tone of the book we should say he means to suggest the former course but on the other hand a remark at the end of the book together with the catastrophe itself incline us to decide for the other we see all rights are reserved including we presume that of dramatising the story now if we may be allowed to advise this is what the author should do let him recast it in a dramatic form leaving out most of the moral part and introducing an immoral part let us say a byplot of an intrigue between sir charles sterling and sister something in the convent get one or two set scenes of vauxhall bridge by moonlight and such like and send it to the theatre if it does not in that form draw crowded houses for six monthswell we shall have our opinion of the modern taste in dramatic matters enormously increased  inxs baby his birth and other misfortunes strahan and co i london 1870 what a london navvy earning eighteen shillings a week ought to find society prepared to do with his thirteenth baby is a question easier asked than answered the historian of the son of ginx is rather severe upon the philosopher the police force the charitable agencies the parish authorities and the club politicians who somehow fail to make life pleasant to his hero  yet they do more for him than for the twelve brothers and sisters who were never threatened with drowning and are guiltless so far as the author explains of any sins of commission which should leave the infant like douglas jerrolds st giles no choice but to grow up in criminal habits to begin at the beginning a wandering malthusian suggests that on the whole ginxs baby had better not have been born he is suppressed by public opinion with a confused sense that the domestic virtues of ginxpadre and mere are on the whole beneficial to the community a relieving officer quotes not wholly unreasonable acts of parliament which constrain the reluctant father to maintain not drown his superfluous offspring the nuns who take the infant in hand next decline on reflection to provide for his body unless they may work their will on his soul a tedious satire on the  protestant detectc al association  is meant to show that charitable organisations have gaps through which any number of units may slip unseen to distress then it is the turn of the poor law guardians who seize the first opportunity of returning ginxs baby on the hands of ginx who deposits it on the threshold of a club in pall mall and emigrates here the authors case begins to break down the club adopts ginxs baby it is fed and clothed and moralised about till it is fifteen and if it is also petted and snubbed by turns that fate is not peculiar to foundlings that it should elope with some spoons instead of donning the livery of one of its patrons and finally commit suicide because it hadnt been murdered in infancy is mere matter of temperament whilst social satire is supposed to deal with types the author of ginxs baly feels strongly on some very important questions and has a fund of righteous indignation at the disposal of those who answer them amiss but his criticism would be fairer if hie did not try to cut up every body in a breath and especially if he would pass by the too obvious occasions for smart writing afforded by newspaper grievances h lawrenny,dom_contra
B6013,['8965023'],  the siege of florence an historical romance by daniel mcarthy ksq  vols colhurn in the notice of mrs gores  dowager we took occasion to call the attention of our readers to the present state of literature iu its moro popular departments and to its intimate connexion with certain particulars in the actual phasis of societya truth as we conceive of primary importance and hitherto much overlooked of these particulars the most remarkable perhaps is the increased demand for books and a consequent rapidity of intellectual productions among the many influences exerted by this cause there is one suiliciently obviousami that is a proportionate exhaustion affecting at  once the imagination of though author and the exi citability of the public it is not that the comi binations of nature or of society when measured  against human power are practically less than i infinite or that under any circumstances newfields would be waining to the operations of genius imt then it is genius alone that can  discover them md genius is not to be cleated at pleasure by a mere demand for its exercise when hoxvever inventive genius docs arise and it has extorted from society an approbation for its novelties they are seized upon forthwith by a host of innovators the forms are multiplied and the beauties frittered away in endless repetitions each for the most part differing from its predecessor only in thc inferiority of its execution the nexv form is no sooner recognized than it is worn to a thread  or if in a few splendid and exceptional cases superior p o xve rs  of combination are manifested they are still  manifested to a disadvantage for the public satiated with the overwrought model responds  not to the stimulus and receive with indilleri euee excellencies which formerly would have obtained signal success this forms a state of things equally irksome to both parties and both endeavour to escape from it through channels unfavourable to thc best interests of literaturethat is through an abandonment of simplicity and truth and the search after monstrous excitements from the most illegitimate sources there is on the part of the public a demand for what may bc termed a literary draindrinking and on the part of authors and cf publishers there is not wanting it corresponding eagerness to work thc illegal still and to serve the hot and poisonous product as much above proof as the strength if their alembic will admit it is the curse of all vicious excitement to provoke a desire for perpetually increasing stimuli and in the search after the means of gratifying this desire authors are bent on outdoing at all risks the former outdoiugs of their predecessors one writer labours to make his murders more niurdcrnti hi desperadoes more desperate his embroglios more embroiled and his moving accidents by flood and field more moving more unexpected and more impossible to all such series however there is a necessary term  the spring on which they are destined to act loses its elasticity and exaggeration defeats its own end nor is this term placed at any very remote distance others therefore abandoning the substance seek only to exaggerate the forms and throw themselves for ellect on the production of some absurd novelty of style such are the germanisms of recent introduction quaintnesses or a gorgeousness and a stilted elevation of expression which is neither prose nor verse but a condensed essence of the defects of both forcibly feeble and pompously inane and these affectations arc brought to bear upon worncut and cllote themes as the tinselled trappings of a theatrical wardrobe are sometimes employed to conceal thc mean and distorted figure of a wouldbe stage adonis others again place their hopes of success upon

of their relative excellencies must depend on the value ol the specific nature they have been employed to copy just as may be observed in thc comparison ol the dutch and italian masters hut one d the

that access ol hypocrisy now more frequently adopted to hide hom society as far as possible all deviations hum though prescribed standard that more rigorous reign of the decencies of life and the growing timidity in authors in their dibits to reproduce the realities which heave and glow beneath these studied appearances the concurrence of all these various influences has occasioned the

society  and a pole of cynicism to which the seekers after the intense gravitate in their dibit to excite emotion by the representation ol the exceptional the violent and all that society rejects from

faithfulness though right note is struck from the first when fletchor christian who anon becomes though mutineer is introduced in loving converse with mallina his tahitian sweetheart for the paradisiacal life though sailors of the bounty had led in tahiti for months was a strongor temptation to mutiny than the tyranny of their commander lieutenant bligh hore is the first appoarance of

ship lu her right hand was an open claspknife she leaned hor back against though tree and gazod steadily at the bounty for nearly a minute then with an angry exclamation cast the knife from hor into

all was well as ho peered over the low bows of the vessel  his sailors eyo saw that all the strands of the cable but one were parted   and walking aft he knocked at the door of the stateroom occupied by lieutenant william bligh     though cable is nearly chafed through sir or the strands have parted there was a strong squall just before daylight and the ship strained very heavily upon it i think  keep your opinions to yourself you are a dd careless fellow and not fit even to keep anchor watch where is it chafed   about a fathom below the water sir answered the young man     bah said the commander with a contemptuous laugh and you have the audacity to attempt to screen your carelessness by telling me it has chafeda couple of fathoms down for the hawsepipe and in fifteen fathoms of water the fact is some of the natives have been off in a canoe and have cut it under your nose    were you asleep on your watch mr young  answer me quickly  such was the irascible and tyrannous commander who conspired unconsciously with the young women of tahiti to provoke the mutiny on though bounty and to produce the extraordinary community on pitcairn island the story ends with the death of christian a comparison between him and bunyans hero would be a fruitful theme and last touch of all with the discovery of the pitcairn islanders granted that though sordid lawless tale should have

pitcairn island tales of adventure by louis becke and walter jeffery fisher unwin  probably there never ha3 been a narrative richer in romantic scenes than this account of the mutiny of the bounty and the experiences of capt bligh and of his comrades cut adrift in the middle of the pacific ocean the subsequent career of his wouldbe murderers constitutes an episode of crime seldom equalled and never surpassed but we do not remember that they have ever been the subject of a romance either in prose or verse except in byrons poem of the island our authors are already favourably known for their tales of adventure in the pacific islands the inhabitants of which have been thoroughly studied by them  they have dealt with their ample materials skilfully dwelling with much severity on capt blighs tyranny which caused not only this mutiny but also an outbreak in new south wales from which colony he was unceremoniously shipped and sent home his heroism and fortitude in safely navigating an open boat for a distance of 1400 miles proved that he must have possessed sterling merit it is however with the subsequent action of the mutineers that the reader is chiefly concerned the story of the loves of the sailors and the women of tahiti  white men and brown womenwho accompanied them to pitcairn island may be somewhat erotic but probably it is characteristic of this unusual form of courtship the narrative of the crimes which followed is of course more or less fanciful murder followed murder until only one of the original crew of the bounty survived all these are sensationally recounted the strangest point of the story and this is trueis that the survivor adams instead of being brutalised by his surroundings developed into an earnest christian and educated the hybrid offspring of these unions with a success which scarcely corroborates the usual view of the incorrigible depravity of humanity their primitive innocent simplicity the total absence of immorality and their genuine good nature have been the marvel of the few who have visited that lovely isle to this part of their subject our authors have done but scant justice although they have alluded to it and yet they might have added a most interesting chapter to their romance the reader of the gold finder by george griffith white  co will be surprised by the contrast between the commencement and the conclusion of the story it opens with a murder a felony or two and an  accursed bloodlegacy all leading up to the conventional hunt for the treasure of a wrecked spanish galleon of bygone days the real purport of the story becomes evident about halfway through the book lt contains the adventures of a modern pirate equipped with steam dynamite cartridges and the most approved instruments of modern warfare not satisfied with this the author causes certain parties to fit out a piratecatcher of equally perfect design and equipment and the story finishes with a bloody fight in which the villains are destroyed it reads like the history of a latterday alabama and so far as the narrative is concerned it constitutes a very readable volume of adventure and seafighting the little goldmagnet which points with the greatest nicety to though nearest piece of the precious metal plays a very subsidiary part in this volume the author evidently thinks that it is capable of better things in a literary sense for he concludes with the assurance that the magnet wrought wonders in the hands of its new and lawful possessors and that of these wonders  there will be more to tell

B1210,"['8859985', '6736823']",  the mutable many new novels by robert barr methuen  co mr barrs latest novel though it is of considerable length can be read throughout with little cessation of interest much pains has been bestowed on it an effort is made to avoid the elaboration of the obvious and commonplace incidents of the story and it is difficult to describe any portion of the book as being below the average level of the whole in form it consists of an account of the affairs of a large factory in london with the inevitable strikes and contests between the manager of the concern and the workpeople the managers only daughter is the heroine who is it must be confessed a somewhat conventional type of the young lady of the day but she is the only one of the dramatis persona to whom the epithet can be applied the workmen and their leaders are all carefully studied characters and they are well presented to the reader the novel rarely approaches to anything that is very great in art though there are indications that the writer is capable of very successful efforts it is pleasant to notice that the novel is devoid of the element of padding which so frequently marks the fiction of the time especially where the author is under a contract to write so many thousand words by a particular date and it would be hard to point to any portion of mr barrs  the mutable many which is slipshod or hasty in composition with regard to the class of roaders who are likely to be attracted by the volume it may be said that the book is as well suited to the drawingroom as it is to the club table the socalled art critic of the day will hardly appreciate the uses to which mr bar puts him with a view to  booming an incapable and ignorant painter into notoriety and eventually into success  new novels the mutable any byrobert barr methuen  co mr bar writes this time in all seriousness but he comes perilously near the brink of caricature the success of marcella and of sir george teeaady

fairly claim that the politicians should be living and not lay figures now mr barrs strikers come straight from the property room you have the clever artisan with the managership of the works in his eye the burly yorkshireman with lusty sinews and thick brains the glib union secretary and the  mutable many  themselves the veering mob of workmen for the real human being drawn with knowledge and sympathy you look in vain for sentimental interest mr bar gives you the managers beautiful daughter edna in love with the aspiring artisan aforesaid comicone might say farcical relief is provided by a pseudoartist a son of one of the masters he is caricature pure and simple wallowing in money varnished with humbug and a cad at heart he sets up a studio in chelsea with stone steps like those at the pitti palace and a flunkey in a blue crimson and silver livery of the artists own design nothing gives character and dignity to a place so much as a  man sumptuously fitted out in a style that is palpably regardless of cost and if it may be plainly seen that the man performs no needful function whatever then is the effect heightened for few human beings attain the apex of utter uselessness the great hotels of this country recognise the distinction reflected upon them by the possession of a creature of splendour at their doors who grandly wafts the incoming guests with a handwave towards the hall but these persons of embellishment often demean themselves by opening the doors of cabs and performing other useful acts thus detracting from their proper function which was barney insisted to

on what the ladies call a cottage bonnet and her morning dress being very simple and her hair somewhat out of order with riding as well as a wornout pair of gloves being on her taper fumers the

pretending as much confusion as she could kitty appeared to draw bink while the officer jumped forward and caught her in his arms it was foreign to charlottes feelings to resist  harmless a salute she therefore allowed him to profit hy his opportunity half shutting her eyelids while the blood suffused her beautiful countenance and quietly drawing off the glove from her right hand she watched her moment when the officer having finished his devoirs was engaged in once more placing her safely on the ground quickly swinging her little arni lound she gave him a slap on his unprotected cheek that awoke every echo among the surrounding trees  then bursting into a loud laugh she scampered back at full speed through tue path by which she hud come the young officer no sooner felt this retaliation

the chase again but at no moment was he in any anger of lobing the scent j for the incident had so tickled chattys fancy that she literally screamed with laughter that pealed through the woods on every side and invited the officer to overtake his prize as the fit increased on her it impeded her running once or twice she was very nearly falling and he now came rapidly up with her when a turning in the road hid her from his sight putting forth his speed he bounced round the projecting point what was his surprise to find himself in the midst of five or six men cutting the evergreens while the fair object of his pursuit was hanging breathless with her merriment round the neck of a tall man  the latter had his back turned towards the pursuer and was dressed in a blue greatcoat and round glazed hat hearing the sudden noise behind him he turned towards the officer who was hesitating what to do  the latter no sooner saw his fine manly coun tenanee than he started back in amazement muttering  confound it the port admiral by jupiter   and the foolery thus concludes  the joke was then explained to the old officer who having shaken his sides at the same and given his directions to the parkkeeper proceeded to conduct his illustrious guest to the house charlotte now leaning on his arm was internally delighted at the idea  however accidentallyof having laid her fingers on the cheek of collateral and he as a gallant and proper officer holding with frederick the great that no dishonour could come from the hand of a lady who was at once of great beauty and honourable birth nay truth to say i doubt not that he would have been very glad to win the same favours from many a proud beauty in the land even though it were at the same costat least ive known many who would and i can answer for myselfthough to be sure  a most material point as   would say i boast of no ry1 blood in my veins save such as may have filtered down and muddied in its descent for the last couple of hundred years since the good old days of queen mess  when my evertobevenerated ancestor the celebrated king the port admiral an open warmhearted and noble character is nevertheless a smuggler which disgraceful fact is discovered by a lord ol the admiralty on a visit of inspection to the port  and the following degrading story is attached to it  von may call it  moonshine if you like sir hilliard said the latter  but i fear if these facts come to the knowledge of his majestys ministers it will be denominated smuggling a breach of our lawsand treated its such  particularly in one whose rank would warrant us n expecting him to prove a good example to his inferiors i should really be very sorry to be instrumental in bringing about any inquiry that might hurt one i value so much as sir richard salisbury if you could point out any path by which 1 could escape hiving this serious information before lord but you see by suppressing it i might inculpate myself   well well sir you shant do that on my account sid the hearty sir liichard  for my part ye see i look upon it that the service pays us cursed badly and these lillie affairs are the mere opportunities of office a poor fellow by love may starve on an admirals pay if he has a family iicidcs i shouldnt like to bc popping off the hooks some day and j leaving chatty and margiee without a shot in  their locker moreover aller all its a mere dil j terence ol opinion they think smuggling a bad i thing but as for me why oddsbobbs  i think i its a very good thing doesnt it j should  like to know form a nursery for the navy

superscribed for himself he opened it within was a bill drawn on a certain house in london for live hundred pounds the amount of his share for  moonshine received the bill only required his signature

the reader will be carried on by too strong an interest to have time to pause for criticism when the book is closed and ho has time to consider he may perhaps object to some of the details but the fact will remain that the novel is one of sterling interest it is well put together and the mystery is very cleverly kept up the reader is just sufficiently taken into the confidence of the author to be able to feel a strong sympathy with though personages concerned whilst at the same time there is sufficient concealment to stimulate curiosity and on the whole the dcnomcnt is adequate to though preparation  we say on the whole because the final iii seo very of the cause of mark wylders mysterious disappearance is not sufficiently marked our readers would scarcely thank us to tell them the whole story but we will keep the authors secret ind give the outline of the tale the scene is laid in a line old manorial countryhouse in a midland county the scenes are all well described the short preliminary sketch of the two families the wylders and the brandons is an excellent introduction to a dark and shadowy story there were wylders of brandon and brandons of brandon in one generation a wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the brandons the next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto the estates were back again with the wylders a statement of title is usually a dry affair but that of the dynasty of brandon hall was a truculent romance this strong bad handsome halfinsane halfdiabolical race who must have descended in aright line from cain or the corsair are represented at the period when the story begins by dorcas brandon the proud beautiful apathetic heiress of the manorhouse who seems to suffer for the sins of her forefathers rather than to partake of their evil nature there is a complicated coubinship of all the chief parties the wylders whose estates join those of brandon and whose people were every bit os wicked are about to be joined together in matrimonythe estates and the owners mark wylder a rough dark evilomened seacaptain who does not belie his blood having just succeeded to the wylder estates is on the point of marriage with his cousin dorcas he would greatly prefer his poor cousin rachel lake who lives in a lonely picturesque farmhouse called redmans dell whilst dorcas prefersbut that is one of thc secrets

which ought to have brought him to the gallows if it had not made his fortune he tyrannises over his sister who is the only character quite free from the evil taint that runs in the three families she is however a victim to it there is some secret of rascality between stanley lake and mark wyldera secret which apparently makes mark dread his cousin as well as detest him they go out together one night though week before the marriage and mark wylder never returns letters are received from him speaking mysteriously of his affairs and of some old scrape the consequences of which have obliged him to go suddenly abroad he sets his betrothed bride free from her engagement and letters on business continue to be received written by him from different continental towns giving directions about his property and speaking of his return the lawyer to whom his letters are chiefly addressed has a great deal to do in the story but his part is far too longall his chicaneries and attempts to overreach poor william wylder marks brother are wearisome and occupy the space needed for the dinohment some time after the departure of mark wylder dorcas brandon marries stanley lake the reader has been prepared for this exchangetho reader knows what a scoundrel he is without heart or conscience but dorcas brandon does not know it she is infatuated about him had determined to renounce her engagement to mark if mark himself had not saved her the trouble but stanley lake has difficulties and mysteries of his own in which he has involved his sister rachel and a dark terrible mystery gathers over the whole house of brandon there aro some touches of imagination which though they have nothing absolutely to do with the story heighten the interest and are extremely effective tamar the old nurse and though spectral figure of uncle lorn are powerful sketches though descriptions of places too are so well managed that rocks trees pathways ami even the very furniture of certain rooms add to the weird ghostly awe inspired by the dark nameless crime that haunts the story gradually gathering distinctness and becoming palpable until in the end it stands revealed and confessed as we have said the dinohmcnt is not sufficiently worked out but it has substance enough to justify though preparation mr le fanu shows qualities that ought to enable him to write even better novels than the present his style is forcible and brilliant and his faculty for graphic description sometimes leads him to bestow too much time and minute delineation on secondary characters lawyer larkins and his rascalities

with him lost how much of the romance and the colour of life  but it was hardly by seeking it that morris lit upon the well it was by the workings of the natural instincts within him no child that in its halfconscious gambols always finds and never seeks ever came more easily more instinctively upon the beautiful things that could please its eyes than william morris came upon the waters of the fountain of youth nay it seemed as though the well at the worlds end was brought to him no need to travel except in imagination across the  wood perilous and the  thirsty desert in quest of the fountain of youth if the well at the worlds end comes bubbling up at your very feet as you design your wallpapers at queens square or hammersmith or superintend your tapestrylooms at merton or examine your upholsteries in oxford street or write your poems wherever and whensoever you can find halfanhours breathing space from a score of different kinds of the work that is your only sport this is why morriss position among the poets of the world is unique he though a poet stands for all time as the very type of youth though a poet we say  for as a rule few people age more quickly than does your poet and no wonder for like the nightingale of the romanies the more he is pricked by the thorn on which it is his fate to sit the louder and the longer does he sing shakespeare lamented the forty winters that had besieged his brow coleridge called himself old at the same age byron was old at thirty but no other poet of whom we have any record was ever at any period of his life so young that he could have written this story compare morriss delight in the beauty of the earth in the birds of the wildwood with that of any other poets delight in these things  compare the talk of the lovers beneath though trees in this story with anything to be found in any of the poems of such venerable bards as chatterton shelley and keats if morris at sixty had not reached the mature age when he could have written thus  there was a listening fear in her regard as if calamity had but begun  as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up assuredly at twentyfour keats was too old to have been able to write as morris writes in this volume of the beauty of earth and the joy of life what was called the  melancholy tone of the earthly paradise was but the expression of his regret that even the waters from the well at the worlds end were not powerful enough to enable the drinker to enjoy for ever the beauty of earth and the witchery of woman matthew arnold in a noble prosaic line which is often called poetical says of sophocles that he saw life steadily and saw it whole this steadiness and wholeness of vision is the very opposite of the youthful way of seeing fife it is in brilliant little pictures coloured with beauty that youth sees the world and it is thus that morris always saw it indeed there is not a weakness in his work and not a beauty which does not spring from that ebullience of youth which he drank and was always drinking from the well at the worlds end when keats wrote beauty is truth truth beauty  that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know the words did not really comprise his philosophy of life as a score of passages in his letters will show but of morriss law of life these lines are a full expression upon this axiom that  beauty is truth truth beauty his social theories no less than his artistic were based that generous heart of his became after middle age deeply touched with pity for the peopletouched because he saw how cruelly the folk were shut out from the palace beautiful which nature intended them to enjoy and he ran his head against the closed gates of the palace though to him they had been thrown wide open and beat them with his hands and cried let the folk in  any and arriet and all whether his preachings from the socialistic tub of hammersmith broadway did good or illwhether they opened the eyes of the eastend to the iniquities of the middleclass patrons of tottenham court eoad chairs tables and wallpapers as some think they did or merely turned goodhumoured vulgarians into sour morose and insolent ones as others affirmis a question altogether beyond our scope here the nobility and the beauty of his intentions and his aspirations none has ever challenged and every word he uttered was that of a generoushearted youth who saw life not steadily and whole but unsteadily and partially and in little pictures the artistic selfindulgence the self  pleasing whimwhich is the characteristic of youth is the basis of all morriss work as poet as artist and as doctrinaire though with the full conviction that if the world did not join him in his tastes it was so much the worse for the world he worked always to please himself most other poets after youth is gone arrange a compromise a modus vivendi between themselves and the taste of the time  a man must needs be more like the age in which he lives than he is like his father and mother says the chinese sage it is youth that knows not the word compromise nor did morris know that word whatsoever work pleased himself he did and if the public liked it so much the better for the public at one time when browning was his hero iu poetry it gave him pleasure to write rugged and more or less obscure dramatic idyls these he produced heedless as to whether he would or would not please anybody but himself and his friends afterwards he found a new pleasure in writing in the very opposite style to that of his first volume long narrative poems in smooth chaucerian measures but without securing chaucers nearness of atmosphere the public might or might not care for such a return to old forms that was their matter after this having become fascinated by the northern sagas he found a still newer pleasure in writing a kind of prose poetry bristling with archaic locutions and archaic words taking no heed of newspaper gibes about  wardour street english c he continued to write them till death stayed his hand the step from this fancy of writing in obsolete euglish to printing books in an obsolete type was not a wide one and soon no printing gave him pleasure that was not either in blackletter or in some type akin to blackletter at the root of all his beautiful work in a word there lies the whim of pleasing himself which is the chief characteristic of youthof extreme youth whether this selfindulgence will or will not prevent his work from being accepted as it would otherwise have been by posterity is one of the questions which time alone can answer black  letter we know can never be revived man has already awakened to the fact that wonderful as have been the few thousand years of his past his future of a million years is going to be more wonderful still posterity will be far more likely to favour some kind of phonetic symbol that saves time than the type which morris loved and what about the archaic diction and locutions in which he delighted  beautiful to our minds at least as is this  wardour street english it is after all an artifice and as such does not strengthen but weakens the full illusion which the worker in imaginative prose is supposed to seek the moment that in any imaginative picture artifice is obtruded where even art is weak unless she disguises herself illusion which must be always born of the artists sincerity begins to grow dim had the verbal texture of these stories not been imitated from books but been the natural and inevitable expression of the writers mood the combined beauties of the old literary temper and the new of which the stories are so full would have made them surpass in charm most other things in imaginative literature but not even the movement of morriss splendid imagination can prevent us from feeling as we read that the raconteur is a modern man whose natural speech is modern english and who is indulging here the selfpleasing whim of a marvellous boy the truth seems to be as the present writer more than once remarked to morris that if he really wished to throw around the reader the veil of full illusion which most imaginative artists in prose endeavour te throw around him he should have written these stories not in the epic but in the autobiographic form then the archaisms that are interspersed in the narrative would not have seemed to the reader more artificial and therefore more insincere than those in the dialogue of scotts novels the accent though strange would have appeared the natural accent of a dramatic character this is easily seen if we contrast the beautiful realism of the dialogue between the characters who live in the story before us with the movement trammelled if fascinating of the narrative portions surrounding them here is an example of an admirable dialogue between the hero and bull shockhead one of the wandering baud of brigands who judging from their use of the patterin would seem to be gipsies  early next morning ralph arose and called bull shockhead to him and said   so it is bull that thou art my wartaken thrall bull nodded his head but frowned therewithal said ralph   if i bid thee aught that is not beyond reason thou wilt do it wilt thou not  yea said bull surlily  well quoth ralph  i am going a journey eastaway and i may not have thee with me therefore i bid thee take this gold and go free with my goodwill bulls face lighted up and the eyes glittered in his face  but he said   yea kings son but why wilt thou not take me with thee  said ralph  it is a perilous journey and thy being with me will cast thee into peril and make mine more moreover i have an errand as thou wottest which is all mine own bull pondered a little and then said   kings son i was thinking at first that our errands lay together and it is so but belike thou sayest true that there will be less peril to each of us if we sunder at this time but now i will say this to thee that henceforth thou shalt be as a brother to me if thou wilt have it so and if ever thou comest amongst our people thou wilt be in no danger of them nay they shall do all the good they may to thee then he took him by the hand and kissed him and he set his hand to his gear and drew forth a little purse of some small beasts skin that was broidered in front with a pair of bulls horns  then he stooped down and plucked a long and tough bent from the grass at his feet for they were talking in the garden of the hostel and twisted it swiftly into a strange knot of many plies and opening the purse laid it therein and said  kings son this is the token whereby it shall be known amongst our folk that i have made thee my brother  were the flames roaring about thee or the swords clashing over thine head if thou cry out i am the brother of bull shockhead all those of my kindred who are near will be thy friends and thy helpers and now i say to thee farewell but it is not altogether unlike that thou mayest hear of me again in the furthest east  but then comes the question what kind of illusion did morris really seek in these storiesstories which notwithstanding a certain affinity with the methods of the sagamen must be characterised as a new form of imaginative art in judging of the success or nonsuccess of anything in imaginative literature the first question to ask and the first to answer is this what is the nature of the imaginative belief that the writer asks of the reader does he endeavour to compass the full illusion which is effected by the modern novel or only that partial illusion which the poet seeks  while nearness is the quest of the worker in prose fiction remoteness may be and often is the legitimate quest of the poet these stories are in atmosphere far more remote than the  canterbury tales chaucers quest was nearness of suggestion and this is what makes him so much more modern than a prosewriter like malory so much more modern than a poet like spenser even when morris modelled his work in some measure upon chaucers he never achieved chaucers nearness of atmosphere  perhaps he never tried to do so it would almost seem that in order to find a substitute for that aid which metre can give to the poet whose object is to produce a sense of remoteness morris in these stories goes out of his way to surround the dramatic action with all kinds of improbabilities when shakespeare introduced lions into the forest of arden it was not done in order to produce remoteness for the acted drama of the modern world whether written in verse or prose is unlike the acted drama of greece in this that it takes a place between prose fiction whose quest is full illusion and unadulterated poetry whose quest is partial illusion shakespeare introduced his lions because the audience of his time would scarcely have felt that a forest in foreign lands would be complete without them but why does morris introduce lions and apparently the entire fauna of africa into european forests unless it is to secure remoteness and so give a reason for the archaic nature of his form if however it was morriss desire as we are suggesting to achieve the partial illusion of poetry another question arises in connexion with the well at the worlds end is there any proper length for a narrative  and if so what is it although very much longer than  the roots of the mountains  the well at the worlds end is entirely without the grand pathetic motive of that story after the assassination of the heros first mistress the lady of the castle of abundance when it has become evident what the peripeteia is going to be the story becomes a mere string of incidents which could have been shortened at almost any point and here one of the most noticeable of all morriss artistic gifts his fecundity of invention of incident leads him astray in judging of the proper length of any work in imaginative literature it seems necessary to illustrate our meaning by examples taken from the two opposite kinds of prose fiction two of the greatest masterpieces in the prose fiction of the nineteenth century are very likely vanity fair on the one hand and  undine on the other long as is  vanity fair it is not by a single sentence too long and short as is undine it is not by a single sentence too short with regard to vanity fair so complete has been the illusion achieved by the writer so entirely has the reader accepted the characters as real that he reads the last lines with a feeling of regret that they are the last he wants to follow still further the adventures of that wonderful becky sharp round whom the other characters cluster and in the same way short as is undine the reader feels on reading the last lines that to have said more would have tended to weaken rather than to strengthen the readers imaginative belief now in the story before us morriss method is as entirely that of poetry of the remote kind as in the stories of  the earthly paradise he seems as we have said to go out of his way to show that his quest is the partial illusion which the poet alone is except in the case of chaucer expected to secure and yet after having taken all this trouble to make the reader feel that he is in fairyland morris spins out his story into a poem as long as a realistic novel of modern life he seems to forget that howsoever lovely a fairy story may be human life is much too short for readers to want to read it at such length as this a mere string of adventures such as these would have had far more effect had they been told at a third of the length that nothing can possibly be simpler than the main thread of the story we can show in a few words rumours of the well at the worlds end and stories concerning the many people who have perished in trying to find it and of the few who have drunk of its waters reached ralph the younger son of king peter of upmeads and fired him with the wish to drink of it and one day he stole away from his father and mother in quest of the well scarcely had he left home when chance or providence or fate threw him across a maiden of the yeoman class ursula who also had a desire to seek the well this maiden attracted ralph and no wonder for she was as fascinating as any of the women to be found in any of mr morriss poems   and she went hither and thither about the hall and into the buttery and back putting away the victual and vessels from the board and making as if she heeded him not and ralph looked on her and deemed that each way she moved was better than the last so shapely of fashion she was  and again he bethought him of the evensong of the high house at upmeads and how it befitted her  for she went barefoot after the manner of maidens who work afield and her feet were tanned with the sun of hay harvest but as shapely as might be  but she was clad goodly withal in a green gown wrought with flowers but if ursula made an impression upon ralph he made upon her a deeper impression still for although she felt her passion for him to be hopeless she straightway abandoned the lover she then had in order to find the well at the worlds end and so become worthy of ralph for the waters of this well have the power of transfiguring the drinker both body and soul and give him the power of dominating over mankind by force of wisdom as well as youth and beauty after leaving ursula ralph remembered for a time her charms but he passed through many adventures and at length encountered a siren who completely drove out of his mind all memory of ursula this was the famous lady of the castle of abundance one of the few who had found the well at the worlds end and drunk of it and become in consequence irresistible to all human kind of the male sex but extremely disliked by the female in ralph however she encountered her match for if she conquered the men through the magical power she had imbibed at the well he conquered all the women through his natural endowments of beauty strength and chivalry and especially by his freedom from any desire to conquer them and these two lived together as lovers in the wild  wood and she undertook to conduct him to the well the descriptions of their life during this period are extremely beautiful their bliss however soon came to an end for one day after ralph had left her to shoot deer for their dinner the husband and tyrant from whom she had fled found her and slew her notwithstanding his grief ralph after a while pursued his quest of the well and now that the siren was dead his thoughts would again recur to ursula who as was pretty broadly indicated during his travels was on the same road as himself and was very likely to cross his path as in fact she does after many adventures and escapes from many perils they reached the well at the worlds end and drank the waters ending their days as king and queen of upmeads but whether or not these beautiful stories are apt sometimes to become overlong the reader will say would that the beloved storyteller were with us still to tell new storiestell them by the score nay by the hundred if it pleased him to do so would that william morris

B6812,"['6673337', '3203165']",  literature the works of edgar allan poe edited by john h ingram vols i and ii containing the collected tales london and edinburgh adam  charles black 1874 with jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although mr ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume i do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if i were just a little more mad than ever i waswe can say frankly this is what i am there is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  ligeiaas tothe expression of ligcias eyes he tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj though glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not

B3242,"['4691240', '8878079']",  highways and byways third series 3 vols12mo 1827 there is a large class of writers of imagination as they are called who are the most complete matteroffact people in the world and who manage to deceive themselves and others respecting the bent of their intellect so grossly as they do by the mere substitution of novel titles to their books instead of calling them openly and honestly by the only tianie to which they can fairly assert a rightnamely journals among this class however are to be found some few individuals who notwithstanding that the predominant qualities of their genius are essentially of the newspaper kind possess not only those qualities in a very transcendent degree but many of the noblest properties of the human mind more abundantly than the generality of men the writer of highways and byways is a brilliant sample of his tribe whose general aim it is to throw a dash of the romantic as an auxiliary and embellishment into the narrative but to whom the task of constructing a story wholly rooted in fiction and relying upon the creative soul alone would be like that of the poor israelitesto make bricks without straw he possesses uevertheless very powerful claims upon our admiration on many accounts his descriptions of scenery are occasionally magnificent and imbued with the fervid delight which travellers may well feel in gazing on the splendid operations of nature his language is at once correct striking felicitouspossessing an uncommon union of vigour and fulness and sometimes a few sentences and now and then a whole

constitutionalists were collecting their forces in the same vicinity and enlivened the scene by frequent skirmishes with the supporters of the faith our englishman not liking exactly the promiseuous company of his hostelry at gedro and his appetite for the romantic being awakened by hearing that the neighbourhood of the adjoining valley of heas or rather the eminences that rise around it thronged with the huts of the cagot race from whom the rest of the world shrank away as from contagionit comes into his english and heterodox head that he would even take up his abode for a while among these loathed and degraded beings for the sake of studying their characterexpecting of course to find them angels in disguise these cagots of the pyrenees we must remind our readers are precisely the cretins of the valais and the cahets of guienne and gascony and bearne and generally of the marshy lands of the west of france the cagots of whom we are now speaking exist in some of the gorges of the pyrenees in frightful numbers tihey are goitred diseased and stunted imbecile mentally and bodily and lying under inexorable and iron disabilities arising from the prejudices of their fellowcreatures even war whose necessities break through so many prejudices had not rendered the dwellings of these children of misery less objects of aversion and disgust or mitigated the caution with which they were universally shunned our hero is therefore very happily furnished with an opportunity delightful to john bull of ascertaining and proving by personal inspection that an intercourse with the cagot worthies would not only be very tolerable but absolutely a thing to be desired by all parties and although the rest of the world for ages had instinctively agreed upon the propriety of leaving them to

perfection that might invite a sculptors hand and make his heart thrill as le gazed i hastily threw her cloak and hood over this rich field of beauty which i felt to be already violated by the rude yet admiring stare of the astonished observers  highways and byeways or tales of thc roadside picked vp in the french provinces by a walking gentleman  this is an eloquent effort at storytelling but

paulo r jmora canamfwus  mr reades novel with the quaiit anl proverbial title it is never too late to mf d is not only the best novel which we hlive read this season but also one of the very few firstrate works of fiction which we have met wvith in our life generally speaking we do not like those novels which are written at a system tile bias is too predominant the purpose is too glaring throughout every part of the tale and prejudice too commonly occupies the place which 8hould be consecrated to the imagination these drawbacks generally take front party or more properly principlenovels all that charm of nature without which the web of fiction becomes lull and uninteresting but this is not so with mr reades novel it is a principlenovel it is aimed against a system and that system one of the most crying evils which afflict mankind and disgrace humanity it attacks that code of discipline which converts error into crime crime into madnesswhich makes pickpockets buriglars and burglars murdererswhich under the pretence of philanthropy inflicts tortures beside which the most cruel refinements of the inquisition ere as gentle mercieswhichi treats the criminal as a machine to be systematised and not as a soul to be saved it is levelled at the solitary separate and silent systemn of treating criminals it is evident that the atrocities committed at birminghalm gaol have supplied mr read with the text for his sermon the htorrible revelations which resulted from tile inquiry made into time discipline of that inferno are closely copied throughoutand inleed they i neededl no exaggeration to reach the higlest possible limit of horror they are copied we say incident by incident the re fined cruelties of the crank labour faisely weighted and taxing human nature beyond all powers of endurance in its fatiguing and monotonous work the cruel tortures of the punishment jacket an instrument which corn bined the iron collar and the scavengers daughter  of the old torturers the water dashes over the poor fainting wretch the salt cramnied down his parched and burning throat by hand fuls the dark cells which drive the stoutest iuiad the degrading whip the food cut down to starvation point and lastly the mental and bodily torture by all these horrible means so accumulated and aggravated that poor weak ignorant human nature sees and finds no other escape from its tortures but suicideall these things are related by mir read as taking place in  gaol under the reign of governor hlawes and his familiars just as credible witnesses proved upon oath before a commission that they took place in birmingham gaol under lieut austin and his myrmidons all this however is but ar episode upon the main story this is based upon the loves of a stout berkshire farmer george fielding and his beautiful cousin susan merton john meadows a prosperous and influential yeoman also loves susan andl has resolved to marry her at any cost under the cloak of respectabi litv this fellow hides as black and knavish a heart as ever throbbed in the bosom of the most hardened criminal he is the perfection of a deep vulgar hardheaded scheming fellow no knavery is too great f8r him provided lhe can only keep his respectability for this purpose hie seldom acts directly himself but employs some base tool to work out his schemes fielding is so hampered by the intrigues of this fellow that lie emigrates to australia bearing with him a promise from old farmer tmerton that if ever he returns with a thousand pounds lie shall marry his daughter meadows schemes to turn the girls heartproceeds with the cunning of an lago supseradded to the method of a man of business of the nineteenth century the scene changes to australia fielding is joined by tom robinson a reclaimed convict gold is discovurel life in the diggins glows upon the canvas with all the truthfulness of nature after various success true love is victorious fielding who wins not one thousand pounds but four returns to imarry his susan meandows is baffled just w hen his hopes for the consummation of his wishes are at their highest and the drama ends as all such irainas should happily for those for whom the sympathies of the reader have been enlisted froin the beginning to the end the gaol scenes are introduced as incidental to the career of tom robinson who is one of the minor heroes of the tale of these we have nlready spoken they are drawn with marvellous fidelity and fascinate the reader with a horrible interest which renders it impossible to lay down the volunie until it is concluded the dry bones of the birmingham gaul rleport are here vivified into a terrible reality and our sympathies are perpetually awakened as we perceive the truthfulness of the heartrending narrative the gaol scenes too give occasion for the introduction of a character which we without hesitation pronounce to be one of the very best in the whole range of fiction this is the chaplain of the gaol mr eden a man such as there are we fear but few in existencea man whom if he lived would be one of those chosen few whom the almighty sends upon the earth to soften the lot of poor erring miserable sinnersone indeed of those very few who constitute as it were the salt of the human species it will be almost invariably found that where the novelist introduces a clergyman upon the scene he falls into citherone or other of twoerrorseither he represents him in an unfavourable light as a canting worldlyminded hypocrite whose practises are the very reverse of his professions or else lie makes a saint of him without one single feature of humanity in hinm from theqiloria round his head down to the soles of his martyred feet now mr eden is a mana man of like passions with us alla man who feels for another and sympathises with his weakness because he knows how weak his own heart is there is a vitality a reality about this man which is surprising isle is as good as gold but when we have surveyed his character we do not fold our hands and say complacently that he is an impossibility but our hearts beat with high hopes and we ejaculate ohm that there were more like him  ve fear however that there are so few men like mr i eden that he himself is but the creation of the authors fancy the pendant character of mr lepel who is intended by way of contrast to represent the systematising so muelhpercent ctass of chaplains is probably a portrait for lie is introduced as  chaplain to one of thle northern anols and we fancy we can detect the original from whichl he was drawn the other characters in the novel are sketched with great power and fidelity george fielding and susan merton the central figures in the picture are charming i their contrast  he a manly real rustic she a sinple loving maiden john meadows is also a welldrawn ciaracter the incarnation of selfreliance and trust in money unbalanced by anyhing like a conscience or real principle a perfect contrast to this admirable work is suitshiine and sliadow by the anonymous author of  mtabelanytlhing more vapid more pointlessand more unnatural than this composition it would be difficult to conceive we suppose that it is intended to belong to that class of fictions which are termned faslionable novels of which carlyle has said that they of all the other productions of literature miost nearly approach absolute fatuity the characters are fashioned like dolls gaudily dressed up in the odds and ends of o0d frippery and they move about with thle painful elaboration of automata yet this is nothing but wrhat we expected when upon opening the book our eye was greeted with such itames as fitzosborne captain trelawny and lady lora vivyan the lay for this style of novel is certainly overpast and we had entertained a hope that the species was nearly if not quite extinct adelaide qieen of italy like mr reades book is a principlenovel lmut it must be confessed that that is its only point of comparison with that admirable production it is dedicated to the archduchess sophia of russia and is intended to support the principles of the concordat lately concluded between the pope and the emperor of austria  it attacks the memory of those who attempted to curb the power of the papacy and wrested from the hands of the holy father that temporal sovereignty which as mr mac cabe thinks he righteously possessed mr mac cabe has of course the worst possible opinion of those who attemlt to effect the liberation of italy whose efforts lie speaks of as tending  to fill italy with confusion war and

B4437,['8794124'],  the english novel in the time of shakespeare tty j j jusserand translated from the french by elizabeth lee fisher unwin m jusseraxds little monograph on the english novel originally published in french some five years ago showed how much he could teach us about our own literature his researches are now presented to us in a revised and enlarged shape and the result is a contribution of permanent value to the history of elizabethan literature m jusserand has chosen ground that we ourselves have neglected but his explorations have not been superficial and we are inclined to think that future travellers in the same country will find little new information to supply and few erroneous impressions to correct with thoroughness as an investigator m jusserand combines a faculty of placing his results attractively before his readers and he has been fortunate in securing the assistance of miss elizabeth lee who has done her work of translation satisfactorily throughout miss lees english is always accurate and when it suggests a french idiom we appreciate the scholarly flavour of the rendering the book abounds in pertinent illustrations william rogerss faithful engraving of queen elizabeths portrait forms the frontispiece a view of burghley house exemplifies the richness of elizabethan architecture with which contemporary literature had much in common portraits of sir philip sidney and his sister wellselected plates from such works of imagination as topsoils  fourfooted beastes and  serpents examples of the illustrations employed in french seventeenth century romances all give a charm to the volume which the scholar will appreciate no less than the general reader the useful index deserves a word of praise m jusserand traces the sources of the novel even before the remote date of beowulf but he wisely avoids merely archaeological speculation and begins a detailed treatment of his subject with sir thomas malorys  morte darthur as everybody is aware caxton was the printer of this noble and joyous book but it is less generally known that this was only one of caxtons efforts as printer editor or translator to gratify his patrons insatiable taste for works of fiction the new forms of literature and the new lines of thought which the renaissance introduced seemed to stimulate rather than to check the demand for chivalric romances which had grown steadily through the middle ages as we watch in m jusserands pages the development of the novel from caxtons translations through lord bernerss unwieldy romances to the works of fiction produced by shakespeares contemporaries lyly and greene we are deeply impressed by the permanence of mediaeval influences the early elizabethan writers of romances assimilated much renaissance sentiment but it is not until wo reach nashs studies in real life at the close of the sixteenth century that the medico val leaven is superseded lyly with his wealth of illustration drawn from the scientific speculations of the middle ages and his fanciful descriptions of athens or naples and greene with his stories of knights and kings and courts of chivalry look like lineal descendants of the jongleurs of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they reflect the past and despite m jusserands ingenious and luminous suggestions to the contrary only occasionally foreshadow the future but m jusserand has invested his accounts of lylys work and of that of lylys successors with so much fresh and appreciative comment that it will be impossible hereafter to refuse to these survivals a literary any less than an historical interest lylys hero euphues becomes an attractive figure in the skilful hands of m jusserand but euphuess undoubted affinity at some points to richardsons heroes does not convince us quite so readily as m jusserand is convinced that he is in any literal sense  the ancestor in direct line of grandison  or of lord orville the theory at any rate needs further testing of sidney and pastoral romance of thomas nash and the picaresque novel and of english fiction in the seventeenth century m jusserand treats with far more judgement and knowledge than any of our own countrymen have devoted to the subjects m jusserand is able at times to render his criticism and information more effective by drawing upon his knowledge of french literature for illustrative comments sir thomas malorys sole mention of himself or of his personal opinions throughout his monumental epic is in a short chapter in which he laments the decay in his day of virtuous love m jusserand well contrasts the cold seriousness characteristic of the english romancewriter with the impetuous warmth of the author of aucassin and nicolette the relations between early english and french literature have never been fully investigated and the fact that french translations of greenes romances and of sidneys  arcadia became while elizabeth was still queen almost as popular in paris as the originals were in london will be news for many wellinformed students of our literary history some of them may not be more familiar with the circumstance that the debts which french readers of romance contracted to english authors in the sixteenth century were amply repaid in the seventeenth century when english lovers of fiction satiated themselves with the interminable romances of scud cry or la calprenede in english versions these international amenities which have been much neglected by literary historians are worth dwelling on and in the elaborate history of english literature on which it is generally understood m jusserand has long been engaged we may fairly anticipate to find them fully discussed the points of interest about this book are so numerous than it would be impossible to deal with them in detail here but those who read for amusement only may be as safely recommended to procure it as the smaller class who seek to extend their knowledge of the elizabethan epoch which remains the most brilliant of our literature,dom_contra

more interesting than a library of fictions the present history bears the impress of truth and deserves to be extensively read it cannot be pretended that the literary merit is of a very high order but the style is easy and simple and the narrative is pleasingly told  lorenzo benoni or passages in the life of an italian edited by a friend edinburgh constable  co london hamilton  co ix this volume the author an italian refugee writes what is said to be virtually a memoir of his own life in english remarkably correct for a foreigners compositionbut as such naturally wanting in idiomatic spirit and bearing traces of the verbose manner which ordinary italian authors affect in their own language the  passages are such as may readily be conceived to have taken place in the life of a native of genoa born in the middle class and subject to the various domestic and political influences and disturbances of the effect of which this country has already been pretty largely informed by the presence of successive poets of exile in the circumstances peculiar to the author there is nothing very strange or striking and the colour given to them in the narrative is of that dubious tone in which a tint of fiction is so far apparent that the piece can hardly be viewed as an unvarnished picture of real life while it wants the proportion vivacity and inventive character of a pure work of imagination of those details of common life which english readers might be glad to possess there are but few the author being naturally more intent on recording what was important to himself than alive to what would be specially interesting to foreign curiosity the story contains an abundance of school and college reminiscencesa love affair or two of a puerile characterand the progress of what may bc called an established course of italian refugee fortunes through discontent and secret societies to rash designs conspiracy discovery and flightall related in a rather rhetorical style the vapid effect of which may be excused when it is recollected that the writer is expressing himself in a strange idiom in other respects something of individual and national character may be seen whether the matter in question be genuine or sophisticatedas well in the kind of subjects or qualities meant to solicit admiration as in the features that are glossed over and in certain actions and dispositions which are portrayed without the least apprehension of their being open to remark the picture which an understanding eye may thus compose for itself from the lights and shadows of the narrativereflecting far more than appears on its surfacewill be the best result that the book is likely to afford the mere reader for amusement who looks solely to what is directly presented by the author will be apt to find the tale less exciting than a novel and not quite so trustworthy as a simple memoirand so may arrive at the close more disappointed than edified the most substantial passage that we have found in the book is given as the tirade of a certain eccentric  uncle johnwho delivers himself on the heros republican schemes in a strain more national in substance than anything we are used to hear from italian lips on such topics from this time forward politics absorbed our thoughts and furnished the subject of our daily conversations this new bent could not escape the penetration of my uncle john lefore whom i never scrupled to attack the government with the greatest vehemence and who sent himself with all his might to stop me in that course  you see things he would sometimes say not as they are but as your imagination paints them pretty nearly every one i allow despises and detests the government but it does not thrive the less for that analyse society and tell me where you see those manly virtues that spirit of selfsacrifice which regenerate nations look at our nobles for instance the old men sulk at the government do you think it is from the love of liberty  pshaw they do so because they would like to hold the reins themselves the young ones think only of their horses and their mistresses the middle class is eaten up by selfishness  each individual man is engrossed by his office or his counting house or his clientsall in general by the rage for making money number one is their god  but the people uncle  i come to them next the people are ignorant and

B6369,['2719678'],  lize tuice brothers by mrs oliphant london blackwood  sons if this were the first work of a novice we should say that it contains a fair promise of future excellence  but coming as it does from the pen of so accomplished a veteran in literature as mrs oliphant we confess to a feeling of disappointment at the somewhat meagre and frequently slovenly style in which it is written the plot is well conceived and the story opens naturally and gracefully a certain mr renton of renton holding the honourable position of head of a large mercantile house of untarnished reputation has three sons whom he has allowed to grow up if not in absolute idleness at least in the unchecked following of their own inclinationsa kind of life in direct contravention of all the traditions of the renton family his sister an especially obnoxious specimen of the meddling outspoken strongminded woman species casts much opprobrium on him for his parental weakness and gloomily forebodes the decay of all the renton prestige in consequence of the degeneracy of the present generation and their departure from the energetic policy of their ancestors moved by her remonstrances which find an ally in his own fears that his sons training has not been such as to fit them for fighting the battle of life he makes a will in which he directs that for the space of seven years his disposal of his property is to be a secret from every one the capital and interest to accumulate during that time with the exception of a provision made for his widow and an allowance of2oo a year to each son immediately after making this will mr renton is taken ill and dies in a few hours when the will is read the three brothers are naturally amazed at so extraordinary and unexpected a document and are strongly advised by their friends to contest its legality one of the best pieces of writing in the book to our mind is their decision to bear the trial and the unswerving loyalty with which they treat their fathers wishes utterly refusing to question his visdom or try to set it aside their mother a weak hypochondriac is to continue to live at renton and the threebrothersbenj amin lawrence and frank are forthwith to go out into the world to seek their fortunes like the three princes in the fairy tale benjamin the eldest has no profession in particular but after passing though the somewhat useless episodeuseless because it comes to nothing in the endof falling in love with a beautiful adventuress he joins a friend who is going out to south america to build railways and must evidently have been one of those geniuses who are born not made for he soon becomes the master instead of the assistant and rapidly makes a fortune the second brother laurence poor laurie as he is generally called by those who love himis an artist with a pretty amateur studio at kensington who has hitherto led a sort of double life enjoying all the petting and caressing which a goodlooking amiable young man of good family and fortune is sure to receive in fashionable society and at the same time identifying himself largely with the artist profession and its members laurie endeavours to carry out his fathers plans by giving up the pretty studio at kensington taking two rooms close to fitzroysquare investing in a canvas tenfeet square and commencing to represent thereon in the most approved form of high art the novel subject of edith seeking the body of harold with the view of obtaining the admission of his picture to the royal academy thereby securing his own fortune and immortality the descriptions of artistlife are the brightest in the book very pretty is the picture of harry severns widow taking up the brush that death had snatched from her husbands grasp just when fame seemed coming to him very sweet and touching the record of her loving labours for her children and the sympathy of all her artist friends in her wellearned success but the quality in mrs severns character that makes it most attractive is its motherliness and that seems in our opinion marred by making her the object of poor lauries misplaced though lifelong devotion mrs severns surprised terror when she finds that a stranger has stolen in a few interviews the heart of her firstborn the sunshine of her life alice with her curls is told with a good deal of pathos but when we know that this stranger is no other than lauries brother frank there is something incongruous in making two brothers in love one with the mother the other with her daughter young frank the guardsman exchanges into the line and goes to india and the only thoroughly satisfactory love episode in the book is his spontaneous impulsive love at first sight for alice severn thus the three brothers in various ways carry out their fathers plan meeting at renton at the end of seven years to hear their sentence that sentence we conceive to be a mistake but we shall not indicate its nature further feeling sure that all who begin the fortunes of the three brothers wvill follow them to the end for the book is pleasant reading enough though we miss the keen observation and quaint humour that made the authors earlier works so delightful,dom_contra

too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of

critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to

worked out than it would be in those of a less accomplished writer and he does allow a certain amount of feeling to make itself manifest in the third party of the triangle the reader is allowed to be a little sympathetic towards the unfortunate husband or wife whose fickle partner is about to betray him but the fact still remains that mark is a person entirely devoid of soul there seems no influence in his life beyond the desire of the moment and no progress in his development as he was at nineteen so he is at fortyseven and it really was unkind of the author to suppress colonel and mrs

summer we find lennan enamoured of a pretty woman unhappily wedded her position excites all the chivalry of the hero and the author lennan is without humour and so is the lady they live in a rare atmosphere of exquisite emotions which mr galsworthy conveys to us in exquisite prose the result is a little cloying prolonged sentiment is oppressive like the flowers of the syringa however a terrible tragedy on the river clears the air and liberates the hero in autumn we find mark lennana man of fortyfive with a horror of advancing agemarried to sylvia though a sculptor of capacity no

never deserts him with a few masterly strokes he gives us cramier the odious husband and johnny dromore the turf devotee of the goggling eyes we hear the flat cosy confidential voice of the colonels

brief in our remarks upon them and not unnecessarily prolong the punishment of the foolish boy who has hurt himself for life by writing and publishing them of all the spurious descriptions of oxford life that have during the last thirty years emanated from the pens of spurious university men and come under our notice mr william winwood reades sketchesare the most objectionable every where they are dull and false and in numerous places they are marked by an obscenity which will make any gentleman who may unwarily take them up fling them away in disgust it is due to oxford to state that the only mention made of mr reades name in the university calendar is where a place is assigned him amongst the undergraduates of magdalen hall for the year 1857 after which date there is a significant absence of his name from the hst of members oxford had its faults when we were there doubtless it has its faults btill but it must have lamentably deteriorated in tone if any undergraduate could say what mr read has written and not be avoided as a disgrace to his fraternity indeed there is only one term that can fully designate the author of  liberty hall and if on the present occasion we refrain from using it we do so out of respect to the usages of criticism if mr read paints a college breakfastnot amongst the outcasts and contemned hangerson upon university life but the members of  good setsthe reader is told that oxford men at such a repast sit round the table like mine round a trough withcrunchingjawsand bent heads gorging and stupefying themselves with rich illcooked food which they wash down with draughts of heavy beer of the college tutors one of the heroes of the tale speaks in the following elegant and discerning manner  if there is anything which i can at the bame time hate and despise it is an oxford don i despise him as a mean crawling worm compared with the rest of mankind i hate him as a poisoned hissing serpent in whose power so many destinies are thrown go to their common rooms and hear them talk after dinner where they eat like swine hear their vapid sentiments their imbecile remarks look at their faces bloated and bensual or see them in their lecturerooms ignorant stupid cowardly and brutal put yourselves in their power and pray to their cold bare hearts for pity and forgiveness  surely mr winwood read must have at some period of his life prayed in vain to these cold bare hearts but it is not in university fife alone that he displays a familiar acquaintance with men and manners he takes us down from oxford to the countryhouse of richard saxon esq of blakeys deputylieutenant and justice of the peace the lady of the mansion is delicately introduced as one who dosed herself diurnally with castoroil till it turned her into a peevish invalkl the country gentlemen are represented as being on intimate visiting terms with the farmer miller and other tradesmen of the district and the belle of the neighbourhoda lovely creature

serves as the farrago libelli for a satirist whose eye is keen but whose touch is seldom other than kindly the dedication of this new edition of  departmental ditties shows the heinesque mood in which he writes i have eaten your bread and salt i have drunk your water and wine the deaths ye died i have watched beside and the lives that ye led were mine was there aught that i did not share in vigil or toil or ease one joy or woe that i did not know dear hearts across the seas  i have written the tale of our life for a sheltered peoples mirth in jesting guisebut ye are wise and ye know what the jest is worth mr kipling does not love india or at all events the indian climate the stifling atmosphere of the plains and the homesickness it engenders in the english exile are depicted in more than

superiors in a native journal posed as young ithuriel resolute and grim till he found promotion didnt come to him  till he found that reprimands weekly were his lot and his many districts curiously hot but mr kipling can be serious enough if he chooses and does not hesitate to call a spade a spade when occasion demands it the mysteries of bureaucratic administration are pithily exposed in  public waste while the story of uriah and a  study of an elevation in indian ink reveal with surprising frankness the proverbial woman for whom we are bidden to seek in situations that overtax our

think very highly though the swinburnian chorus at the end of it is an ingenious parody enough and full of smart sayings and flashes of insight as is the poem called  one viceroy resigns in which lord dufferin gives his views upon india to his successor in a blankverse monologue one cannot but feel that the smartness is a little overdone and that the thinly veiled allusions to individuals are often in questionable taste from  arithmetic on the frontier which contrasts the value of the lives spent in holding and assailing our empire we quote a couple of stanzas whose horatian aptness and truth

B7680,"['6806200', '3160573', '8844031']",  fiction a tale of the mutiny on the face of the waters by flora annie steel william heinemann mrs steels new story has been sj highly praised already vide press notices passim as quoted in the advertisements that if it were merely for the sake of a change one would be inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses there is a danger we hope it is no more that a somewhat uncritical admiration for the work of the clever lady who has now come to be spoken of as the female rudyard kipling  may do harm both to the authoress and her public the description is neither elegant nor correct for mrs steels resemblance to mr kipling begins and ends in the fact that both write about india from intimate personal knowledge and that the resemblance should strike both critics and public so forcibly is a remarkable sign of the novelty with which this inside handling of indian subjects came upon the masses in whose name our great dependency is ruled is it too much to express a fear that mrs steel has been tempted by thi reception to imagine that she has a mission to inform the british public about the true history of india  in her latest book at any rate the element of history seems to us entirely to overbalance the fiction we hasten to say that so far as the facts are concerned they are admirably portrayed mrs steels capacity as a historian of the indian mutiny is undeniable she is soaked through and through with knowledge of the environment in which she sets her story she is no partisan and her heroworship is combined with justice but after all fiction is fiction it is with some apprehension that the present writer who was one of the first to call attention to the power and beauty of those short sketches of mrs steels which came out anonymously in macmillans sees the authoress compelled to begin her new story with a preface insisting on its historical accuracy and explaining that it intended to be history as well as  story in her own criticism that in such an attempt she will probably fail in either aim mrs steel seems to us to be a better oritic of herself than most authors are it is not from a novelist that we want  every incident scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather it is not for the writer of fiction to boast that i have not allowed the actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings let the local colour be correct by all means but wc make a fetish of realism if such restrictions are put upon what in its essentials is an imaginative art the account of though sham court at delhi says mrs steel  did not need a single touch of fancy in the presentment what a singularly humiliating confession this statement should be if it were true in point of fact as all writers of picturesque history know it cannot be literally true it would only mean that the fancy of one writer was adopted by another and when that other is herself an artist in fiction the result if faithfully pursued would be a literary calamity not so do the great artists use history as scott in ivanhoe or george meredith in vittoria they learn its uses and its limitations the test of the historian is his accuracy but the critic must test mrs steele as a novelist not by her descriptions of the real scenes of the indian mutiny nor by her clever transcriptions of the chronicles but by the human beings and human characters wbich she invents the passions and ideas with which she invests them by the play of her creative talent round the creatures of her imagination as they move through the world which she has chosen as their environment and by her capacity for making an artistic unity out of the variety of circumstances it is in this respect that on the face of the waters is weak the desire to tell the whole history of the siege of delhi has interfered seriously with the human interest in the story up to p 210 there is a definite elot in the relations between major erlton is wife and his mistress but when mrs gissing falls the first of the women victims at delhi mrs steel violently removes the whole moral situation to which she seemed to be working upremoves it just at the climax when mrs erlton learns that another woman is to be a mother by her husband in a scene which till its natural sequel is ruthlessly cut off is full of promise for the working out of a most interesting problem of life alice gissing is certainly the most human of the characters in this story her relations with erlton whose wife is represented at first as bound to him by the nominal tie only are described with rare and even audacious sympathy  and when this chain of circumstance is abruptly snapped there is nothing to take its place the final two hundred pages one half of the book have no real human interest except the historical one mrs steel apparently intended the relations between jim douglas and mrs erlton to supply it but the sympathy of the reader is not aroused their adventures in the town in hiding while the mogul reigns in delhi and the british troops are besieging it from the ridge are most brilliantly narrated but they are the adventures of isolated beings both of them as bloodless as any men or women could be in such a situation and mrs steel evidently felt the mechanical aspect of their union after major erltons death when she relegated it to an appendix this division of the story into two parts one dealing with alice gissing and major erlton and the other with mrs erlton and jim douglasdeprives it of unity which is not adequately attained by the part played by douglas in both portions what unity the volume has is given by its history of the siege of delhi and to say this is to praise mrs steel the historian at the expense of mrs steel the novelist while we maintain that a great novel is not to be composed bv giving an historical background to several brilliantly interwoven episodes it must be admitted that mrs steel does ive us of her best in the way of episode in on the face of the waters all that relates to the natives whether to the sepoys or the court or the town is admirable and the sketches of british military and civil life are absolutely convincing mrs steel sees detail everywhere and records it minutely but she is full of humanity in the broader sense and can give us the mysticism of the oriental as faithfully as the easyoing morality of the angloindian each incident almost each chapter is a picture by itself revealing an extraordinary wealth of descriptive power and a masterly insight into character the disappointment is that with so muoh that is brilliant by itself the book as a whole finally lacks the intense interest which would be expected but mrs steel is so exceptionally gifted that we shall hope to see her shake off the disintegrating tendency which has so fatally pursued some of our best writers of sketches and short stories  novel notes on the face of the waters by f a steel 6s heinemann we do not meet with a novel of this order once in ten years it is a monument of patient labour a storehouse of precise facts on its imaginative side it is strong and deeply impressive architecturally it is a wonderbut we did not recognise this very early mrs steels aim was to write a history of the indian mutiny which should at the same time be a work of fiction the fiction to serve the history by lighting it up with living human interest as to her facts she says the reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part which real men took in it is scrupulously exact even in the date the hour the scene the very weather a critic of fiction has most concern with the other part and there we hold that mrs steel has used her vast array of knowledge with great skill that she has made us realise as we never did before the signs of the oncoming storm the mystery and tragedy of it the sensations of the natives loyal and disaffected and of the angloindians no one has taken such trouble before save historians and they have left the imagination out of the fineness of the detail it is impossible to speak too highly or of the great mental force that has shaped the mass of facts personalities sensations into a whole but it has the defects of its qualities

mutiny or on the part real men took in it is scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather nor have i allowed the actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings this statement is we believe strictly accurate and the local colouring is singularly exact the tale too is as valuable as it is interesting for it gives an excellent insight into the native side of the indian mutiny and into the characters of some of the leading personages  such as for instance the king and queen of delhi the moulvie and bukht khan on the other hand it brings vividly before us the conduct and bearing of some of the principal fighters on the british side such as nicholson and hodson moreover it most wholesomely revives our recollection of the scandalous behaviour of the majorgeneral commanding at meerut and the want of energy and independence displayed by brigadier archdale wilson the author notwithstanding her general accuracy has perpetrated one or two little mistakes for example she defines krani as lowcaste english whereas it really is the contemptuous term applied to halfcastes again she is historically inaccurate when she writes of the rifle brigade having been engaged at budle  ke  serai it was the 60th rifles who took part in that action the rifle brigade not having been represented in india till several months later viewed simply as a novel the book is well and vigorously written but we regret to find that the author is unable to shake herself free from the objectionable habit prevalent among so many lady writers of dragging in the sexual question freely this blemish renders the work unsuitable for young people,dom_contra

of sufferings born for the sake of a creed which the sufferers believe to be the one supreme form of religious truth through which alone their prayers to the god and father of all can be offered have the power to make the heart of every generous reader burn within him for they appeal to the deepest instincts and highest sympathies of our human nature this sympathyis quite irrespective ofthe creed of the sufferers in stories all the political elements which gave rise to the strife are kept out of sight and we are shown only the innocent victims to the stern laws of the dominant party in troublous times so whether they be tales of the early christians persecuted under the roman emperors tales of christiana persecuted by other christians for points of inaccuracy in their formulas persecutions of the albigenses persecutions of the huguenot persecutions of the early reformation by the church regnant or persecutions of the roman catholics when the reformed church became dominant in england or the cruelties against the covenanters in scotland the reader can feel only sympathy with the victims martyrs give the supreme testimony to the faith for which they suffer and every feuowreatiur who reads their story feels proud of theil courage and constancy but that is because the political passions the fear and the deadly strife of tongues have all passed away and left un capable of discerning the still sad music of humanity which was ever going on in the midst of the confused noise and the garments rolled in blood we recognise in the sufferers men and brethren now that they can no more offend us by their diversities of opinion it is only on the surface of the ocean that the waters rage and swell a very little way below the surface is perfect calm lady georgiana fullerton has chosen for her theme the sufferings that religious catholics had to incur in the early days of the reformation when spanish armadas papist conspiracies and a roman catholic retender to the throne gave rise to penal aws against the roman catholics as severe and stringent as the fears of the dominant party could devise or their power enforce swarms of contemptible informers and  base betrayers of their brothers blood aroseas they have done in all times of persecution as they will ever do in her story lady georgiana introduces the record of most of the roman catholic sufferers whose names are many of them little known to the protestant general reader but which  are carefully enshrined in the memory of their  own church she also speaks of other men as  saints and martyrs who were deeply involved io the intricate politics and conspiracies of the period and who suffered for them quite as much as for their religion she paints from the roman catholic point of view and keeps entirely to the religious aspect of the struggle in her pages the catholics are oppressed men only desirous of worshipping with freedom in their own mannerwhich the laws then existing forbade under pain of death and confiscation lady georgiana fullerton always writes with grace and refinement she does not give highlywrought scenes of horror  on the contrary she is studiously selfrestrained and moderate the heroine is a fictitious personage a certain mistress constance sherwood a gentlewoman in the reign of queen elizabeth much attached to the ancient faith and connected either by consanguinity or friendship with many notable persons who suffered for their adherence to their religion most of the secondary personages are real people and the incidents narrated are for the most part quite true the references are given at the end of the third volume the story of constance sherwood is a touching picture of life under a reign of terror and penal laws there is no plot it is merely the record of the lisa of constance sherwood from year to yearof the fears temptations and difficulties under which she and her friends held fast their faith and of the testimony which many amongst them sealed with their blood the passages in the life of the countess of arundel and surrey are taken from the history of that noble house of course everything that could jar upon the readers sympathy is kept out of sight and all the catholics in the book are the most excellent of the earth the incidents of heroic generosity and selfsacrifice are told with a chastened enthusiasm which increases the readers admiration the sentiments which all the catholics express are of the purest and noblest religious virtuesuch as all christian men and women ought to feel lady georgiana fullerton has written a book  which no one can read without deep interest i g and she has written it in an admirable spirit s substituting the reformed religion for the s roman catholic it is just such a work

which onco enthralled thousands in awestruck attention alter gradually as years go on till a bare handful will listen to his garrulous maunder not out of interest for what he says but from a respectful recollection of what he was mr black was never a great statesman nor a brilliant orator but he wrote two extremely clever novels of which the bracing salt breezes came breathing freshness into though readers of mudie over tired as they were of sensational twaddle or prurient millinery in  green pastures and piccadily the author tried a new but a less successful line and  madcap violet could not but leave a most unpleasant impression nothing but his name obtained readers for these two novels if they had been written by an anonymous novice they wtould we a enture to assert have soon disappeared in the unknown regions whither bad books go thia last is unfortunately a great deal worse than it3 two predecessors it shows indeed more traces of mr blacks special talent than  green pasturesthere is more gaelic in it and we find plenty of those clouds and hills and boats and sunsets over the lake3 and other wordpainting which in though  princess of thule we took to be genius but which we now find are only a knack but the story is so wildly absurd and improbable the style is so exaggerated and the mixture of scotch gaelic and english so tedious that we lay the book down with two heavy sighs one denotes gratification at having finished it the other regret that a man who once am usd us so well and made us think should now bore us so thoroughly and only succeed in making us yawn sir keith macleod of dare is the son of a mother who strange to say has given birth to four baronets the mystery is explained by the fact that her other sons wrere all killed in succession either in the crimea or by north american indians or on the gold coast or at koniggratz keith though youngest and only surviving one goes to london to enjoy himself and is taken by a friend to the house of a mr3 ross who lives in south kensington here ho is invited to lunch but so light is thc young mans head as were his heels when he jumped out of a capsized hansom en route that even before he has tasted any wine he becomes intoxicated by the cent of flowers the rosecoloured curtains and the soft wees to which he is introduced he oats asparagus soup for luncheon an 1 the result of this dish taken at so untimely an hour is that he entertains a certain lovely miss vv lute with a multitude of scotch legends for threequarters of an hour in a back room although miss white knows nothing of scotland or singing she entrances keith on their return to the rest of the company by warbling some scotch ditties when they leave the house his friend suggests that they should spend the evening at the piccadilly theatre on the chance of meeting miss white again macleod consent a atd fvjta to nd a n th hi ho inovo for her in the playbill and lo she is there henceforward he gives up all thought of his cousin janette whom his mother was keeping for him at castle dare and his whole object is to make gertrude white his wife this young lady is at first tempted by the prospect of becoming lady macleod but when her sister a precocious damsel of fourteen lectures her on the folly of leaving the stage and sternly opposes the marriage she gives up the idea and turns a cold shoulder on her lover who meanwhile has performed sundry acts of bravery and generosity not the least among the latter is his protection of a small boy who is neglected by his poor parents he takes this boy home to scotland makes a jackofallwork of him and on his return to town calls on johnnys mother to tell her how her son is getting on and after giving her a satisfactory account of him he adds  here is his first quarters wages at the same time munificently handing her the sum of thirteen shillings which lavish generosity of course calls down many blessings on his head major stewart the friend who accompanies our hero on this his second visit to london is decidedly amusing his advice to keith on no account to marry a sigher is good as miss white is obdurate macleod resorts to a stratagem to win her he persuades her to come on board his yacht which is lying in the thames he locks her up in the cabin sets sail and is off to scotland and every one on board seems smitten with silence although gertrude is by no means a willing prisoner and the thames is as full of craft as fleetstreet of carriages he keeps her closely confined till they reach scotland then foreseeing a storm he puts his crew on shore cuts the vessel adrift and is drowned with his beloved in a flash of very forked lightning of course he is quite mad and was probably invented to be a pendant to violet who it will be remembered also became insane from disappointed affection mr black clearly hankers after pairs of novels like other people after pairs of candelabra or pairs of horses but we hope we shall be preserved from another novel to make up the pair with  green pastures and piccadilly a number of the most eminent artists have been called in to illustrate this book and some of the sketches of rock and sea are excellent but too many cooks have spoilt the picture of the hero macleod mr pettie shows him on the frontispiece in full highland costume about to open or shut a door opposite page 100 he is represented by mr graham leaning on the parapet of the thames embankment and although st pauls and waterloo bridge are beautiful in the distance macleod is not in the least like what he was at the beginning of the book and when he gets home and kisses hamishs granddaughter his appearance is again entirely altered thanks to a third artist who delineates his features this cooperative principle has we think hardly proved successful and we recommend mr black to confine himself to wordpainting in future or if he must have pictures to entrust them all to the same pencil,dom_contra

talked thus the encarmined blossom of the bignonia to me a symbol of the sweetest sentiment i had carefully preserved in a glass i had placed it on the dressingtable of my chamber with its peduncle immersed in water lovers male and female have in all ages we suppose put cherished flowers in water but they would scarcely recognise the familiar instinct under such wonderful terms lovers may and do talk a great deal of nonsense no doubt but a young man might record his preference of a blonde beauty in less stilted language there was another contrast that had at this time an influence on my hearts inclinings to an eye fatigued with dwelling long and continuously on the dark complexions of the south the olivine hue of azec and iberian skins there was a relief in the radiance of this carmined blonde c but we would have forgiven all that if the progress of though story had not been slackened to allow whole ages of this sort of writing to find a place we also complain that the author who although many miles distant could know and tell us all that passed in the secret interview between the mormon apostle and huhman holt the father of the two heroines also what passed in the glade of the forest and the despair of the young hunter in his solitude never  tells us a word about how marian went away with the mormon nor how she discovered his villainy nor how she escaped from

relate their own heroic exploits as well as those of their ancestors and even to illustrate the conversation by boasting of battles they were never in  3 we command that every beggar carry a good cudgel in his hand with a spike at the end of it if possible to be provided against emergencies lest they repent of their neglect  4 that each beggar take especial care never to presume to wear any thing new that all his clothes be worn out torn or patched nothing bringing more scandal on the profession than begging in good clothes be it however well understood that if in the exercise of his professional duties a beggar chance to obtain somne new garment he is at liberty to deck himself out in it for that day but no longer we positively will and command that he dispose of it the following morning  5 to prevent any dispute that may arise between comrades for certain posts we ordain that the moor e ancient possessor prevail and take precedence without regard to persons  6 it is permitted

keep opposite each other on different sides of the street each singing his own misfortunes they may afterwards divide their profits as they please 7 it is permitted that a beggar wear an old dishclout round his head in winter instead of a bonnet that while he is protected from the cold he may at the same time appear an invalid they are likewise at liberty to walk with crutahes or to have one leg tied up behind them  8 every beggar may have a purse and a pocket but must receive alms in their hats only  9 we command that no beggar be so indiscreet as to divulge any of the mysteries of our trade

who lltut har hand a cavalicr of gome called dorido a young man of an illustrious family an engaging person and great bravery fell in love with a young lady of the name of clorinia who was about seventeen years old virtuous beautiful and of equal rank the relations of this charming girl brought her up with so much care that they would not allow her to make any connexion by which her virtue might be at all endangered she was hardly ever suffered even to approach her latticed window lest some misfortune should be the consequence as no one could gaze upon her extreme beauty with impunity either her father or her mother or her brother valerio attended her every where and watched her every action some months ago dorido having accidently obtained a sight of her became violently enamoured  but could declare his love by no other means than by casting empassioned glances towards the window of her chamber when she happened to be there as he passed by the house if the homage of his eves was not always remarked by the object of it at least it was sometimes noticed  at all events it was practised often enough to produce the wishedfor effect  clorinia at first was satisfied with looking at the cavalier without being seen but soon she felt a wish that he should see her also without knowing why she wished it and answering by little and little to his amorous looks she at last conceived a passion in the same way in which she had inspired it i mean by appearing at her lattice dorido soon guessed that he had made on her all the impression he desired and since he was denied more indulged himself in the transports of believing himself beloved nevertheless lie sought to reap a more solid satisfaction from his conquest lie contrived to form an acquaintance with valerio and succeeded so well as to attach him in such a degree that they were inseparable a valerio could no longer live without his friend dorido they were always together sometimes at one house sometimes at another this gave iorido an opportunity of sometimes seeing his charmer aid even speakingg to her but never alone thie eves of the lovers alone communicated to each other the secrets of their hearts this state of affairs however did not last for ever clorinia mdle her maid scintila the confidant of her passion  this old woman wlho had wit and wished to serve her mistress called uipon dorido and having met with him  noble cavaliet said she  you need not attempt to disguise the truth from me i know tile state of your heart you love clorinia and i am niuch mistaken if your love is not returned you are both dying with impatience for an interview and i cannot see your situation without pity i shall never rest till i have procured you the satisfaction you both so ardently desire the lover transported with joy at these words thanked the dtuenna for her good will assuring her that she should not find him ungrateftul if she succeeded then making use of so excellent an opportunity he wrote a very passionate billet which he conjured her to convey to the amiable sister of valerio scintila returned immediately to her mistress to acquaint her with the step she had taken and presented her with loridos letter clorinia blamed her for taking charge of itbut soon forgave her nothing was now thought of but how to manage the interview with the lovers the lady raised so many difficulties that she would have relinquished it altogether if the old woman who was more ingenious had not hit upon a plan they both approved of scintilas ledelhamber was on the ground floor and adjoining to her room there was another which was filled with old and useless furniture this room was lighted only by a small window defended by two strong bars of iron through which there was only room sufficient for a hand to pass this window which was about five or six feet from the ground looked into a lane or blind alley quite uninhabited and the place appeared exactly suited to lovers who were satisfied to limit their happines to conversation only the old woman as soon as she saw her young mistress disposed to speak with jorido through this little window hastened to inform the cavalier who on the ensuing night at eleven oclock placed himself at a convenient spot lie approached the bars where he found scintila expecting him she requested him to wait patiently until the servants were gone to bed lie did not languish long in suspense the wishedfor moment soon arrived clorinia came trembling to the window at which her lover presented himself in speechless agitation as they both now loved for the first time they were agitated at the sight of each other and the excess of their feelings at first prevented them from speaking but love has more than one language the lady passed one of her beautiful hands between the bars of the window and the lover clasping it with ardour covered it with a thousand kisses at last by degrees they broke silence and indulged in passionate protestations of eternal love their souls were so entirely occupied by the pleasure of seeing each other that they would have suffered daylight to find them together if the old woman had not interrupted their conversation to warn them that it was time to seplarate before he would retire dorido entreated his mistress to allow him to return the next night at the same hour to the window and the lady could not resolve to refuse him this favour at last they separated equally delighted with the conversation they had just had with each other and filled with impatience for another interview lorido especially was too much agitated to be able to take any rest or to speak more correctly he was miserable until the time of his reiurn to the window you may easily suppose he did not fail to be punctual his mistress finding no obstacle to her design appeared again at the same place and their meeting was the second time less embarrassed by timidity than the first the cavalier who had a great deal of wit said a tliouialtld fine things to his mistress who replied to them in as lively a manner this conversation lasted for three hours and tfleir discourse was mingled with innocent caresses  so that the second interview pleased them both as much as the first che prudent scintila was again obliged to separate them again and again they accused her of cruelty not reflecting that though she disturbed their pleasures it was only with a view to render them more lasting for in fact they continued to enjoy their stolen interviews with so much secrecy and good management that not a soul livjiugt knew of them but the old woman and one other person t this other person was a young man of rank namded horatio a native of this city lie also loved clorinia having by chance seen her at her lattice and had revealed his love to her by signs  but finding them very badly received he concluded that he had a rival wsho was mole happy and judged that rival to he lorido as he was united in so strict a friendship with valerio to clear upi his wellfounded suspicions he sought out dorido who was one of his friends to vwhom lie spoke in these words  aly dear dorido i am come to ask a favour of yno and i conjure you not to refuse me my happiness depends upon it you are cointinually with valerio  you very often visit at his house aid i cannot help thinking that vou ale in love with his sister  if i ami mistaken in my conjectures oblige me by declaring it y ou are too well deserving the heart of that lady for me to venture to dispute it with you  you love clorinia then exclaimed iorido a little ruffled i i confess that i am quite charmed with her replied ihoratio  but nevertheless i do you justice and agree that you dese rve letter than i can the happiness of being her husband  lhet us speak without flatterv interrupted dorido  i should doubtless consider myself highly honoured in hecoiningr the husband of clorinia but  frankly eonfess to you that i have no designi to marry her  is it possible cried horatio eagerly  that you do not mean to mnarry her all i my friend how different are my intentions from yours aly highest ambition is to unite my fate with hers  your views should yield to mine  sacrifice the mad hopes you have conceived i expect this effort from your friendship and your virtue  you might add said dorido  that i owe it to the family of lorinia yes continued lie  i will leave the field open to you and if valerios sister should accept your addresses and consent to give you her hand i will cease to be your rival i vill do more i will speak in your favour and i assure you that in that case it shall not be my fault if your wishes are not fulfilled horatio was so well satisfied w ith this speech that he testified his gratitude to iorido without thinking that his promise ivas only conditional and therefore that he ought to mistrust it lie made no reflection of this kind but even requested dorido to use his good offices in his behalf with clorinia dorido could not but be touched at the frankness of horatio and being generosl ellough to prefer the huippiness of his friend to his own inclinations as his views were purer he resolved to do all in his power to wean his affections from this lady in fact the very next time he saw her he addressed her thus  you are not ignorant madam that horatio is added to the ntinber of your slaves lut i am doubtful whether you know how truly he adores you learn then that he thinks only of you and that to receive your hand is the only wish of his heart  i am chairmed to hear it replied clorinia  my reception of him shall convince you how little i wish for any lover but dorido   well know replied the cavalier  the value of a preference so glorious for me but i should think that i abused your goodness if i wvas not capable of some selfdenial  horatio has inany good qualities and when you know him better you will not be srrv perhaps if your friends should second ils wishes  how l cried the lady  to hear you is enough to make me believe that you wish to make me miserable is it possible that you can wish me to reply to the tenderness of horatio i i never answered dorido   i have no such thought i only wished to convince you that if you feel any inclination for lloratio and your friends approve of his addresses my heart would in vain rebel  that i would sacrifice mnselfto the happiness of my rival to show you how entirely devoted i am to all your vishes  i fear replied she  that the victim would be as submissive as you represent him and that your love for me is not quite so sincere as you profess it to be but continued she  i do not pretend to put you to the trial dorido shall be my first lover and my last upon this assurance you may rely let horatio persevere as much as he pleases in his love for me he will never be more successful i will confess to you that i was acquainted with his passion which i learned from his gestures before my window and have been so little pleased lb it that i have conceived a dislike for him which almost borders on hatred  after these words iorido did not dare to mention hioratio again as he perceived very plainly that the topic was extremely disagreeable to clorinia lie changed the conversation for the rest of the time they were together and the night was passed in mutual lrotestations of eternal love on the next day dorido received a visit from horatio i well my friend said the latter i have you seen clorinia  did any thing fall from her lovely lips which could be interpreted in my favour  i am very sorry replied the other  that i cannot give you a very flattering account you have but little room for hope 1 extollrd your merit i pointed out the splendour of the alliance i represented you as much more in love with her than perhaps you really are  but the cruel beauty silenced me by declaring that she could not reply to your love and that the soft bonds of ilymen should never unite her fate with yours at these words lioratio turned pale and fell into a profound reverie  while uorido symathising in hlis grief like a true friend pointed out to him that he ought to reliiiilnih his pretensions rather than attempt to constrain the incli nations of clorinta and that there were in room many other ladies equally amiable who would do more justice to his merit  to conclude my dear horatio added he  i am sure i have given you no cause to be dissatisfied with me i would willingly have yielded the sister of alerio to you provided she had been at all inclined to fiavour your passion i would have made this sacrifice to friendship can you now refuse to abandon a conquest that you are by no means sure to gain  horatio theit broke silence and replied to his friend far from reproacling you i must consider

way to win our favour by merely refusing to let his newest hero sit and wait till his ideal lady comes along to go on a walkingtour to find a wife may sound a trifle too deliberate for romance but then grant a little allegory and it seems all right of his companions of the road we have rather more than a speaking acquaintance with three or four alastor it must be confessed is our favourite and alastor is no golden girl but a charming boy with the star of hope upon his brow and  little wings of haste upon his feet eager for life but life in the empyrean with all the scorn of twenty for the cold wisdom of his elders we should indeed have preferred his company on the quest but we had only the chance of a short meeting then after sundry adventures we fell in with nicolete fishing by the banks of a stream an independent vivacious rather overmature young woman of twenty at least so we guessed from her conversation but the shrewd quester quickly made up his mind that though she was adorable she was a little too young to spend his life with a few days however he does not grudge and in response to her request they set off together and alone on their wanderingfor ever she believes as the sun is shining in the merry month of may we following at a discreet distance prepare to enjoy their adventure enormously but such is their haste or our discretion that we never quite know what happened on the waysunstroke perhapsto reduce the independent and intellectual young woman to sheer inanity when the angry father comes to take her off his hands the hero has our congratulations if not our sympathy then there is sylvia joy whose petticoat and stockings hanging on a clothesline he fell in love with and whose further acquaintance he made when he was benevolently meddling in the affairs of a young married couple who had played away their happiness out of a foolish respect for theory sylvia is quite evidently not the golden girl in his haste he said she would do instead only she preferred her own good professional incomeshe was a talented dancerto anything but the most substantial chance of matrimony semiramis the american with her air of pathetic devotion to every male being within the range of her eyes he perhaps never took very seriously for though they went through the mystic rite of  pressing each others feet under the table at their first meeting that apparently is not the kind of thing the golden girl is in the habit of doing and meanwhile a face had haunted him a face set round with chestnut hair which he met one day on an  apocalyptic moorland he met it again years afterfor the walkingtour did not end his questin piccadilly and it was set about this time with golden locks the quest is at an end his one discontent is with the altered hue time can undo what art has done but she prophecies the death of their happiness when the chestnut hue returns is there symbolism here perhaps it is our own suggestion not the heros that only whilst an artificial light dwelled about elizabeth could the romance remain mr le gallienne will not kill the romance he lets her die instead his hero is puzzled over the psychology of this woman of his heart so should we be if we accepted his view of the matter why should he not love a lovable outcast why to explain his devotion to an unhappy woman who has fallen low should he insist that in spite of all her history she was a puritan  to read sundayschool stories and to think atheists the most depraved of human beings is not to be a puritan he should have the proud courage of his love or give it up besides the girls of a more or less golden hue this hero found some other entertaining things he discovered the foolishness of theory for instance and pleasantly illustrates the same he promulgates some opinions and theories of his own too which we may find amusing without endorsing for example that gipsies being now along with waterfalls and ruined castles  the public property of the emotions

largely of unconsciousness of wrongdoing  is more relevant to our criticism we base our doubt of the converse of this on the very book before us mr le gallienne is not at all unconscious he desires and mean to be naughtynot wicked of course but the result is innocent enough it is the naughtiness of a boy in his teens however that is suggested not that of a man in his thirties good enough for fooling distasteful for sentiment mr le gallienne is not always fooling but the truth is we are handicapped in our appreciation of his fantasy by the too wide difference between his views of the romantic and our own we knew it when we reached p 48 where occurs the story of the love of the lady of the manor she was once an actress for the village schoolmaster they used to meet in the dingle and laugh and love and drink champagne  when it all came out there was a regular cartload of bottles found there the heart of mr le galliennes hero waxed soft at the tale i retraced my steps to the

been adopted by younger writers with irritating frequency here the idea of a walking tour in search of the golden girl or ideal wife suits the desultory and fanciful irresponsibility of mr le gailiennes style the adventures of the hero related in the first person are very loosely strung together with little confidences to the reader and reflections on the lack of progress in the story which smack of  padding at other times the author is fluent to excess his reflections on a single look are 44 similarly in that moment i seemed to have dived into this unknown girls eyes to have

of her eyes there is more yet hut this will probably suffice and surely oaths barmaids ana whiskeyandsoda were out of place in a fanciful and frankly impossible idyl such as this mr le gallienne has enough wit and fancy to do without these wearisome adjuncts of some modern humour the plain sensuality of many pages the insistence on details modern taste has agreed to leave unmentioned is a much more serious matter sentimental journeys nowadays should surely leave out some of sternes effects there is here not to mince matters much of that odd and most uncomfortable coarseness which we are

excelnce the hilumlorist of galicia yet miss dowie in writinlg of the coumntry refers to its greatest ian of letters only in slighting terms the ruthenian peasant appears to bec a pagan in everything

mind   was the answer are they not drunk too  no wonder that after the scene in the publichouse to which the peasants adjourned from their church miss dowie retired to a pine wood with  qualms of wrongheaded western disgust she did not remain there very long and the following paragraph is too characteristic not to quote  that sunday afternoon i ended only with it halfcross halfamused feeling that hang it there the people were and one miight us well take an interest in them and not sheer off at the first evidences of a depressing lack of sanity colossal soiiousness and lone prayerful

miss owio deseribes thon with no affection but without prejudice tliere is no persecution of the jews as the peasantry do not resent their supremacy the jew is practical enterprising  the zuthenian has the negatives of these qualities the consequence is that the trade of the country is almost exclusively in the hands of jews but this is no hardship with the ruthenian  lie neither cares for wealth nor for what it brings miss dowio tells an incident that happened during her stay in mikuliczyn a man who wanted his house roofed went to a peasant whose trade was woodslate dressiiig alnd setting and attempted to extract an estimate and press a contract upon him the peasant woulh not accept a contract and would not give an estimate so the man had recourse to a jewn  leave it to me said the jew as lie went to the hut of the very peasant who had refused the offer of the job having extracted all necessary information the jew made his akulation saw his employer gave him an estimate entered into a contract set his peasant to work at a small daily wage and secured for himself a handsome profit does the peasant resent such treatment  according to miss dowiecertainlv not ier description of her encounter with the jewess will reveal a new trait in the foreign hebrew to most english readers at a halfway house where miss dowie stopped to eat some food she took a plate from the shelf to place her sheeps cheese upon the fury of her hostess when she returned and saw her guest using her plate was curious to read of the indescribably dirty jewess considered the scotch lady  unclean it gradually dawned on our authoress that she was a christian and therefore in a technical sense indubitably unclean she accordingly bought the plate and slipped it into her sack the loss of her property which had been purchased at its owners valuation was again too much for the innkooper who upbraided her guest both as a christian and a robber the treatment she received from the ruthenian peasants and the polish gentlemen with whom she stayed was very different aliss dowios book is proof if proof were wanting that an accurate and picturesque account of a people can be written by one ignorant of their language in a country not five thousand miles away from galicia the queen of england was some years ago represented by a very able diplomatist who reckoned among his many accomplishments a knowledge of the native language although the press of the country was an open book to him the people of the country remained an unsolved mystery le did not like them lie misread their characters their aspirations and their hopes happily for all concerned this very able and amiable man for lie was both got the promotion which he deserved le was followed by a gentleman who though unable to read their newspapers liked the connon folk and sympathised with them in their hopes and aspirations le therefore knew the country and its inhabitants a thousandfold better than his more learned but less sympathetic predecessor as with diploiatists so with travellers the key to a good book of travel is sympathy with the people among whom you travel miss dowie has struck this note in every page of her book we have referred to the cynicism which crops up now and again but in truth this cynicism is not more than worddeep miss dowio describes with profound insight the poor ignorant peasantry she has far too much humour to be a severe judgo even her verbal cynicism disappears when she enters cracow  suddenly a choir of trunpets breaks out into a chorale from the big church tower the melancholy of it i never shall forgetthe very melody seemed so old and tired so worn and sweet and patient like cracow those trumpet notes have mouried in that tower for hundreds of years it is the hymn of timeless sorrow that they play and the key to which they are attuned is cracows long despair hush that is her voice the old towns voice high and sad she is spealdng to you the map is in itself a valuable lesson in history showing as it does the widest extent of poland prior to its dismemberment the illustrations are pretty and the drawing by a fletcher on p 131 is charming miss dowie in her closing sentence remarks that she does not flatter herself that her readers would hid her write often we have far too good an opinion of miss dowie to wish her such a fate but we do hope that this book will not be her last j g cotton minchin,dom_contra

B2044,['4380498'],  the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the time watched by three brahmin priests in disguise at the taking of seringapatam john hernoastle an english officer is met by one of his relations at the treasury of the palace and under rather suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about the place he starts for the neighbouring town a few miles off and deposits the moonstone with a banker there by the time the birthday iarrives rachel has refused another cousin godfrey ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them sergeant cuff an eminent detective is brought down friud london but rachel refuses to give him any information and strange to say she completely onto her old lover and will hold no communication with him sergeant cuffs suspicions point to rachel herself he thinks that she has used the diamond for the purpose of raising motey to pat her debts and thae she has been aided by rosanna spearman one of the servants a deformed girl who had been brought up as a thief and whom lady verinder had received from a reformatory xnny circumstances point to rosainna as the guilty person the newlypainted door leading to rachels sittingroom has bean smeared and the smear must have been made by thi thiin the night clothing of all the servante is found eorredt but rosanna is known to have purchased sode cloth at the vtiaseand to have been engaged in her own room making aomethi in addition the detective discover that she bhs bought a tin box and chain and sinks them i the shivering sads on th coast and not

mysterj unexplained in time however all is cleared up a oommunicative assistant to a country doctor had whilst his master wine delirious taken down his ravings and got at the fact that one of the gentlemen at the birthday dinnerpartywe will not disclose the authors secret by saying whowas drugged with opium the assistant is of opinion and finds his view fortified by a passage from carpenters

tried in the presence of witnesses and a sham diaeod is tva in the same way that the real one had been but be d affording some proof not very strong that the suspeted indivml was not a thief the meas adopted are rsultflss as the sleoini drops the piece of glass upon the floor and sinks off to shop rachels solicitor andl friend 3fr bruff however has good reason for suspecting that the diamond has been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old steward had less to say about robinson crusoe miss clacks narrative is intended to convey the idea of a meddlesome fanatic but it is merely a broad burlesque of the character,dom_contra
