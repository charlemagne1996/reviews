book by vernon lee otherwise miss viola paget is far too well known to require to be dealt with at length the present volume of vanitas polite stories which the authoress describes as sketches of frivolous women is a second edition in which has been included a new story entitled a frivolous conversion the heroine madame nitzenko middleaged commonsensible charming sarcastic kindly and russian is one of a party stopping at the engadiner hof her vishvis is count kollonitz a young man of the world who has done everything and seen everything and who has worked out for himself a kind of philosophy of life which can be turned and twisted to suit his present mood from the depths of an armchair madame nitzenko riddles his philosophy with her common sense and pricks his overweening vanity with her sharp tongue little by little however the young count loses his first dislike of her seeks her out and discusses life and its component parts the charm and value of the story lie in the psychology and characterisation the atmosphere is bright and gay and the various philosophies under discussion are treated with the light and skilful pen which miss paget knows so well how to wield the second heroine created by miss rhoda broughton is of quite a different mould though by some strange coincidence the action of the story takes place in a similar milieu the devil and the deep sea is the name of the book and it must be read from cover to cover all by herself lonely and shrinking from attention this young girl sits among the flexes her face stamped with the lines of suffering she thinks of the past with horror and fright and is only recalled to the possibilities of the present and future by the sight of a man in even worse plight than herself battered and broken lying helplessly in an invalid chair in the golden sunlight her sorrow is partially obliterated by the sight of his and pity for his loneliness makes her do little things for him in spite of his rudeness and obvious detestation of being noticed at all she finds out that he too has a past which it is his one object in life besides that of getting well to keep secret this mutual tie draws her sympathies still more and she protects him from the importunities of the other visitors in the hotel step by step she overcomes his timidity and reserve in a charmingly unassuming manner and compels him to look upon her as a friend until at last they both discover to their fright that love has ousted friendship from their hearts he is forced by outside circumstances to confess his secret past and she forces herself by the strength of her love to open her skeletoncupboard to his view what is inside it would be unfair to disclose but it is well worth reading the book to find out the dramatic surprise reserved for the last few chapters is a surprisea thing which is rare miss broughtons characters are all alive and human though we think it would make for more enjoyable and fluent reading if she would boldly write  dont  shant etc instead of the oldfashioned forms  do not you shall not you the little sketch of the family who also share the hotel with the heroine is most refreshing and amusing the sudden drama and tragedy is so unexpected that it is not until one has read the last line of the last page that one can appreciate the full meaning of the title mr e m sneydkynnersleys heroine makes her debut as a mountain climber in the alps the book labours under the title of  a snails wooing seeing that the heroine met the snail in august for the very first time and that the aforesaid molluscous animal proposed to her in the september following we do not think that there is justice or even propriety in the title we suppose that in the mountains they have change tout cela be that as it may the heroine whose name though cordelia  might have been goneril or yerenhappuck is a delicious young girl bubbling over with enthusiasm and delight at seeing and doing new things the possessor of an angelic singing voice and guaranteed to cause a disturbance in the heart of the most ferocious bachelor she carries all before herguides experienced climbers edelweiss and mountains she writes the most breezy and amusing letters to a girl friend at home and at last in spite of the attentions of a priggish oxford don weds the snail who is a cheery matteroffact sportsman who thoroughly deserves her mr sneydkynnersley has written an admirable book the most fanatical climbers have charming and realistic descriptions of their beloved mountains and the toils and dangers to be endured bef ore bagging them to quote the authors phrase those who have no experience of the alps will assuredly find themselves longing to follow in the tracks of the snail and the heroine and capture for themselves the wonders and beauties peculiar to the vast snowclad peaks in switzerland the author is possessed of a keen sense of humour which he has not sought to repress and the pages of this delightful book team with the spirit of fun till laughter voiceless through excess waves mute appeal and sore above the midriffs deep distress for breath to laugh once more we do not desire to convey that our condition at every page was such as is described in kiplings  necessitarian  the book would be extremely painful if such were the casebut the author is so sudden and unexpected at times that we were compelled to give way the fourth heroine is madame la duchesse de chevreuse intriguerinchief to anne of austria wife of louis xiii of france a woman whose heart was bigger than her head who compelled the admiration and service of all who had the good fortune to come in contact with her a certain period of the life of an english gentlemanan enormous giant of a man who cares for nothing save physical adventure and who sleeps with his sword by his pillowwhich is bound up with her interests is the groundwork for an excellent quasihistorical novel of the stanleyweyman type the presence of the great cardinal looming in the background and incidentally drawn on the cover with the vacillations of louis and his brother throw up into strong relief the more or less pathetic figures of anne and the duchesse surrounded by their friends fighting against overwhelming odds scheming plotting and intriguing by day and night under the shadow of the bastillethe huge englishman quick of brain strong of arm and clever of sword finds the intrigues amusing and only requires to be attracted by the beautiful marie de rohan now duchesse de chevreuse to throw his lot in heart and soul with the losing side the story of his adventures and the share he has in the fight against richelieu make up mr humfrey jordans novel entitled  my lady of intrigue it is admirably constructed and the interest is sustained throughout we like the englishman for his blunt common sense and with him feel sympathy for the defeated woman the sketches of richelieu gaston the kings brother anne of austria and many other wellknown historical personages of less note are skilfully and interestingly drawn and the exciting and adventurous elements in the book are told with none of the flamboyant  word painting  and excess in which so many of the historical novelists indulge we do not know mr humfreyjordans name as the author of other novels and if this is his first attempt he is to be congratulated upon an excellent result,storie
B4583,['6727320'],  literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by

B5065,"['3278203', '9012838']",  lhovel lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its author has so far given us,storie

allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is

relates with some force the highland pride of a simple daughter of macdonald whose lowland lover is represented as likely to suffer socially by marriage with a rustic like herself in the latter as in

excursion beyond the kailyard with a moderate amount of success the stories from seven dials duckworth  co by edith ostlere are well invented and cleverly written but do not leave an effect of reality there is the usual brutal and sanguinary scene between women in which polly  scored her rivals face down halfadozen times with the iron hairpins in terrible ruts that gaped open half au inch deep   this sort of thing is overdone the men seem as a rule too sentimental and epigrammatic being shown in hours of domestioism and lovemaking without much hint of the prodigies of want and beggary which dickens found in seven dials the whole is effective rather than convincing we refuse to believe that  higher  is fairly represented by  ayer  in cockney dialect but wild spelling seems now a regular equipment of those who write about sordid streets of the fourteen stories contained in the collection entitled daughters of shem and other stories by samuel gordon greenberg  co there is not one that is weak or disappointing nearly all are tales of jewish life mostly in the western provinces of russia and tell the story of oppression and suffering from various points of view this is not however the predominant feature of the book there is throughout the volume a noticeable charm in the composition and in the method of describing character and scene which arises only from skill in writing the delineation of jewish domestic life is remarkable and the interest of the volume is well maintained throughout the first of the stories which gives the name to the collection occupies nearly a quarter of the whole book and it is a clever study of a subject which might well have occupied a separate volume with one exception the rest are on a much smaller scale but we can characterise all as having exceptional interest for the general reader as short stories go there is something above the average of interest in the collection entitled curios by richard marsh long they purport to narrate some of the adventures of t wo collectors of curiosities  and there is much to be learned of a certain meerschaum pipe a phonograph a boule cabinet an ikon a puzzle box a supposed great auks egg and the mysterious hand of a vanished lady we have read the stories that are respectively attached to these topics and find them very tolerable specimens of the storytellers art and they have the advantage of being written with taste and skill the only disadvantage that one may reasonably feel is that the subjects dealt with are hardly good enough for the care expended on them by the writer there are some

the author and indeed his effects throughout the book are of a facile and obvious order the most ambitious tales in the collection are afterwards and father jinks as regards the first we must admit that it makes a brazen appeal to the emotions the very bravado of its unnaturalness and improbability has a superficial air of artistic courage but not only does the importunate noise of it render it futile it fails in another way  the hero though ian maclaren does not seem to think so is an unredeemed cad with whom one cannot for an instant sympathise we fancy that  father jinks  was meant to be specially impressive to our mind it suffers from a clumsy arrangement and the culminating pathos is decidedly dragged in by the heels the book displays an aptitude for the short story form and an outlook upon the world which is wide and tolerant but rather selfconsciously so it does not however represent ian maclaren adequately,storie

keats according to though legend that he wrote at the age of twentyfour the biblical drama of  joseph and his brethren two years earlier he had published anonymously a little book  stories after nature now for the first time reprinted from the excessively rare original stories and play passed without notice and wells abandoned literatureat all events published nothing more and after living first in wales then at quimper in brittany he settled at marseilles where he died at the age of seventynine it was only by the hazard of though secondhand bookstall that wellss two volumes were eventually recoveredthe stories by mr w j linton who has written a rambling preface for the present reprint the play by rossetti who showed it to mr swinburne mr meredith and others of his friends all of whom tried in vain to find a publisher for so forgotten a poet in 1876 joseph and his brethren was reprinted with an enthusiastic introduction by mr swinburne not till last year was a publisher found for the  stories after nature and mr bullen who has learnedly edited many reprints in his time has wisely limited the edition to four hundred for the  stories after nature full of delicate grace of romantic charm as they are cannot be compared as literature with joseph and his brethren that drama is not a good drama but it is a really great dramatic poem mr swinburne went so far as to draw a comparison between the character of shakespeares cleopatra and the character of potiphars wife in wellss play it is not however so much in characterization as in language that wells may be said to attain to something of shakspearean strength and savour but it is with the verse of shakespeare in his earlier period that we must compare the slow marchmovement of the verse in joseph and his brethren the prose style of the  stories after nature is in its own fashion similarly archaic but with the archaism of a particular period that was not to our present way of thinking over happy in its return to the antique every period has its idea its ideal of the archaic today it is mr william morris who sets us the pattern and undoubtedly it is a pattern woven with learned skill and a nice sense of the art of speech the archaism affected by wells was somewhat after the fashion of leigh hunt and might be described as an attempt to combine the style of the  decameron with the style of the most metaphorical among the elizabethans the mixture is somewhat singular sometimes effective not always acceptable the touches of elizabethan colour are at times mere violent incongruities they are at times curiously impressive bright grandeur disarrayed is a phrase that might have done honour to  joseph and his brethren and it is of a passage in that play the lines beginning  for household murder is a household rat that wc are reminded in reading  aye but household murders are dangerous things  they tell tales  they speak out after long being dumb  fifty years is not the date of their bond they haunt thc place and then men dream of it wells chose from  hamlet as the motto for his book the line which declares that to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand the choice was a happy one for the tales with all their rouge and frippery of form breathe a singularly clear and upright morality and are rich in examples of noble manhood and gracious womanhood it is in this sense that they may be said to be done  after nature for they have certainly little enough of the semblance of ordinary reality generally healthy in idea they have at the same time something morbid in their refining upon sentiment their insistence upon the qualities of delicacy linc feeling and the like their feminine or not quite manly fopperies of phrase a playground of delicate fancies a perfumed growth of hothouse flowers these stories recall in another art though pictures of simeon solomon exquisite exotic unreal with a certain immaturity in design a certain weakness in execution but with the morbid loveliness of the artificial it is not likely that the book will ever take a place in english literature certainly not such a place as that occupied by  joseph and his brethren but it will be remembered let us hope with other curiosities  it will bo opened from time to time by those who are critical enough not to be too critical of the immature and for these there will always be a certain charm in the quaintlynamed narratives of christian and his companions or patriotism and liberty of edmund and edward or the two friendsto name but two out of many  but it was enough for him to hear even the music of freedom and liberty at a distance as it were singing in the wind how finely that is said and it could be said too of the writer and to take another and last quotation there is something of distinction something of fine effect in so representative a passage as this   when gustavus had recovered his voice he said firmly and in a manly tone  ye neither of you know me that i am so mean in the opinions of my honourable companions is much very much  but that i am iso mean in my own is more i am mad to think of what i have lost i am glad that i am overtaken in my crime be it known to you lord frederick that in some senses you are the poorest of the two  for you are proud to wrench from humanity that which i loathe and shall throw by i know not why but i feel you are out of my memory i regret not to leave you and hardly seem to have done you an offence but to the greater and gentle christian what can i say  never enoughnever half i feel

B6241,['4994564'],  fallacy of ghosts dreams and omens with stories of witchcraft life in death and i monomania by charles ollier au thor of  ferrers c london 1848 ollier ti i s is the antipodes of mrs crow es night side of nature airs crowe approaches her subject with a conviction that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and with so much faith in spiritual appearances as amounts to an admission that  there is something in it and an endeavour to treat the matter philosophically mr oilier sets himself to the task with a predetermination to negative the conclusion and with intent to disprove the assertions of those whom he terms the credulous it must be admitted that mr oilier is clever and smart and if ghosts are to be written down his pen will do it he not only collects all the established arguments against the supposed communications of the spiritual with the material world but he puts them in the most telling shape and where argument is wanting he is prompt with fun which is perhaps even more effective with the general public who prefer the pleasure of a laugh to the labour of thought now there can be no doubt that very few ghoststories will bear close examination and the fact is undeniable that a ghost never a ppears to the sceptical and healthy even the instances collected by mrs crowe are not satisfactory it is impossible for a cautious man to accept the 6xistence of ghosts as a fact upon any evideace yet adduced we do not venture a step beyond this we cannot dogmatically assert our unbelief because no plausible reason is or can be assigned why there should not be communing between the world of spirit and the world of flesh on the contrary the presumption would be not only that it is possible but probable that is to say such will be the conclusion of those who admit the extence of spirit and acknowledge a future state the only question is if it has been estbiehed as a fact and to that we must reply in the words of the scotch verdict not proven it is otherwise with dreams second eight presentiments and such like of these there is abundant evidmce as matters of fact and the difficulty lies in accounting for them by any other means than reference to agency which is usually called supernatural but which would be more properly termed abnormal because it is not a violation of any natural law but the operation of an existing law that is called into action only in certain conditions of mind and body the attempts to explain away these prophetic promptings of the soul by the easy assertion that they are accidental coincidences will not bear a moments reflection such coincidences cannot be accidental according to any known calculation of probabilities there is infinity to one against them and they occur too often and with too many persons and under circumstances too remarkable to be answered by reference to chance but what is chance  nothing more than the result of laws which we have not taken into our calculation in truth there is no such thing as chance every event is the necessary consequence of certain fixed laws and might be predicated with certainty if we had the capacity to grasp and trace them if then the coincidences in question are the result of fixed laws have we a right to assume that there is no meaning in them that the author of nature i affixed to them no purpose and that we are to treat them with disregard and contempt would it not be more philosophical to investigate them carefully with intent to ascertain if the soul have not even while in this its tenement of clay the power under certain conditions of the body to which it is linked of communicating with the spirit world and of obtaining by a kind of intuition knowledge which cannot be procured through the circumscribed media of the bodily senses and that this knowledge it is but how obtained we cannot tell which we term presentiment second sight dreams and which it perplexes us to account for because we have no memory of the circumstances under which it was obtained  it appears to us that this is the philosophical view of the question which has occupied so many pens pro and con and in this manner we should like to have seen it treated by mr ollier who has skill in writing to make philosophy popular we note as an instance of the sort of grtuitous assumption with which mr oilier has sought to explain away facts his account of the murder at dundry which was discovered by too persons having dreamed on the same night that the body was deposited in a certain well and mr oilier assumes that there can be little doubt that the general opinion among the deceaseds servants wvas that their master was murdered now this is a pure supposition and the fact was otherwise we were present at the trial and made very particular inquiry into the circumstances from the witnesses and the truth was that up to the time of finding the body in the well at the earnest entreaty of the men who had dreamed that it was concealed there not the slightest suspicion of murder had been entertained by any person in the family or out of it it was supposed that the farmer had either killed himself or died in a fit therefore it was that nobody thought it worth while to examine a dry well covered by a huge stone which it required two men to lift hence there was not in the minds of the dreamers anything that could have led their sleeping thoughts to the well besides if they had suspected murder why did not the well suggest itself to their waking thoughts when actually on the premises searching and it was before their eyes  it is at least an extraordinary fact that two persons should have chanced to have the same dream in itself a marvellous accident on the same night such combinations of accident would be more wonderful than the fact itself and more hard to believe than the explanation which we confess presents itself to our mind i as that which is the rationale of this and all  other revelations of the same kind namely that the state of mind and body which in mesmerism calls forth that faculty of perception beyond the range of the senses which we term clairvoyance exists also in certain other states of body and mind that one of the conditions under which this species of perception occurs is thati the attention should be intensely fixed upon the object that in the case under consideration there was the condition of attention fixed upon the object namely the missing farmer that in sleep the state of mind and body occurred wvhich permits of perception by other than the media of the bodily senses and then the object vas perceived by the sleepers and remembered by them as a dream it is a phenomenon every day witnessed in persons in a state of mesmerism and there is no reason why the faculty should not be developed in other states wve have little doubt indeed that when the subject comes to be investigated by a series of close observations it will be found that this faculty which is called clairvoyanee is possessed by nal of us but developed only in certain states of mind or body more frequently however than we at present ha ve any suspicion of we are not sure that many of the thoughts and much of the knowledge we possess is not obtained by means of this facultynay we are inclined to believe that all of that mysterious intelligence which we term instinct is to be traced to the same source but this is too large a subject to enter upon here for the present we close mr olliers book having derived from it much amusement and with a hope that lie will be induced to look more profoundly into the subject and employ his great abilities to its elucidation rather than to an endeavour to laugh it down the papers collected in this volume originally appeared in ainsworths m1agazine and that will account for their somewhat gossiping tone,storie
B1981,"['8978427', '6893476', '8968197']",  the bet and other stories by anton tchekhov translated by s koteliansky f and j m murry   modern russian library maunsel  co 3 od net this volume of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may not recognise the reference to griboyedovs4 gorye ot uma on p 41 as 4 the sorrows of knowledge the title of the english translation of this famous play is 4 the misfortune of being clever  the kiss and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in

have made the short story their own by this i mean that in whatever other fields of literature they have distinguished themselves they made their arrival and maintain their position by means of the short story if not the most distinguished of this group mr bates is the most universalowing little to chekhov and maupassant and adapting almost all varieties of existence to his original pen here he is as versatile as ever as independent and as human and his genius for the indirect narrative begun in  the two sisters is brought to a fine technique moreover the author gives us glimpses of a new batesone who by means of striking comparisons in characterisation and the dexterous use of background throws up into the daylight points in the story which a less skilful writer would have allowed to become merged in the general background of shadow hitherto as in  the days end  and  the fallow land  both in some ways superior to this work we have only had hints of this remarkable technique but here it comes forth in a full and conscious embodiment  the water fall  the brothers  the lily and  the woman who had imagination  itself are all fair examples of this particular type of portraiture there is however less fire in this volume than in mr batess earlier work and i missed the unconscious beauty the passionate inevitability and economical austerity of  the days end possibly too his refusal to be governed by any one school has resulted in the domination of too many minor influences in a small space there are tastes here of boccaccio henry james flaubert pushkin lawrence and david garnettall those who while possessing few conscious disciples have made the short story in europe what it is nevertheless these are but tastes and when such pieces have been digested we are left with a arger taste in our mindsthe technique of an author whose inspiration is original ashley sownm  selected fiction the woman who had imagina tion by h e bates caps 7s 6d winner take nothing by ernest hemingway cape 7s 6d there is the repetition which is the search for perfection and the repetition which means that a writer has found a formula it strikes me that both mr bates and mr hemingway who in differing ways are masters of the short story have reached the danger point they are marking time and one begins to notice the defects of their qualities the accumulated sound of stories already written has clouded their ears mr batess rapturous and pervasive calm is becoming a set dullness we note and are irked by his close limitations and mr hemingways laconic naturalism is disintegrating and petering out into catalogues of perfunctory reporting such declines are of course the fate of shortstory writers owing to the exhausting difficulties of the form and however severe the criticism it is a necessary act of gratitude to remember that even at their weakest the masters of this difficult art stand head and shoulders above the average level anyone who had not read messrs bates and hemingway before would recognise at once their individual quality mr batess gift is a poetic sensibility in beautiful equilibrium and its world is the world of feeling in bud flower and fruition he writes of this only in its elemental forms of fear and love and in the course of every story one of these feelings is brought either out of darkness into bud or out of bud into flower and fulfilment even his disasters and deaths are seen in a sense as fulfiments there are two kinds of figures those modelled round and full and those carved down by the refinements of time to an ideal and waxen emaciation there is no atrophy no essential evil no corrosion of the mind the vessels of emotion are always ideally full and mr bates excels in bringing to consciousness a world of sensibility recognised by us but never so well defined but the mind is left out and when this liquid gift is used too much his work thickens andas always with the idealbecomes tasteless and dull one tyres in the end of his too milky madonnas his too slender children his too silent men his visionary young ladies it becomes monotonous to regard them as vessels of feeling only blended with no other experience putting aside his holidays with the quaintwhich are escapes from his real problemhis surest path of development lies in my opinion in that more mature side of his art which is at present at its best in descriptions of the simple incidents of domestic life and in which he gets effects which may be compared with the work of the dutch painters his ideal visions need to retire into that domesticity which his quiet slow art portrays with such satisfaction it is dangerous to dogmatize on the value of a writers influences but i think mr bates not at his best when obviously trying to penetrate into the dark passionate world which was peculiar to the work of d h lawrence mr batess hatreds always seem to be borrowed as with the woman who had imagination mr hemingways book has many excellent passages though the book as a whole disappoints it contains nothing as good as  the killers  for example  fathers and sons  and  a way youll never be a curious study in shellshockare good stories the rest show what a dangerously borderline method mr hemingways kind of naturalism is sometimes it enables him to get close to the skin of sensations at other times it is little more than a sketchy commentary his dialogue depends upon immense eliminations as well as upon close fidelity to the spoken word in fact he relies for his effects more on the suggested and unspokenor that which cannot be spokenthan is at first apparent now this suggestion must be definite and calculated building up a strong invisible pattern which must increase the potency of the spoken words otherwise they will be merely realistic weary futile vague they will drop into perfunctory reporting the excellence of the killers and of the indian part of  fathers and sons  is in the drilled definiteness of suggestion the banality of such pieces as  homage to switzerland  is due to the fact that it suggests nothing at all there is a subtle difference between a personal sense of the emptiness of the world and that

northern italy in a poetical fantastical experiment which is only audacious not blasphemous of course for most excellent reasons it ought to be a failure but in one or two directions it confounds the rightminded critic for it revivifies a page of old venetian life and it is a delightful bit of imaginative writing in force and reality however it must give way before the exquisite tragicomedy of the beggar women in  for ten francs one of the two great successes of the book perhaps at venice cannot compete with that one in familiar human interest yet i venture to think the highwater mark of the book is reached in the narrative of the old gondolier once employed in his youth by an austrian officer to row two prisoners to their death at the back of san georgio in most hands it would have been a mere picturesque description here it is a little drama concentrating into its few pages the venetian struggle gathering up the profound mystery of the venetian night giving too by the way the gondolier philosophers excellent summary for and against the powers that were and the powers that be  men walked the streets of venice with the cold fear of the white prisons and the hot fear of the white army lying heavy upon their mouths so that no man spoke of it at allno not even to his brother and when there was talk that man vanished   now we are all italians they tell me   we are all alike

the soul comes to the surface and the careful watcher may discern in the meagre spectre the never realised notion after which its creator fashioned it george fleming is this careful watcher she knows how to qapture the moment she is cunning to unveil it her method reminds one more than a little of m marcel prevost i select a contemporary it is the reverie of a woman upon what had not passed six y ears before upon the day when by way of a final indulgence of an unlawful passion she had given her lover a fareweeu rendezvous that meeting never took place of  they had been prevented by the commonest the most obvious of accidents it had simply rained all day long she had so vehemently persuaded herself that the very completeness of the sacrificethe manner in which she sent him away for evercould propitiate fate cheat justice turn this last poor selfindulgence into a mere question of compensation for the pain they suffered and then it had rained all day we look into the womans mind

successful treatment of the short story we have been shown the intimate leaves of the carnst or of familiar correspondence she arrives at the station for stonehenge so runs the story which she tells herself for the hundredth time and finds him awaiting her in the lumbering hired carriage he was by her side  his love was there  and in an instant a feeling of absolute satisfaction the rest the contentment of a natural completion filled all her heart and being stilled it filled it rising rising like water in a lock that trick by the way of doubling a word either to give a sustained effect or for intensity is throughout the volume overindulged they send the carriage away and lunch  and then    she told him the whole story rapidly impetuously without stopping to pick words as if some secret barrier between their minds were for the first time broken  i was twentytwo nearly twentythree and there were so many of us at home i was so pleased not to wait to be the first of all to marry  i liked all the things he gave me roger nownowat the present momenti like having those things still  but this was not all that held her when she was most nearly softened recurred the knowledge that   sometime somewhere there would come a certain day a certain hour when he ceased sic to care for her as he cared now  and nothing could prevent itnothing it was not even his fault  as they neared the terminus he made a laqt appeal and as he knelt   she laid her other hand upon his bowed head what was there left to say  she loved this man with all the force of which she was capable but she had grown up in a society which discourages sentiment and holds many material satisfactions for those who are successful after its own fashion her husband fusses in upon the finish of the vision the impression is of a little nature fenced into the strait path of social sanction by no principle of religion or of ethics but by its essential defects of courage and confidence subject therefore to

B3555,"['6795336', '9232252', '6796300']",  fiction montes the matador and other stories by frank harris grant richards 6s the author of elder conklin employs in all his fiction the device of what we would call  simple narration a device used by balzac and turgenev but not we think by any other great european novelist of the nineteenth century not even strangely enough by de maupassant the user of this device may be deemed to adopt the following attitude toward his reader   see here i have some very curious and interesting facts to tell you and i will relate them straightforwardly without embroidery and with only such explanations and descriptions as are absolutely necessary i merely want you to get hold of the facts indeed you must listen to them because they have interested me tremendously and i am sure they will interest you whatever you do dont mistake me for a romancer a concocter of stories now just listen and i wont waste your time  there now wasnt that worth hearing  true  of course it is true that is why i wished you to hear it such an attitude and such a method employed with skill and discretion are enormously effective in the way of vraisemblance and vraisemblance is esteemed by novelists the highest quality of narrative art it isntno one ever imagined that paradise lost was truebut that is another and a larger question there are five stories in mr harriss volumetwo rather slight and unequal to the three larger onesand each leaves you with the impression that the events told did actually occur the best tale is the first one the lovestory of an old espada told like most of the others in the first person it is a sinister and powerful recital and the bullfighting lore comes out of the mouth of old montes in a very natural and convincing manner  profit and loss  is a tale of kansas citymr harriss cosmopolitanism amounts almost to an affectationand the theme is an arson committed by an employee at the instigation of his employer the reward being the latters daughter the analysis of the criminals feelings after the crime is one of the best things in the book  he realised that all efforts were in vain that nothing could check the fire that his work was done completely and then remorse came upon him at first with a vague sense of loss nuch as one feels in missing the familiar and accustomed later with the full understanding of waste and destruction as acutely keen regret    the last story  sonia is russian and very obviously it has been composed at the feet of ivan turgenev mr harris could not have gone to a better master but nevertheless sonia is only a clever imitation the episode of the assassination of alexander ii is here used with singular dramatic effect the book as a whole is capable but mr harriss careless way of writing english will prevent him from taking so high a place as he might otherwise have occupied  montes thc matador aud other stories short storiei by frank harris g richardsthere are two excellent stories in this book the first and though one called first love a confession  montes the matador is tiie story of a great matadors love and hate but it is chiefly remarkable for the wonderful descriptions of bullfighting which occur in it mr harris not only must havo seen and enjoyed the sport but he makes his readers see it enter into though spirit of it and admire the excitement the wonderful escapes and the combined daring and skill of good bulllighters whether cspada banderillo or ehulo as a dramatic description of the great spanish tport by a lover of it this could not lie bettered she sordid aspect and the cruelty are left out of sightbut that is right for the matador who tells the story would not see them  he sees only the glorious excitement and the art of it ho even reveals a sort of love for the bulls whom he kills which comes from his intimate knowlodge of their character and their differences the story too which he tellshot passionate and cruelseems to flt exactly with the atmosphere to which it belongs in its way this tale is perfect tliero is not a jarring touch in it it is simply a bit of spanish life  first love is good also though it does not seem so inevitable as the first story lt is the description of the calflove of a very young girl for a quite ordinary young man to whom she attaches all manner of heroic qualities she linds that she can attract him against his will but knowing that ho does not love her she goes away and delilerately kills her passion he meets her years afterwards when he is prosperously married hears the story from her and is sorry at what he missed the conscientious vulgarity and stupidity of the young man on the stock exchange are admirably indicated in his own jmrrative of though events mr harris by the way shows great skill in allowing the unimaginative young englishman honourable but terribly commonplace to reveal himself unconsciously in describing his love affairs it is just the same type of man this time a budding mp who plays the second rule in the last story  sonia his ijewildorment and almost unwilling attraction on meeting a young woman ol unconventional ideas are very well suggested by his falling in love with her chiefly because she is a mystery to him and his very evident though shamefaced relief when he leaves her to consort with his correct young friends in the diplomatic service nevertheless sonia herself is not quite convincing and still less is though hero of profit and loss this is an otherwise delightful study in irony but it is spoilt by our inability to believe that david tryon would ever really have committed the crime he is here represented to have perpetrated altogether it is a book which proves mr harris to be in the first rank ot shortstory

B6446,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it

madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold

tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness

B2130,['8954680'],  literature chinese stories by robert k douglas c with illustrations blackwood  sons this amusingly illustrated volume reflects no little credit upon all concerned in its production and ought to achieve a marked success at this season of the year in it prof douglas shows himself to possess in a high degreeand not the less because a professorthe art of telling stories even chinese stories so as to make them interesting though lacking almost all the elements of the sensational fiction of nineteenth century europe not that there is no such sensational literature in china there is plenty of it and scarcely any example of that form of composition known to the west surpasses in variety of intrigue adventure and slaughter the celebrated historical novel the  san kwo chi or history of the three kingdoms a production of the thirteenth century of which the scene is laid in the troublous times that followed the fall of the han dynasty in the early part of the third century but as prof douglas remarks in his interesting and instructive preface  chinamen look upon war as an uncultured accomplishment and while 44 with us as with all aryan nations a gallant soldier is the popular herowith the chinese it is not bo military prowess does not attract the applause of the people in their eyes a man is a model hero who takes the highest degree at the examinations and quotes the classics with the greatest fluency he it is who clothed with virtue as a garment marries the heroine in the last chapterof such a hero the love is alwajs successful in the endamid the plaudits of high and low of these  social novels a typical example is sir john daviss translation of the 4 hao chiu chuen known as the fortunate union the hero of which mr  iron is inflexibly good and phenomenally clever from beginning to end one must however be an enthusiastic sinologue to read through works of this kind few of which have the merit of brevity and all of which moreover tend to produce in the mind of the ordinary reader an intense hatred of virtue with the shorter stories or novelettes of which so many collections exist in china the case is otherwise these are fortunately almost beneath the contempt of literary folk and are in consequence comparatively free from the bonds of chinese classicism they do reflect in some measure the varieties of chinese life and at least let us know what the chinese really enjoy for after all the worship of confucius is practised at a considerable distance and even among celestials the wisdom of mencius is provocative rather of yawns than of amusement there is more imagination in them than the chinese are usually credited with their critics forgetting the extent to which the natural genius of the people is fettered by tradition by literary conventionalism and by the difficulties of scripts and dialects where that genius has had fair playas in the selection of sites for temples and groves in architecture and decoration in art up at least to the destruction of the mings in choice of colour and design and in many other ways familiar to an observant resident among themno inconsiderable share of the aesthetic faculty both creative and appreciative is seen to be the heritage of the sons of han although for the reasons above indicated it scarcely reveals itself in those portions of their literature that much too exclusively form the subject of western studies nor are the chinese by any means altogether destitute of a sense of humour for tile most part their fun is broad farce often not of a very delicate character but that they are quite capable of the finer suggestion of the laughable under a grave exterior is sufficiently proved by the story quoted by prof douglas of the man whose more than noachian existence was put an end to by the curiosity of his seventysecond wife to each human being at his birth the great king of hades allots a page of the register of the underworld and when the page is filled up with the record of the mans career he is called upor rather downfor judgment on one occasion the king noticing that the volume wanted repair tore a leaf out of it wherewith to mend the binding the man whose leaf it was thus overlooked lived on and on till he attained the age of nine hundred and sixtytwo when his seventysecond wife died and on appearing before the judgement seat inquired as to the cause of her husbands longevity which had often perplexed her this led to the discovery of the error that had been made and of course to the summary ending of changs days the wellknown tale of i a fickle widow one of the best in the present volume is another instance of this quality of humour chwang the happy husband of a third wife the lady tien and a great student of the ancient philosophy from time to time retired to the hills to meditate upon the works of the sages of old on one of these occasions he came across a freshly made grave by the side of which sat a young widow busily fanning the new mound he begged to know the reason of this strange conduct and the widow informed him that she was under a promise not to many again until the earth above her late husbands grave should be dry hence the fanning a labour in which chwang gallantly offered to share the offer was accepted and chwang was rewarded by smiles and by a gift of the fan he had so deftly wielded on hit return home his contemplative mood excited the curiosity of the lady tien to whom he confessed the whole story her indignation was boundless   if fate were to decree you were to die it would not be a question of three years or of five years for never so long as life lasted would i dream of a second marriage how the ladys fidelity was tested and what were the dire results prof douglas has told far more amusingly than we can and to his pages we must refer the reader a more ambitious and in some respects more essentially chinese story is the one that follows entitled 4 a chinese girl graduate it turns upon the adventures of a young lady who dons male attire and as a consequence finds herself eventually in the perplexing position of being simultaneously engaged to another girl and to two men how she got into this coil and how she got out of it and all parties were eventually made happy is told with a good deal of humour and despite the literary dressing to which all these stories have been subjecteda necessity for those to whom through lack of familiarity with chinese customs and habits of thought much of the original would be without point or meaninga pretty quaint air of celestialism is thrown over the narrative and in reading it faint faroff memories come back born over long tracts of space and time of bamboo groves waving under sunny skies of singsong speech and wandering whiffs of the sandalwood and camphor of the far east of the remaining tales the story of  a matrimonial fraud and that of  a twicemarried couple are perhaps the best the verses that close the volume are less attractive not through any defect on the part of the translator but because the whole beauty of chinese poetry vanishes in though process of translation the  kinkukikwan from which some of the stories are taken is a repertory in forty volumes compiled under the ming dynasty the storytellers so commonly met with in chinese streets take their materials mostly from this work some of the tales have been translated into russian german french and english see  the casket of gems by dr s birch and they are all well worth translation as examples of the kind of literature the natural chinaman really loves though illustrations are largely imitative of chinese drawings and many of them are successful enough in others to the eyes of a purist the female faces are not sufficiently chinese in character on the whole prof douglas has produced a charming book which younger folk may read with pleasure and older people without any of that disappointment which the perusal of oriental versions often produces,storie

genuine union and how the rate and taxcollectors had weekly meetings at the  greyhound and told stories based on their personal experiences we must leave the reader to find out for himself we shall only inform him that the stories so told are five in number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds

adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number

fashion common with christmas books and is a concretion of small stories embedded in one large mass a christmas party is assembled at an old eliabethan mansion on the welsh borders and as the younger

the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course

christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the garrulous old lodging housekeeper bear mar s of the hand which gave us mrs gamp and mr micawber we may particularise the scene between majorjackman and the taxgatherer i i i i i i i i ii which as a piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle

giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on

dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that gorgeouslycovered and cleverlyillustrated magazine london society has also issued an extra christmas number containing no less than fourteen stories and poems we cannot say much for the merit of the

B844,['8856324'],  riddn the devil and other stories short stories by louis becke fisher unwin  mr becke is a real artist his stories are almost commonplace as far as incident goes but he has the gift of touching off a character or a scene so that they appear as familiar to the reader as his own most intimate surroundings as usual in mr beckes books the stories are all about the pacific islands and nothing seems omitted to make the life on these islands vivid the trader and his temporary wife the buccaneering shipowner the savages and even the animal life are all described with a masters touch it is difficult in such a wealth of good stories to pick out one which will dwell in the memory longest  whether it be those about that casual ruffian denison or that of the little savage boy who saved the irish powdermonkey or the tragedy of the white wife and the brown  woman  but perhaps the most thrilling and impressive description is that of the homeric fight between the killers and their cousins the blubber whales we know not how far mrs walfords the little legacy and other stories pearson are fresh for one or two seem to awake remembrance but they are all happily enough devised and readable dealing with modern society and modern domesticity  and it should be an attraction to healthyminded people that all the little dramas end happily the author finds her materials by the wayside and her wit keeps the roadway  but it is much to extract romance from  whiteleys and to evoke the most honourable side of a girls nature by an incident at golf on the whole these genial trifles should be successful the dominion of dreams a collection of stories by fiona macleod constable  co is in some respects the most considerable work yet issued by the writer who has been for several years the protagonist of the scottish gael marking how completely she has steeped herself in the sagas and mabinogion and most perhaps in the ancient poems or fragments known as ossianic one might have said that here is the translator for whom the revived cult of the old northern world has waited but miss macleod is better than a translator translation is wholly inadequate to reproduce the flavour the accordance of sense and sound in the language which set an early example of assonance and rhyme and free prose paraphrase with themes borrowed amplified and occasionally modernised from ancient sgeidachdan and seandain gives a truer impression of the ore which really underlies the heaps of verbal material which repel the novice also the writers method enables her to bring down to the present time her pictures of life and thought in the remote corners where the gael survive not that it must be supposed that the average highlander or islesman occupied still with the struggle for existence though not as of old with perpetual strife against mortal foes has leisure to speculate on natural beauty but he still turns in long winter nights and times of rest to traditions of an earlier day and his thoughts are cast in the forms of a poetic and highly figurative tongue this remarkable book in spite of an occasional falsetto note and some careless gaelic mairi ban  for mairi bhan  sheumais  for seumas muirnean for mhuimein cbreathes throughout the celtic spirit in its moods of mournfulness of halfsuperstitious awe of impassioned and stately utterance it falls into three parts the first consisting of what may be called modern stories of incident one4 the herdsman being an expanded and modified version of the hebridean part of the story in green fire  the white heron  is similarly a sort of corollary of 4 pharais but most of the tales are printed for the first time one of the most characteristic is 4 by the yellow moonrock here we may note that a touch of humour of which there is not a trace in these pages any more than in macphersons ossian though oisin himself unbends sufficiently would have saved the gallant piper from so equivocal an end in the second group abstractions prevail of these pieces  in the shadow of the hills takes the palm for pathos and beauty the last part consists of adaptations from the old myths they are excellently handled though some of their savagery and simplicity is lost in the process the style of the author is everywhere distinguished what she requires to put herself in touch with a world which is practical as well as literary is some relief where there is a tendency to the  phosphorescence of emotion to quote her own words  a little expansion of such treasures of humour as gaeldom possesses  more definite localization as a rule  and generally an avoidance of monotony stately though it be the best writing we have yet seen from mr w s maugham is contained in a volume of short stories entitled orientations fisher unwin they are six in number and with two exceptions differ from each other widely in subject while the matter of one of them bears some resemblance to the writers novel4 liza of lambeth if another entitled de amicitia suggests a somewhat youthful hand it will be found none the less interesting while in one called 4daisy he boldly brings fortune and happiness to a young lady who runs away with a married man the writers handicraft is however more interesting and original than the subjects he has chosen for his stories in an imaginative narration he is seen at his best and it contains a good passage which we should quote but for its length this little collection of stories gives rise to the hope that the author will arrive at a larger measure of success than his two previous volumes of fiction have achieved the critic who reads the last page of the bearers of the burden by major w p drury lawrence  bullen will find that several of the stories of which it is composed have already appeared in a volume published last year by messrs simpkin marshal  co and entitled the tadpole of an archangel and that the rest of the collection is reprinted from various  service  periodicals the note in which this information is conveyed is dated from hms camperdown mediterranean march 1899 before arriving at this intimation we found that several of the stories were familiar to us the writer is an officer of the royal marines and has considerable talent for the telling of short stories all are written with much discretion and the collection is above the average of such things marcheurs et marcheiises by  richard omonroy published by calraann levy is mostly composed of what french admirers of the author would style clever  little infamies and the general nature of these stories of parisian civil life is as naughty as the authors former stories of regimental life we should not have thought it necessary to name the volume but that it includes one of the most touching pieces of sentiment we have met with and one written in admirable style very different expectations will be formed by readers who begin at the beginning of the volume and by readers who adopt the popular practice of beginning at the end for as the sentimental romance comes last a sentimental reader beginning there may be tempted to turn back to other stories not one of which is of a similar kind,storie

london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the thief in consequence of his too grasping stipulation loses both eyes falls into a well and is drowned nos 3139 give in a readable form a number of the stories about raja rasalu

B5645,"['2491258', '3239214']",  short stories dunky fitlow by a e coppard cape 7s 6d among contemporary writers of the short story there are few whose work has been so consistently exciting and disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it

writers who realising that the short story is the twentieth centurys most individual contribution to literature have schooled their genius to this highly disciplinary form the modern short storyas witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with fiery sharpness in fifty pages the author can give a degree of reality to the lives of his characters which many novelists never achieve in four hundred but the best story in the book is  the small lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed to stand alone   sally go round the moon  is a long short story by a young writer whose work has for some time been attracting the discriminating few mr batess special forte is stories in a delicately lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the exercise of just that lyric power which is his special contribution to the art of the modern short story,storie

test of any verse translation from a foreign poet must be the possibility of giving pleasure to those ignorant of the original we cannot think that the two latest volumes of the translation of heine will satisfy the test mr heinemann has been unfortunate in the death of charles godfrey leland and of the author of the rendering of  the book of songs  before the sheets went through the press but the fact cannot be denied that the english of the last named volume is not musical and in almost every case is not poetry the  new poems by margaret armour mirs wv b macdougall is better and many of the points have been very cleverly reproduced but in this volume too there are weaknesses of rhythm and from it alone it would be difficult for an englishman to credit the high position heine has

translated by t brooksbank  vol x new poems translated by margaret armour heinemann the translation of heines prose by the late charles godfrey leland has long been xecognized as a sound piece of work on the whole though it is marred by some careless renderings due to a casual study of the german it would be worth while we think to revise it and it is a matter for regret that leland did not live to translate the poems also after an interval of several years that task has been entrusted to others and we at last see this handsome edition of heines works in english drawing near to its completion for the resolution he has shown in carrying out his original plan under difficulties mr heinemann deserves all praise heine the poet heine is of course one pf the most hopeless of tasks for the translator he has that quality of the volkelied which trembles on the ludicrous and vulgar with effective naivete he is sentimental and satirical in a breath diabolically clever with a saving touch of the homeliness which is genuinely german and by no means english sie haben heut abend gesellschaft is this the same in english and is there any adequate english for it  we think not and even talented imitators of heine such as w e henley suffer when they try to transplant the flower of his genius henley writes i took a hansom on tonight which is frankly a failure and indeed the number of absolute successes scored in this perilously attractive field is by no means  large as for the translator in the stricter sense of the term he is in a still more desperate plight for he must cling to the elusive german while striving at the same time to fly freely on his own pinions no wonder then if his movements are frequently a trifle awkward not to say ridiculous of the two volumes now before us that for which miss armour is responsible is in every way superior to the other it is indeed noticeable that feminine talent has often shown itself to advantage in the forlorn attempt at rendering heines verse into english and may claim a large proportion of the few triumphs hitherto achieved certainly we cannot speak very favourably of mr brooksbanks work he does not possess the lyric gift so that his translations lack spontaneity and freshness his literary sense is hardly delicate enough to be trusted by itself and as he is not always scrupulous in following his original the result is at times painful to a reader who knows his heine and not particularly pleasurable to one who does not moreover he is often astonishingly careless we are told in a publishers note that he did not live to revise the volume but with all due allowance for that some of the renderings strike us as strangely inaccurate turning for instance to the fourth poem in the  north sea cycle we find the second line es gurt das meer represented by  wide yawns the sea and the sixth  wien storr iger griesgram der gut gelaunt wird by like a peevish old grumbler an old acquaintance a change which of course utterly spoils the sense presumably mr brooksbank must through some mental confusion have read  gaunt and gekannt in place of giirt and gelaunt but that is scarcely an excuse now and then indeed we come across passages in which the german has clearly not been understood as for example in the last line of the burleque sonnet  dann mussich diirsten oder ich musspumpen which is turned i must perish of thirst or to the pump for drink be going miss armours volume which contains the new poems and  atta troll is much more satisfactory she has something of the genuine lyric spirit writes easily manages her rhymes skilfully and altogether shows a decided gift for translation her versions are almost always good and occasionally excellent and perhaps we are not justified in asking more from a translator who foregoes the right of selecting isolated poems according to personal fancy sometimes she might with advantage keep a little more closely to the original and bear in mind that heine did not choose his epithets at random but no doubt it is easier to find fault with the translators of such a poet than to make allowances for the enormous difficulties with which they have to contend and it is only fair to acknowledge that miss armours work as a whole is much above the average we may permit ourselves the pleasure of quoting a short poem as a sample of it your lying promise of delight

process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public interests were not so absorbing as personal talk and home side stones c w boase,storie

B6960,"['6694702', '8821645', '8589110']",  commonplace and other short storle by christina g rossetti f s ellis covent garden i870 before speaking of  commonplace it may be as well to say what is necessary of the other short stories  which make up the volume  the lost titian  is an excellent outoftheway tale for a magazine  vannas twins is a nursery idyll pretty with a touch of pietism  a safe investment  is a really impressive tract upon almsgiving  pros and cons  is a dull tract on free and open churches the waves of this troublesome world is a tract upon anglicanism and methodism rather poetical and even humorous but decidedly provincial commonplace fortunately occupies half the volume and has a permanent artistic value which places it above many books which are probably much cleverer and certainly much more amusing the situation on which the story is founded resembles the situation in mistress and maid by the author of john halifax sufficiently to make it worth while to compare them in both we have three maiden sisters and foresee that the two youngest are to marry and the eldest not in both the youngest is selfish and exacting and sells herself for what luxury and position a vulgar nouveau rich can give the author of john haltax is dreadfully in earnest about it all and the heartsearchings of her three heroines seem to her laden with the weight of the universe if it is not the same to us the fault is in the coldness of our hearts not in the interest of her story now from all this exaggeration and ambition miss rossetti is wholly free she is aware that after all she has only got hold of an ordinary subject and that all that can be done for it is to treat it with accurate delicacy and simplicity there are people in the book with amusing peculiarities but their peculiarities do not eat them up we notice them in passing just as we should in real life dr tyke with his ready but not witty wit makes us ask whether he is really amusing or tiresome just as we should ask if we met him at a dinner miss drum the retired schoolmistress with her favourite specific of juicy mutton and her parting benediction to her french teacher to love her husband and love her mutton  is a type worthy of mrs gaskell the pomp of the parvenu is made interesting or at least tolerable by being left for his bride elect to mimic and her motive for selling herself is ingeniously imaginedby an accident she is left dependent upon her sisters and she prefers to quarter herself upon an husband her little manoeuvres to secure him by outshining his daughter are interesting because natural and the fluctuations of the second sisters tame but genuine qshaire de swur are gracefully narrated but the real value of the book is in the kind quiet cynicism which miss rossetti sees so clearly is the only right way to look at most of our lives which she feels are only important so far as some of us may go to heaven and some by a yet rarer possibility may be of a little use on earth g a simcox  commonplace and other short stories by christina g rossetti ellis miss rossettis volume of tales appears most opportunely many of the readers of lothair are at this time longing for some more homely fiction with which to refresh their jaded faculties after the perusal of mr disraelis somewhat tawdry romance to all such persons we recommend commonplace nothing could be more striking than the contrast while  lothair abounds in startling incidents to which mr disraeli in vain attempts to give an air of reality by frequent allusion to the events of the day and to the personal characteristics of individuals miss rossetti contrives out of the most ordinary incidents of commonplace life to produce a realistic fiction more absorbing in its interest than any sensational novel commonplace the first and longest of the stories included in this volume is in our opinion the best the plot is simple enough at a quiet wateringplace called bromptononsea lived three maiden sisters named charlmont at the opening of the tale catherine the eldest is in her thirtyfirst year of a kindly and unselfish disposition she is somewhat prim and oldmaidish in her ways having for many years had the sole charge of her younger sisters lucy not yet thirty has two years before formed an unrequited attachment for the handsome shallow mr hartley whom she had met when visiting her cousin dr tyke jane the youngest and handsomest of the three is vain and frivolous eager to escape from her quiet home and to enjoy the dissipations of society at the outset of the story the two elder sisters are contemplating a visit to their london friends dr and mrs tyke but lucy hearing of the marriage of mr hartley whose unmeaning attentions she had misconceived and whom she fears to meet prevails upon catherine to take jane instead of herself as her companion at dr tykes house jane makes acquaintance with mr hartleys fatherinlaw the purseproud and ostentatious mr durham who falls in love with her good looks makes an offer and is accepted the hartleys are present at the marriage and lucy at last realises the shallowness of mr hartleys character and recovers her peace of mind this change of feeling leaves her free to appreciate the worth of an old admirer mr tresham who now renews his attentions and is in due time accepted it will be perceived that this plot is anything but new the characters and the circumstances in which they are shown are alike commonplace and yet the story is anything but dull the personages are lifelike and interesting the incidents are natural the humour is delicate from the first page to the last the whole tale is remarkable for a peculiar finish and grace both of treatment and of style it is impossible that quotations should do justice to a work thus totus teres atque rotundus still one or two extracts will suffice to prove that our praise is not undeserved the following passage will be intelligible without the context jane having gained her point recovered her good humour and lost no time in exposing the deficiencies of her wardrobe sister she said smiling her prettiest and most coaxing smile you cant think how poor i am and how few clothes ive got catherine trying to appear serenely unconscious of the drift of this speech replied  let us look over your wardrobe dear and we will bring it into order lucy will help i know and we can have miss smith to work here too if necessary oh dear no  cried jane   there ia no looking over what does not exist if it comes to furbishing up old tags and rags here i stay why youre as rich as jews you and lucy and could give me five pounds a piece without ever missing it and not so much of a gift either for tm sure poor papa would never have left me such a beggar if he had known about mejane is a posthumous childthis argument had been used more than once before catherine looked hurt lucy said  you should remember that you have exactly the same allowance for dress and pocketmoney that we have ourselves and we both make it do of course retorted jane with latent spitefulness  and when im as old and wise as you two i may manage as well but at present it is different besides if i spend most on dress you spend most on books and music and dress is a great deal more amusing and if i dressed like an old fright i should like to know whod look at me you dont want me to be another old maid i suppose  the following is a capital bit of simple realistic description  bromptononsea possessed only one hotel of any pretensions the dukes head so designated in memory of that solitary royal duke who had once made a brief sojourn beneath its roof he found it a simple inn bearing the name and sign of  the three mermaids the mermaids appearing in paint as young persons with yellow hair and combe and faces of a type which failed to account for their uninterrupted belfogling in handmirrors tails were shadowily indicated beneath waves of deepest blue after the august visit this signboard was superseded by one representing the duke as a gentleman of suave aspect pointing towards nothing discoverable and this work of art in its turn gave place to a simple inscription the dukes head hotel perhaps we shall best indicate our high estimate of the story by saying that it reminds us of mrs gaskells  cranford without being a servile imitation of that admirable novel the story which ranks next after  commonplace in merit vannas twins recalls to us the manner of miss thackeray it is even slighter than commonplace in its plot but there is the same finish and delicacy of execution we are informed in the preface that pros and cons and the waves of this troublesome world were written each with a special objecta fact which seems to account for their being of inferior merit the remaining stories are too manifestly designed to point a moral to be worthy of very high praise the book as a whole is sufficient to establish miss rossettis claim to a place in the list of successful female writers of fiction we sincerely hope that it will not be long before she produces another volume of tales in the same style  commonplace and other short stories by christina g rossetti f s ellis the story which gives the title to the volume before us is so excessively commonplace that it requiresa great deal of patience in the reader to get through it it is a tale of three sisters one of whom marries for money another for love while the eldest does not marry at all we are at a loss to understand why the author should care to risk her fame by publishing so weak and vapid a story we are indeed told in the prefatory note that while  the earliest of these tales dates back to 1852 the latest was finished in 1870 a lapse of years sufficient to account for modifications of tone and style certainly the fact does account for the differences of tone and style but it does not explain why we are treated to a mere juvenile effusion which was certainly not worth printing as  pros and cons and  the waves of this troublesome world  were written each with a special object we will not judge them as under other circumstances we might be tempted to do perhaps the best story in the volume is the lost titian and its greatest fault is its brevity here is a picture of a picture a description of the masterpiece of the great painter  the orange drapery was perfect in its fruitlike intensity of hue  each vineleaf was curved each tendril twisted as if fauned by the soft south wind  the sunshine brooded drowsily upon every dell and swelling upland but a tenfold drowsiness slept in the cedar shadows look a moment and those cymbals must clash that panther bound forward  draw nearer and the songs of those ripe winy lips must become audible and here is titians studio elegant with clusters of flowers sumptuous with crimson goldbordered hangings and luxurious with cushions and perfumes from the walls peeped pictured fruit and fmitlike faces between the curtains and in the corners gleamed moonlighttinted statues  whilst on the easel reposed the beauty of the evening overhung by budding boughs and illuminated by au alabaster lamp burning scented oil strewn about the apartment lay musical instruments and packs of cards on the table were silver dishes filled with leaves and choice fruits wonderful vessels of venetian glass containing rare wines and iced waters  and footless goblets which allowed the guest no choice but to drain his bumper we regret to say that the story is not founded on fact as the author informs us that che is not conversant with any tradition which points to the existence of a lost picture by the great master of the remaining stories hero  and  vannas twins are by far the best and are worth reading once at all

amusing volumes upon the public with irresistible energy indicative we sincerely hope of renewed health wre think that lu general to doctrinate with tales of fiction upon any of the various passions that agitate for good or evil the human breast is very prejudicial to moral science the poetic mind may well truly and beautifully illustrate them in all their workings but it is one thing to paint elegantly and forcibly another to treat of thc mind and its various imperfections scientifically and satisfactorily the  lutherans  is written with the avowed purpose to prove that the most besotted bigotry wrapped up in insane pride aud stained with innocent blood is not inconsistent with nay may spring from motives altogether pure and virtuousin fact written to correct a mistake of the authors entertained in his young and generous days  that malice was an essential ingredient of bigotry  for he adds  i now think that it bigotry may be a very honest habit with which pride and egotism have much more to do than the acrid quality malice 1 had once supposed all this may be true but a tale is not the kind of argument to prove it our idea of an act of cruelty is that there is malice in whatever rejoices in the pain of others or conspires to bring about such enjoyment we well know that an auto da fe was more sought for and enjoyed in the palmy days of the inquisition than all the ferocious pleasures of the bullfight but we must not ourselves begin to be didactic when we get mr gaits works before us they always afford us so much for reflection and generally for admiration that we are apt to be tempted into prolixity putting aside the doctrine of the  lutherans we proceed to inform the reader that the tale is excellent the different phases of passion are extremely well described and the interest is actually absorbing were it condensed into five acts it would form an excellent drama the language when the occasion requires the expression of emotion is energetic to a startling degree this tale occupies the half of three volumes and it well deserves the space  the dean of guild the next story in succession is a burlesque clumsy and at the same time droll and humorousa sort of elderly peter simple he the dean takes his ignorance his scotch selfinterestedness and his tomfoolery into the presence of the three greatest characters of the day the duke of wellington earl grey and lord brougham with admirable tumhommie yet upon the whole the thing somehow clashes upon our sense of propriety  and the tory hankering not that we dislike the tories seems to twist the sketch into something like ungainliness there is a coveit attempt to make the same tories the possessors of all that is magnanimous in feeling and elegant and fashionable in taste how much better we should like mr galt if he would write upon the broad principles of human nature and not upon those of a subjected party  the black pirate  is a failure on that point we are dictatorial if we cannot expunge it from the book we will endeavour to do it from our memories  and the  greenwich pensioner  is really a maimed object post captains dont take apprentices that have not served their time out of ships and make them captains of thc faretop upon stepping on board  this objection may be looked upon as technical yet there is not the fresh smell of the sea upon the narrative lt may please the shore going folks with a touch here and there of the elegant in writing but it wont do  with the sailors the  lombards  is a sketch simply descriptive and necessary to be read by all those

a pleasant flowergarden ns the space occupied hythe jaunt the  craniologists  is a fearful tale and tends very much to subvert thc very conclusions that mr galt wishes to draw from it whether man be an agent or au instrument onlythough it is really un awful consideration in morals aud religionis of no consequence in social policy  for if one mau has the organ of destructiveness so fully developed that his murders are the inevitable consequences of his formation aud ho is no longer a free agent so the organs of caution are equally expanded in the rest of society aud they will as inevitably hang

agreeable acquaintance we have found it the book deserves a better title the stories are no more stories of the field of waterloo so exhausted of interest than the canterbury tales are tales of the city of canterbury the storytellers are soldiers but the subjects are not professional they belong to human life generally indeed the great merit of the work consists in showing what we will call the plainclothes side of the military character the careless soldier has his story of sentiment and sorrow the gay devilmaycare fellow has a memory stored with thoughts of tenderness and the boldest breast confesses the keenest sensibilities withal there is no maudlin all is manly and what it becomes men to feel and to say they feel a generosity of sentiment runs throughout which gives a cordial zest to a volume of great entertainment the reader feels that he is amused with a thing of the right grain  stories of watrloo and other tatu in 8 vots post 8vo the vivacity pleasantry and polish of

elegant voluptuary we have had occasion to notice this subject of military books before and we shall not repeat our observations we have therefore only to say that the interest which desdemona expressed for the heroic acts of othello applies to these delightful volumes the plays of shakspeare especially please because there is an uncommon variety in the characters andincidents and the reflections and sentiments are quotations from life a book which every body has read now these volumes are written upon the same shakspearian principles of variety of character and natural circumstances exhibited veluti ix speculo la other words these tales are plays or tragedy melodrame comedy and farcethe battle of waterloo and other public events forming the scenery processions and similar grand stageaccompaniinents the taste of the author is of the first character for as a gentleman and man of the world he never preaches or rails nor does he go beyond dry humour except in the story of colonel wilson i 302 306 where he expresses abhorrence at the roguery andblasphemy of certain tartuffes and cantwells who had made of a baronets seat a publichouse for all sionbound

the things he seeks and the beauty of whatever he burdens himself with in returning nor can any muse even though she lie as untiring as mr morriss remain for ever in midair and it is well when the creative brain satisfies itself in its moments of repose with the contemplation of the great works of past times instead of frittering away its powers on the barren and unfamiliar pursuits of metaphysics or politics besides writing his epic poem of the lovers of gvdrun a work for forcible simplicity breadth of purpose and even serenity of power almost unequalled in the literature of our time mr morris has twice already combined with mr magnusson in rendering the best icelandic sagas which remained untranslated into english presenting ns first with the  grettissaga next with the story of the volsungs and xiblungs he follows this time with six short sagas the most important being the three first the  gunniaugnsaga the  friopjdfssaga and the  viglundarsaga and the others being smaller tales of varied interest and weight the treasure of the book is its first story it is difficult to understand how a poem so exquisite as the tale of gunnlaug the wormtongue and raven the skald has eluded the attention of translators so long especially during this present generation when so much notice is being paid on all sides to the language and literature of the north it is true that the bare outline of the story has been made known to englishmen notably in messrs cox and hunters tales of the teutonic lands published three years ago but now for the first time we have the saga rendered word for word it is one of those works for which any rendering less exact than this is wretchedly inadequate it claims admiration for a rounded and finished form a passionate perfection of style a fullness of detail without an iota of triviality or thinness which distinguish it above all its fellows without the grandeur of  njiila the romantic verve of  grettis the fullness of humanity of that laxdaela  which we can only hope mr morris may yet find time to render for us the  gunnlaug  has a concise picturesqueness a purely artistic perfection which place it at least as high as these perhaps higher a delicate critic has pointed out how far removed  les pensees douces les reveries  of this saga are from the rough manners and fierce emotions of most of the icelandic romances and those who are less eager for tenderness in poetry than the excellent m choiocki may yet allow themselves to be subdued by the subtle and exquisite perfume of love that breathes from this faultless saga the strong young poet with his goodly lightred hair his lovesome countenance and masterful mind whose tongue is so shrewd and bitter that it bites men like a snake is contrasted with the stately and gentle helga meek and maidenly in all her ways so bathed in the glory of her gold hair that gunnlaug calls her face a sweet field islanded in seaflame for all their passion and all its fitness they never win more than brief words together before all men save that once when gunnlaug spoke with helga in thorkels hall and gave her the fairest of things the cloak ethelreds gift then when both the men who loved her were dead slain on the moor of dingness by one anothers hands helga meekly marries the man she cannot love  but with a final touch of genius that completes the poem we are told how when she came to die resting her dying head against her husbands knees she had the cloak of gunnlaugs gift sent for and after gazing at it awhile sank back into her husbands arms and died dutiful to the last true to her pledges true also to her love mr magnusson for though best reasons doubtless alters slightly the dates of the story the birth of gunnlaug has been quoted as belonging to the year 988 the present volume places it five years earlier and the dato of his death too in 1008 instead of 1015 these are details of minor importance but in one matter mr magnusson seems to be incorrect on his own showing since he makes gunnlaug twentythreo years of age at his death whereas by the internal evidence of the saga he must have been twentyfive or twentysix the oldest ms which is known attributes this work to ari frofci the great skald to whom we owe the first draught of the landndmabok and one of the most famous of icelanders he died at a great age in 1148 and therefore if this attribution can be relied on about a century elapsed between the occurrence of the events and their narration there seems good reason to believe that the persons mentioned really existed and that the adventures described in great part at least really happened the chief characters in this saga are mentioned elsewherein landndma in the egilssaga and in the edda of snorre for exampleand both gunnlaug and hrafh raven are mentioned in the list of the most eminent skalds preserved in the upsala ms of the younger edda some of though incidents as for instance that exquisitely humorous one of king sigtrygg silkybeard in dublin who has never had a song made in his honour before and who does not know what it would be etiquette to offer gunnlaug for his bear a stamp of truth about them while others may well be the pure creation of the wonderful genius who evolved and arranged them if that genius was indeed ari then ari ought to be named in honour among the great worldpoets in frithiof we at once pass into the domain of a more limited and less powerful imagination full of strong and lovely passages as it is it is not put together with an art so masterly as to retain and subdue the memory with the spell of firstrate work the gift of the author seems to lie in his ability to present certain scenes with intense vividness before the inner eye he does so notably in describing ingibiorgs bowers in baldurs meads in the splendid passage about the storm in the burning of baldurs temple by frithiof the three passages that enthral the imagination most and satisfy it best it is considered wholly mythical in character  it seems pretty certain that it was written in iceland about the year 1300 and no account of its principal personae is found in any older saga certain critics have maintained that frithiof was a genuine historical personage but others and among them more especially p a munch have strongly contested this view that historian mentions it as one of the few purely romantic works of the imagination which the early literature of scandinavia has preserved and avers that it contains absolute historical and geographical absurdities munchs strictures are very minute and stringent the most important of them are that at the time that frithiof is supposed to have lived no norse vikings had yet come to orkney and so that frithiof s finding of angantyr settled as earl in those islands is obviously a myth  and again that it is incredible that any kings of sogn and of ringerike can have waged war with one another by land or sea  but these arguments have been met by nystrom and other swedish critics and the matter remains uncertain the story of viglund the fair is far inferior in interest and ability to its two predecessors with all deference to mr magnussons learning and mr morriss taste we feel doubtful whether they were justified in occupying so much time and space with a saga so late and so poor as this it has a certain outward resemblance to njala which it palpably imitates in various points but it is infinitely beneath it in regard of merit it is one of the skroksogur or fabulous sagas and the very name expresses a kind of scorn of it as a bastardgrowth upon a nobler stock the  viglundarsaga  is understood to be inelegant and unclassical in language its oldest mss belong to the fifteenth century and its date of composition cannot possibly be put earlier than the end of the fourteenth passages have been pointed out which prove its author to have been familiar with the frithiof and with another of the slcroksogur the  barsarsaga the best parts of the work are the passages in verse which bear marks of an earlier and a far more gifted hand vigfiisson whose copenhagen edition of 1860 remains the standard one considers the best of the staves to date from the close of the thirteenth centurytwo hundred years therefore before the bulk of the saga we would take this opportunity of pointing out how especially beautiful are mr morriss versions of these short poems it seems to us that he has excelled most of all in the  viglundar  the staves in the  gunnlaug  are often so extremely obscure that they hardly present any idea to the mind when literally translated the determination of the icelandic poets not to call a spade a spade if there was anything in heaven or earth that it could be called besides makes their fancy difficult to follow here for instance is a beautifully worded but very elaborate way of saying that none but the brave deserve the fair   ho who brand of battle beareth overwary never love shall let him hold the linenfolded for wo when wo were younger in many a way were playing on the outward nesses from golden land outstanding of the remaining three stories the best is that of  roi the fool a certain franklin is so nnfortunate that all men call him roi the fool but after bearing many affronts he proves himself shrewd enough at last and baulks his enemies as shylock was duped henceforward ho is called roi the wise this is a version of an oriental story found in the thousand and one nights and elsewhere the story of  hogni and hedinn is amplified from a tale in the treatise of poetic diction called sk aid sharp armal and in an appendix the authors give a version of this earlier original finally is added the short saga of  thorstein staffsmitten the son of thorarin it is to be hoped that all lovers of literature will turn to these pages in which mr morris has enshrined the grand legends of our forefathers in the crystal of his pure simple and idiomatic english edmund w gosse  three northern love stories three yorth rn love stories and other tales translated from the icelandic by kirikr magnusson and william morris london  elli and white this lxok arrives at an appropriate moment coming not in the stir and stress of fashionable life but when  the season is over and the tired and jaded dwellers in town streets are beginning to look forward wistfully to the restful green of far valleys or the shining grey lines of the sea ave cannot imagine any companion more appropriate for a holiday solitude than this as always in mr morriss poetry the present with its noise squalor and fatigue is forgotten and the past alone is conjured up softened by distance harmonised by reverie endeared by regret while we seem invited to witness a dreamy drama of old times annoyed by no discomfort of body or mind but stretched at ease on some open breezy place full of salt air and thy my perfume the scenery is that with which we are already so familiar from thc great epic of thc  lovers of gudrun a poem that scarcely gained that full meed of special admiration that was its due from being buried in the mass of the earthly paradise all beautiful but not all so strong as this the sweep of air over the liberal downs the dark tarns open to the sky the fantastic and sinuous outline of creek and firth the grey and changeful sea so mystical and melancholy the background of broken rock and fiery peak these constitute the scene of those icelandic poems of which  gudrun is the greatest modern example in that noble work mr morris strayed far enough from the antique original to claim all the honours of creation but of these last sagas he is only the translator yet whether it be that his own genius is intimately akin to that of the old icelandic poets or whether it be that english so rarely delicate and pure as his clothes the stories with a style not essential to them the fact is clear that these versions bear on their face an unmistakable morris character a sentiment of sadness as subtle and intangible as a shadow or an odour a grave delight in antique manliness that is almost greek in its intensity a strong worship of the sea that is wholly northern in its stately and confident passion and that underlying never forgotten conviction that life is a passing thing and the labour of it vain the best of the sagas here translated is said to have been written by ari a skald who died in 1148 if we suppose that the date of its composition was the year 1100 we find iceland capable of producing a poem of the most faultless artistic preciousness and finish two centuries before dante had written the  divina commedia and more than three before the birth of chaucer the first dawning voice of modern european literature was outsung by these dwellers in a sterile and arctic island ari died before avalther von der vogelveide was born and the icelandic literature received in its dying arms the infant body of romance poetry the oldest existing version of the story of  tristram and iseult is found in a very late saga ms now at christiania when the saga of gunnlaug avormtongue with its elaborate lyrical passages and all its cultivation of style was being composed the porphyrogene emperors of the east still reigned unmenaced in constantinople the first crusade had just proved successful against jerusalem and strangest of all the moors were still unshaken in granada and in zaragoza ave usually consider that modern literature grew out of the fullness of the middle ages is the icelandic then a literature that had risen to its height before the middle ages set in to be counted as modern or ancient  the first and most beautiful of the three principal sagas in mr morriss new book is that of gunnlaug the avormtongue and raven the skald gunnlaug is a strong young poet redhaired goodly agile and hardy as quick with a sword as with a stanza and so shrewd of his tongue that all men are afraid to come under his satire he falls in love with the gentlest of goldhaired mayshelga whose vast locks encircle her like a flame and who is as tender as she is passionate and the ideal of maidenly modesty gunnlaug is halfbetrothed to her but being too turbulent at home he is sent aviking for three years at the end of which time helga is to be bound to him no longer if he does not come he goes abroad serves ethelred of england and other stranger lords and cannot find his way back within the three summers helga remains true at heart but her folk are minded that she should wed raven a man of power and substance and a great enemy of gunnlaug as a rival poet be it added helga in her sweet submission despairing of her hope marries raven and while the wedding feast is being celebrated gunnlaug comes back mad with baffled love and fury then helga cannot endure raven and is so hard with him that out of very anguish of heart he is glad when gunnlaug challenges him to fight for that dishonour done him they find they cannot fight to death in icelandit is too civilised and populous so they sail away for norway in different ships and after many days find one another on a lonely ness and there fight on till both are slain helga at home is married to another man who treats her well but her heart is broken and one winter night she dies with gunnlaugs last gift in her hand the tale of frithiof is one which has been made extremely popular by the epic of the swedish bishop esias tegnera poem that has been translated some fourteen times into english and once at least into nearly every european language bnt tegners highly coloured and extremely sentimental romance bears little resemblance to the ancient saga that mr morris and mr magnusson have translated the frithiof of the swedish poet is a troubadour of the provencal order delicately sighing among nightingales and roses while odorous winds carry the sound of his guitar through such woods as scandinavia never saw the frithiof of the saga is a rough man of few words of strength and daring greater than a mortals and able to plead his cause successfully with angry adverse gods to give an idea of the character of this and the other stories we give part of a wonderfully splendid description of a storm and now when they were come far out into the main once more the sea waxed wondrous troubled and a storm arose with so great drift of snow that none might

tears over thee   said frithiof  surely that was in my mind therewith so great a sea broke over the bows that the water came in like the infalling of a river but it availed them much that the ship was

all interesting but for the sake of certain local associations which many will share with us we love the simple story of  the lost dahlia better perhaps than any of the rest the dear old abbey of reading which we never can look at or think of without being flooded with recollections of past times deserved this tender reverential tribute and we thank thee mary mitford from our heart of hearts for bestowing it with so bounteous a hand  the eye of many a one now in the distant corners of the earth but whose happy boyhood was passed in the shade of those mouldering timehonoured walls will not be a stranger to a tear in reading the  lost dahlia miss mitfords sketches of character in humble or rustie life have much of the truth without the gloom of that great mastercrabbe with her it is all nature but not  nature pictured too severely true she avoids the subjects which too much harrow up the mind and her gentle satire anel in a way she is a satirist of a high order is always softeneel and sweetened by her ineffable goodnature she never has the heart to dismiss the very worst of her personages without giving them some redeeming virtues this perhaps is being more true to nature than

B2301,"['8673249', '3171171']",  the mystery of edwin drood london saturday april 2 1s70 w  ir litebattjre u  ti by charles tl dickens with illustrations no i chapman  hall when the last chapters of richardsons  pamela appeared the readingclub at slough fell into a state of great excitement the story had come to that point at which the question of pamelas marriage or abandonment must be settled and when the readers found that the young lady after much tribulation was happily settled in life they rose in a body opened the churchdoors and rang a joyous peal of bells in honour of the wedding and of the pleasant termination of a very eventful tale at the commencement of another tale which is clearly intended to be also very eventful a feeling of a somewhat similar congratulatory tendency seems to have taken possession of the public they are glad to find a favourite author in a shape and fashion in which he has not been seen for many a weary day it is a positive pleasure to see once more the green cover in which the world first beheld mr pickwick and to find within it the opening chapters of a tale which gives promise of being worthy of the pen which sketched with masterly hand the course of mr pickwicks fortunes since that green cover saw the light and number 1 less happy circles of listeners have been held in thrall by a reader a generation has passed away to many people sam weller is as old as strap or partridge and the pickwick club as quaint and antiquated as humphrey clinker mr dickens in fact has had the privilege of delighting two generations and it is not often that one writer can turn the privilege to such graceful account as mr dickens has done as sir bulwer lytton if we may still use the name by which lord lytton will always be best known after a course of many years of incessant labour wrote novels as fresh and vigorous as  pelham which lifted him to fame and honour when he was but a very young man so mr dickens shows that more than thirty years of work have only strengthened his faculties and that if he be now a veteran in the service he has with wellapplied experience as much as he ever had of the muscle strength grace facility and frankness of youth this fact is manifest even within the first five chapters of  the mystery of edwin drood there are some of mr dickenss critics who have never been able to see in him anything but a caricaturist they are of the nature of those censurers of homer who would deny all merit in the odyssey because of the comic portions of that marvellous poem that there is exaggeration in mr dickenss early sketches and a good deal of exaggeration in details of character in pickwick cannot be denied but these defects disappear in the brilliancy and truthfulness with which other characters are portrayed in the younger weller for instance there is humour without a trace of vulgarity and rare character as he now seems to be there was many a  boots  of those days who were not unlike him in his sayings and doings he is not theatrically got up he is redolent of the place where we first met him and though the eccentricities of halfadozen sharp witted  bootses  of his time are concentrated in sam he is nevertheless one of the characters nearest to truth in all mr dickenss creations as for sams father he seems perhaps to modern perceptions a queerer monster than his son but the survivors from among the young readers of the authors earliest literary time can very well remember that there was not a road on which stagecoaches ran in connexion with london that could not furnish  whips  whose philosophy and general ways of thinking and acting were exactly akin to those of the elder mr weller who spelled his name  with a wee my lord spell it with a wee we should not have been disposed to blame mr dickens if his series of typical characters had been exhausted but this mystery already shows that this is not the case the series seems to be inexhaustible and the authors skill in portraiture as great as of old with perhaps more delicacy and daintiness of touch there is equal power and grace in the description of the localities which are to be the scenes of his drama but they are in fact not scenes in a theatrical sense but real spots in the world which the reader readily identifies although the places exist only in the imagination which the author helps him to form of them very few of his readers know anything whatever of such a scene as that with which the story opens or to which it serves the office of brief prologue but there is such reality about it that the place and its inmates become familiar this effect is even stronger in the description of the cathedral city of cloisterhaman actually existing locality under an assumed name in any case it would be for the reader a genuine cathedral city with all its belongings a tourist would just now have some trouble perhaps if book in hand he were to try to identify the edifice described with the cathedrals he might visit for the purpose at gloucester for example the scaffolding of the repairers completely hides the choir at bath the  restorers are in full possession of the nave while at wellswhich is the nearest of the three to the cloisterham of mr dickens the vertical and horizontal poles of the beautifiers puzzle spectators of the most elaborate and beautiful of west fronts be this cloisterham where it may there the story fairly begins and soon plunges into both serious and comic business including one of the most original of lovescenes in which two young people ever took part we are not going to enlighten our readers on circumstances which they will prefer to make out for themselves we may however notice how in some of the descriptions mr dickens preserves certain of his wellknown agreeable mannerisms there is a certain complacent dean who does not walk across the close to his repast but directs his comely gaiters towards the ruddy diningroom of the snug old redbrick house where he is at present in residence with mrs dean and miss dean again the melodiously good minor canon the reverend septimus crisparkle does not leave a room like ordinary mortals but he withdraws his amiable face from the doorway and conveys it down stairs there is moreover a touch of the old boz humour in that exquisitely promising rosa bud who says to her equally promising affianced lover at the makingup after a little difference such as lovers vex and amuse themselves with no i cant kiss you because ive got an acidulated drop in my mouth in another way we are reminded of the old humour in the boy deputy who remarks of a drunkard whom he is cruelly flinging stones at as the latter leans helplessly against a wall he gives me a apenny to pelt him home if i ketches him out too late and this is not denied by the tippler who states that by giving the boy an object he enables him to earn threepence a week but touches like these are less characteristic of the artist than his power of wordpainting here is a little picture of the cathedral and the close which may remind some of killcanon corner when the wind and rain are beating pitilessly about it at wells not only is the day waning but the year the low sun is fiery and yet cold behind the monastery ruin and the virginia creeper on the cathedral wall has showered half its deepred leaves down on the pavement there has been rain this afternoon and a wintery shudder goes among the little pools on the cracked uneven flagstones and through the giant elmtrees as they shed a gust of tears their fallen leaves lie strewn thickly about some of these leaves in a timid rush seesanctuary within the low arched cathedral door but two men coming out resist them and cast them forth again with their feet this done one of the two locks the door with a goodly key and the other flits away with a folio music book the city itself is thus described in the authors picturesque fashion an ancient city cloisterham and no meet dwellingplace for any one with hankerings after the noisy world a monotonous silent city deriving an carthy flavour throughout from ito cathedral crypt and so abounding in vestiges of monastic graves that the cloisterham children grow small salad in the dust of abbots and abbesses and make dirtpies of nuns and friars while every ploughman in its outlying fields renders to once puissant lord treasurers archbishops bishops and suchlike the attention which the ogre in the storybook desired to render to his unbidden visitor and grinds their bones to make his bread a drowsy city cloisterham whose inhabitants seem to suppose with an inconsistency more strange than rare that all its changes lie behind it and that there are no more to come a queer moral to derive from antiquity yet older than any traceable antiquity so silent are the streets of cloisterham though prone to echo on the smallest provocation that of a summerday the sunblinds of its shops scarce dare to flap in the south wind while the sunbrowned tramps who pass along and stare quicken their limp a little that they may the sooner get beyond the confines of its oppressive respectability this is a feat not difficult of achievement seeing that the streets cf cloisterham city are little more than one narrow street by which you get into it and get out of it the rest being mostly disappointing yards with pumps in them and no thoroughfareexception made of the cathedralclose and a paved quaker settlement in colour and general conformation very like a quakeresss bonnet up in a shady corner in a word a city of another and a bygone time is cloisterham with its hoarse cathedral bell its hoarse rooks hovering about the cathedral tower its hoarser and less distinct rooks in the stalls far beneath fragments of old wall saints chapel chapterhouse convent and monastery have got incongruously or obstructively built into many of its houses and gardens much as kindred jumbled notions have become incorporated into many of its citizens minds all things in it are of the past even its single pawnbroker takes in no pledges nor has he for a long time but offers vainly an unredeemed stock for sale of which the costlier articles are dim and pale old watches apparently in a slow perspiration tarnished sugartongs wita ineffectual legs and odd volumes of dismal books the most abundant and the most agreeable evi dences of progressing life in cloisterham are the evidences of vegetable life in its many gardens even its drooping and despondent little theatre has its poor strip of garden receiving the foul fiend when he ducks from its stage into the infernal regions among scarlet beans or oystershells according to the season of the year the characters are etched as truthfully as the localities are painted we may all recognise miss twinkleton the lady governess of nuns house a  seminary for young ladies  miss twinkleton has two distinct and separate phases of being every night the moment the young ladies have retired to rest does miss twinkleton smarten up her curls a little brighten up her eyes a little and become a sprightlier miss twinkleton than the young ladies have ever seen every night at the same hour does miss twinkleton resume the topics of the previous night comprehending the tenderer scandal of cloisterham of which she has no knowledge whatever by day and references to a certain season at tunbridge wells airily called by miss twinkleton in this state of her existence  the wells notably the season wherein a certain finished gentleman compassionately called by miss twinkleton in this state of her existence  foolish mr porters revealed a homage of the heart whereof miss twinkleton in her scholastic state of existence is as ignorant as a granite pillar miss twinkletons companion in both states of existence and equally adaptable to either is one mrs tisher a deferential widow with a weak back a chronic sigh and a suppressed voice who looks after the young ladies wardrobes and leads them to infer that she has seen better days perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants handed down from race to race that the departed tisher waa a hairdresser in stronger lines still is drawn the portrait after life of a prominent man in cloisterham mr sapsea dresses at the dean has been bowed to for the dean in mistake has even been spoken to in the street as my lord under the impression that he was the bishop come down unexpectedly without his chaplain mr sapsea is very proud of this and of his voice and of his style he bas even in selling landed property tried the experiment of slightly intoning in his pulpit to make himself more like what he takes to be the genuine ecclesiastical article so in ending a sale by public auction mr sapsea finishes off with an air of bestowing a benediction on the assembled brokers which leaves the real deana modest and worthy gentlemanfar behind there is however a greater man than sapsea in cloisterhamthe cathedral mason and habitual toper but with humour and philosophy about him namely durdles who is broadly and vigorously limned  durdles is a stonemason chiefly in the gravestone tomb and monument way and wholly of their colour from head to foot no man is better known in cloisterham he is the chartered libertine of the place fame trumpets him a wonderful workmanwhich for aught that anybody knows he may be as he never works and a wonderful sotwhich everybody knows he is with the cathedral crypt he is better acquainted than any living authority it may even be than any dead one it is said that the intimacy of this acquaintance began in his habitually resorting to that secret place to lock out the cloisterham boypopulace and sleep off the fumes of liquor he having ready access to the cathedral as contractor for rough repairs be this as it may he does know much about it and in the demolition of impedimental fragments of wall buttress and pavement has seen strange sights he often speaks of himself in the third person perhaps being a little misty as to his own identity when be narrates perhaps impartially adopting the cloisterham nomenclature in reference to a character of acknowledged distinction thus he will say touching his strange sights durdles come upon the old chap in reference to a buried magnate of ancient time and high degree by striking right into the coffin with his pick the old chap gave durdles a look with his open eyes as much as to say is your name durdles why my man ive been waiting for you a devil of a time and then he turned to powder with a twofoot rule always in his pocket and a masons hammer all but always in his hand durdles goes continually sounding and tapping all about and about the cathedral and whenever he says to tope tope heres another old un in here tope announces it to the dean as an established discovery it is with reference to one of these ancient sleepers that mr durdles answers to a question put by jasper who is a principal character in the drama that is to be played out  theres a olden under the seventh pillar on the left as you go down the broken steps of the little underground chapel as formerly was i make him out so fur as ive made him out yet to be one of them old uns with a crook to judge from the size of the passages in the walls and of the steps and doors by which they come and went them crooks must have been a good deal in the way of the old uns two on em meeting promiscuous must have hitched one another by the mitre pretty often i should say without any endeavour to correct the literality of this opinion jasper surveys his companioncovered from head to foot with old mortar lime and stone gritas though he jasper were getting imbued with a romantic interest in his weird life yours is a curious existence without furnishing the least clue to the question whether he receives this as a compliment or as quite the reverse durdles gruffly answers  yours is another we leave the lovers to be studied by our readers they will find in them how a true artist can give novelty to an old theme and even give it altogether an original aspect the remarkable couple in this story are not a mere walking lady and gentleman but two people who immediately excite interest and with whom readers will be glad to meet often if these young folk be only as amusing and sympathystirring as they are here finally mr dickens has begun his new story in excellent vein a circumstance on which we may congratulate not only himself but the public generally  the mystery of edwin drood by thomas secconibe sir william robertson nicoll has broken 3out in a new place in the volume that he has just published on  the problem of edwin drood the first sentiment of many perhaps the majority of those who scan the title will be surely this subject might be allowed to take a longearned rest its place is in the mausoleum of literary curiosities along with speculations as to the dedication of shakespeares sonnets the authorship of the  eikon basilike or the identity of junius a large number of keen detective ninds have exercised themselves upon the problem as upon a sharpening strop most of them have written books or pamphlets on the subject and their lucubrations would fill a fairsized dwarf bookcase a few janatical dickensians may welcome any pretext for poring over the moiety of  edwin drood once more but the reader who does not take an active part in the dickensian fellowship may well regard with some coldness the appeal of a book which makes the reperusal of a fairly long and difficult though unfinished work a prior condition of complete understanding if the general reader is dissuaded by these prima facie considerations from the discussion of sir william nicolls latest work let us say at once that he will incur the risk of missing not only one of its authors most interesting productions but also one of the most considerable critical performances of recent years the books great achievement indeed is that it does not depend for its interest by any means exclusively upon the discovery of x in the matter of the specific solution of the edwin drood mystery the present deponent at any rate found an interest of no secondary kind in its pages as an investigation of the testimony as to all the circumstances attending the production of dickenss latest work it abounds in documentary evidence it reveals with singular suggestiveness the evolution of dickenss latest manner it brings us nearer  dickensthe last phase than any book we can remember to have read with mr lehmanns admirable book on  dickens as an editor  it goes far to vindicate the reality of national gratitude to the great novelist now in his hundredth year battered by life and worn by the many leagues of print which he had traversed dickens had indeed journeyed far from  pou sto  of  nicholas nickleby  and  oliver twist one may not be able to agree with the writer that  edwin drood  is one of the best of his works an analogy is employed between some elements in  drood  and in  hunted down the parallel is rather damning to the unfinished work of i87o  a more melodramatic theatrical and unsatisfactory short story than  hunted down  would be hard to discover among the works of the reprinted the bloom and the flush of dickenss wonderful morning had evaporated long before the day of  edwin drood his style had lost every scrap of that wonderful simplicity and eighteenth century rotundity so remarkable in his first great successes the marvel is that it should have acquired so many new qualities of distinction   the problem of edwin drood a study in the methods of dickens by sir w robertson nicoll 3a 6d net hodder  stoughton the opening passage in the second chapter df  edwi1 drood for instance is a far more elaborate piece of prose than dickens could have possibly imagined in his impressionable youth yet how bright that wonderful eve still is how little undimmed that marvellous vision and that amazingly vivid power of portrayal for sheer writing power in mere force of description how many authors are there of any age who can stand up against it  if a descriptive critic of today wants a new subject a terra incognita let him write about the early and undiscovered plots of dickens nobody marks them at the time of reading a propos of his inquiries here our author makes a few remarkable discoveries about them the plots of most of the novels indeed from  barnaby rudge  to  our mutual friend are fearful and wonderful things a monograph might be written we cannot asseverate that it would be read about each one of them but the plot of  edwin drood stands apart it seems from most if not all of them it is a thoroughly hlrid and melodramatic plot but it does possess a certain interest of its own and it does reflect a considerable amount of interest upon the characters for dickens this is a novelty with a vengeance  in most of his books the plot appears like some malignant parasite draining the life blood of the parent stem of character in  drood  the plot has an independent life of its own faith in wilkie collins which had germinated a dozen years ago had now born ripe fruit without professing in the least to be an expert on this thorny question i must say that sir williams solution seems to me eminently sane and satisfying in the first place it is extremely tentative and unaggressive in the second it is based broadly and munmistakably upon the irrefragable testimony of forster forster with all his faults remained to the very end dickenss chosen biographer and confidante the suggestion that the great man deliberately misled forster as to the general tendency of the tale is inadmissible forsters hints therefore must form the nucleus of anv really judicial summingup of the matter the first object of the bench is to cut away the tangled and luxuriant overgrowth of baseless theory when this is done and a few careful qualifications cautiously made it seems to me that we have a solution approximate enough for the purposes of any reasonable curiosity the testimony of the illustrator sir luke fildes so far as it goes is absolutely corroborative of the biographer everything points to the conclusion that the villain jasper tried to murder his nephew edwin by strangling him with a black scarf that dickens intended that the wicked uncle should have succeeded in his intention seems to me equally certain jasper had premeditated and rehearsed the murder in the opium den the motive was the fierce and wolfish passion for edwins betrothed this passion revealed finely in one of the original illustrations was cloaked by a most revolting duplicity jasper says our author was  an unredeemed vllin he was anything but a fool he drugged drood he strangled him he put his body in quicklime he had time to rob the victim of his jewellery but for one unknown recently acquired ring which was ultimately to prove the piece de convictioni he maintained a threatening and defiant attitude he had done his business w e are to imagine him working with a hydelike malevolence suggested by his ebullitions against the urchin deputy in a night of the wildest tempest he is a new type of villain rather for dickens and a far more successful one than the tvpicallv dickensian wholly incredible carker his passion too is a new element revealing a considerable change as it seems to us in dickenss moral perspective the gradual determination to criminal motives which set in only after the first efflorescence of his genius seems to arrive at its climax in the lurid plot of  edwin drood the theory that edwin after all was not dead and was to appear in the eleventh or twelfth part redivivus seems to me untenable there is no iota of evidence to support it and the only two pleas in its favour are first that it was rather contrary to dickenss method to destroy a  title  secondly the suggestion conveyed by the design at the foot of the original green wrapper our author is not at his happiest i think in his description and elucidation of these designs but he makes the essential point namely that they are not to be taken too closely or literally they are rude hieroglyphics and like zadkiels are to be interpreted with the eye of faith after taking immense pains to construct and conceal an elaborate mystery it was hardly likely that dickens was going to give it away on the cover as to the mode of death there seems to me no evading the express statement made by dickens to his illustrator that lie must have a long black scarf for edwin to be strangled  ith as regards jaspers ejaculations in the opium den look down look down too much imptortance need not be attached to them miss stoddarts suggestion on this point seems quite adequate the idea of flinging edwin from the tower may have occurred to jasper and been abandoned highly probable too is her speculation that the sapsea monument was to be the destination of the murdered mans remains jasper may have conveyed some quicklime into that spacious receptacle before depositing the body there there was ample opportunity for such operations in the midnight solitude of the precincts these outlines seem fairly meritable but the precise manner in which the discovery was to be worked out must remain dickenss secret the ring the opium woman princess puffer durdles datchery and the deputy and finally the suspicions of mr rewgrious were evidently to be the main instruments of conviction rewgious whose first appearance is so impossibly grotesque but who improves so steadily upon acquaintance was in my opinion to play a most conspicuous part tartar of course marries rosa and crisparkle helena neville it seems was to be spirited away probably killed in the act of bringing the  wicked man  to justice all this part of his thesis sir william appears to prove to our complete satisfaction far more than any of his predecessors he has gone into the question of manuscripts interlineations and erasures as he recapitulates these we cannot help repeating what is he going to make of all this  nothing however could be more satisfactory than the way in which every ounce of this evidence is made to fit into its place and to tell upon the volume and weight of the converging mass of proof this part of the book is an admirable illustration of the judicial method when it comes to the question of  who is datchery  the case is altered dickens left no clues here of an external kind everything depends upon the ingenuity of the commentators and much if not most of this ingenuity seems to us hopelessly misplaced nor can we wholly exempt sir william from this indictment his theory that datchery is helena is certainly one of the best and the best sustained it is far more plausible for instance than the incredible proposition that datchery is drood himself both suppositions seem to me to impugn the sanity of dickens as an artist our interpreter uses the erasures and interlineations here with an almost uncanny cleverness yet after all his exertions the case seems to us less than  not proven that an artist of dickenss calibre should be reduced to such a pitiable artifice as a maleimpersonator is to us a thing too painful to contemplate the explanation of datchery saying to himself be it remembered   i like the old tavern way of keeping scores  is a marvel of literary gymnastic but after all  it will not do i am inclined to think that datchery was a new character and an emissary of grewgious probably some sort of relation and no more he is a melodramatic figure at best that is enough without representing him as a young and beautiful woman masquerading as an amateur detective and consuming brown sherry and mutton chops  our author himself im inclined to think has a slight revulsion of feeling from the strain of such a conjecture at any rate he refers to it not at all in his concluding chapter which is a most admirable drawing together of the various lines of evidence conjecture and parallel in what will prove we are convinced to the multitude of readers one of the most repaying books on the subject of charles dickens that the century of his fame has yet produced,storie

night  toiling to leave a memory behind him failed in an aspiration which though not the noblest is still perhaps noble moreover it would be pleasant to think that all the affectionate solicitude of his friends to win for him the princes suffrages was not thrown away that stevenson had the kind of genius which manifests itself in a strong magnetic personality is made clear now that his voice is still by the loyalty of his friends would that the memory of certain other dead men we could namemen greater than he  had encountered the same loyalty  dead as living no writer surely has owed so much to the affection of friends as stevenson every writing man may be said to begin life well who has the good luck to be born north of the tweed scotchmen are sufficiently few in number to be legitimately clannish and they never fail to exercise their right second to his own fame every scot has the fame of every other scot at heart even carlyle gloried in the  waverley novels  until sir walter seemed to snub him when straightway he found them barren no doubt if this clannishness were resented in england matters would not run so smoothly with the writing scot but englishmen are too many to be clannish themselves and they take with a smile the quaint doings of the mutual admiration society beyond the tweed in london stevenson had at his feet a group of english pressmen who proclaimed him to be the great novelist of the agea sort of sublimated walter scott it was refreshing to hear them at first the cry was  scott and stevenson  at last it was  stevenson and scott yea the greatest imaginative writer that has appeared in great britain since shakespeare died was compared and to his disadvantage with a novelist whose characters already are fainting in the struggle for life for oven now within three years of his death the public writers seem to be able to remember only two  dr jekyll and mr hyde stevenson has style said these loving brothers of the pen  and remember that scott has none cobbett when prostrated by pessimistic thoughts about the future of the british constitution exclaimed  thank god we have a house of lords and in the same way did many a literary student when inclined to pessimistic misgivings about the lovely nature of the writing man exclaim  thank god we have stevenson and the savile club not even the sweetness of stevensons disposition could have saved him from friends like these had it not been for his stock of common sense of this sweetness of disposition and of this good sense we could quote many instances but let one suffice when  kidnapped appeared although in reviewing it we enjoyed the great pleasure of giving high praise to certain parts of that delightful narrative we refused to be scared by stevensons friends from making certain strictures it occurred to us that while some portions of the story were full of that organic detail of which scott was such a master and without which no really vital story can be told it was not so with certain othor parts from this we drew the conclusion that the book really consisted of two distinct parts two stories which stevenson had tried in vain to weld into one we surmised that the purely jacobite adventures of balfour and alan breck were written first and that then the writer anxious to win the suffrages of the general novelreader whose power is so great with byles the butcher looked about him for some story on the old lines that he experienced great difficulty in finding one ana that he was at last driven upon the old situation of the villain uncle plotting to make away with s  the nephew by kidnapping him and sending him off to the plantations the athenaum whose kindness towards all writers poets and prosemen great and small has won for it such an infinity of gratitude said this but in its usual kind and gentle way this aroused the wrath of the stevensonians yet we were not at all surprised to get from the author of kidnapped himself a charming letter from which the following sentences may be given   i wish to thank you for your notice of  kidnapped and that not because it was kind though for that also i valued it but in the same sense as i have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers  you who fight the good fight contending with stupidity and i would fain hope not all in vain  in my own case for instance surely not in vain what you say of the two parts in  kidnapped was felt by no one more painfully than by myself i began it partly as a lark partly as a potboiler  and suddenly it moved david and alan stepped out from the canvas and i found i was in another world but there was the cursed beginning and a cursed end must be appended and an old friend byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door so it had to go into the world one part as it does seem to me alive one part merely galvanised  no work only an essay for a man of tentative method and weak health and a scarcity of private means and not too much of that frugality which is the artists proper virtue the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden the days of professional literature very hard yet i do not so far deceive myself as to think i should change any character by changing my epoch the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves  and my  kidnapped  was doomed while still in the womb and while i was yet in the cradle to be the thing it is thoroughly characteristic of stevenson are these words and it is because of thisamiability of hisno less than on account of his talentsthat we sincerely hope he may leave that memory behind him which he toiled to leave and yet we tremble to think of the provoking way time has of making short work with novels for the fieldings scotts brontes thackerays dickenses and george eliots that survive think of the host whose very captains such as bulwer disraeli ainsworth g p r james wilkie collins trollope are half forgotten nor is the reason of this far to seek though it may not be exactly true that each generation demands to be represented by its own poet it seems that even in regard to poetry a live dog is better than a dead lion if his voice is attuned to the convolutions of the contemporary ear but it is largely true that in the widespreading valley of prose literature at the foot of parnassus each generation demands to be represented by its own novelists and turns away from all but the very few among the novelists of previous time for one great difference between a poem and a novel is undoubtedly this that a poem ho wsoever humble professes to be and is a work of art written primarily for the poets own delectation  offered indeed as a medium through which he would fain express that ego so dear to him but a novel howsoever full of literary qualities is primarily a manufacture for a marketa fact which scott frankly confronted though perhaps not quite so frankly as does the novelist of the present hour who improving even upon the advertising methods of the late illustrious author of  the mysteries of london instructs the interviewer or paragraphist in his or her employ to inform though world of the number of copies printed the rate of the royalty hisor her publisher allows per copy and the amount of the publishers chequedoes this as regularly as the directors of a jointstock business give their balancesheet to the world we have no quarrel with all this we merely state the fact that as patent soap mustard liver pills and novels are nowa days in the same category the manufacturers of these commodities must allow prince posterity to have his marketing done for himself we have been led to dwell at some length upon this subject through an embarrassing consciousness that what we are about to say upon stevensons work may vex and hurt those fervid and tooloving souls who as we have shown above are more stevensonian than stevenson himself let our excuse be that it is though aim of this journal and always has been to exercise a twofold function in criticism although its main business week by week has been to give an account and a brief criticism of the literature of the hour it has also aspired when occasion arose to take up a higher groundin a word it has aspired to deal with those laws of cause and effect in literary art which are unchangeable and eternal and when a place has been claimed for a contemporary writer in the classic literature of the world it has triedhonestly and faithfully tried according to its lights to find a proper place for him but then it must be remembered that in exercising these two functions it often becomes necessary to apply to one and the same writer canons of criticism of two opposite kinds that loose leniency of judgement which may he rightly exercised when the critic has only to balance one work of contemporary fiction with another would be quite out of place when in discussing an edition like this a writers entire works are confronted in order that his proper place may be found in the field of uni versal criticism take for instance the little story  dr jekyll and mr hyde the laudatory criticism upon which is in bulk as regards the story itself like the comets tail in relation to though comet on its appearance as a story a shilling shocker for the railway bookstalls the critics attention was directed to its vividness of narrative and kindred qualities and though perfectly conscious of its worthlessness in the world of literary art he might well be justified in comparing it to its advantage with other tories of its class and literary standing but when it is offered as a classicand this is really how it is offered  it has to be 1 udged by critical canons of a very different ind it has then to be compared and contrasted with stories having a like motive stories that deal with an idea as old as the oldest literatureas old no doubt as those primaeval days when man awoke to the consciousness that he is a moral and a responsible beingstories whose temper has always been up to now of the loftiest kind it is many years since in writing of the parables of buddhaghosha it was our business to treat at length of the grand idea of mans dual nature and the many beautiful forms in which it has been embodied we said then that from the lovely modern story of arsene houssaye where a young man starting along lifes road sees on a lawn a beautiful girl and loves her and afterwardswhen sin has soiled him finds that she was his own soul stained now by his own sin and from the still more impressive though less lovely modern story of edgar poe 4 william wilson up to the earliest allegories upon the subject no writer or storyteller had dared to degrade by gross treatment a motive of such universal appeal to the great heart of the  great man mankind we traced the idea as far as our knowledge went through calderon back to oriental sources and found as we then could truly affirm that this motivefrom the ethical point of view the most pathetic and solemn of all motiveshad been always treated with a nobility and a greatness that did honour to literary art manu after telling us that single is each man born into the world  single dies implores each one to collect virtue in order that after death he may be met by the virtuous part of his dual self a beautiful companion and guide in traversing that gloom which is so hard to be traversed fine as this is it is surpassed by an arabian story we then quoted since versified by sir edwin arnoldthe story of the wicked king who met after death a frightful hag for an eternal companion and found her to be only a part of his own dual nature the embodiment of his own evil deeds and even this is surpassed by that lovely allegory in arda yiraf in which a virtuous soul in paradise walking amid pleasant trees whose fragrance was wafted from god meets a part of his own dual nature a beautiful maiden who says to him 0 youth i am thine own actions and we instanced other stories and allegories equally beautiful in which this supreme thought has been treated as soetically as it deserves it was left for tevenson to degrade it into a hideous tale of murder and whitechapel mystery a story of astonishing brutality in which the separation of the two natures of the mans soul is effected not by psychological development and not by the awful alchemy of the spiritworld beyond the grave as in all the previous versions but by the operation of a dose of some supposed new drug if the whole thing is meant as a horrible joke in imitation of de quinceys  murder considered as one of the fine arts it tells poorly for stevensons sense of humour if it is meant as a serious allegory it is an outrage upon the grand allegories of the same motive with which most literatures have been enriched that a story so coarse should have met with the plaudits that dr jekyll and mr hyde met with at the time of its publication  that it should now be quoted in leading articles of important papers every few days while all the various and beautiful renderings of the motive are ignored  what does it mean is it a sign that the shrinkage of the world the solidarity of civilization making the record of each days doings too big for the day has worked a great change in our public writers  is it that they not only have no time to think but no time to read anything beyond the publications of the hour is it that good work is unknown to them and that bad work is forced upon them and that in their busy ignorance they must needs accept it and turn to it for convenient illustration  that stevenson should have been impelled to write the story shows what the  suicide club had already shown that underneath the apparent health which gives such a charm to  treasure island and kidnapped there was that morbid strain which is so often associated with physical disease had it not been for the influence upon him of the healthiest of all writers since chaucerwalter scottstevenson might have been in the ranks of those pompous problemmongers of fiction and the stage who do their best to make life hideous it must be remembered that he was a critic first and a creator afterwards he himself tells us how critically ho studied the methods of other writers before he took to writing himself no one really understood better than he hesiods fine saying that the muses were born in order that they might be a forgetfulness of evils and a truce from cares no one understood better than he jouberts saying  fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality in literature the one aim is the beautiful once lose sight of that and you have the mere frightful reality and for the most part he succeeded in keeping down the morbid impulses of a spirit imprisoned and fretted in a crazy body save in such great mistakes as dr jekyll and mr hyde and a few other stories stevenson acted upon jouberts excellent maxim but scott and scott alone is always right in this matterright by instinct he alone is always a delight if all art is dedicated to joy as schiller declares and if there is no higher and more serious problem than how to make men happy then the waverley novels are among the most precious things in the literature of the world it is in literary criticism especially that though wise man refuses to prophesy unless he knows and no man knows anything about what the future will do with any writer or any book but in the long run the work of every artist in imaginative literature from homer to dickens is remembered by his characters and by his characters alone and the secret of the characterdrawing of the great masters seems to be this while moulding the character from broad general elements from universal types of humanity they are able to delude the readers imagination into mistaking the picture for real portraiture and this they achieve by making the portrait seem to be drawn from particular and peculiar individual traits instead of from generalities and especially by hiding away all purposes  aesthetic ethic or political stevenson as a critic was fully conscious of this law of imaginative art one great virtue of the great masters stevenson appreciated to the full their winsome softness of touch in character drawing we are not fond of comparing literary with pictorial art but between the work of the novelist and the work of the portrait painter there does seem a true analogy as regards the hardness and softness of touch in the drawing of characters in landscape painting that hardness which the general public love is a fault but in portrait painting so important is it to avoid hardness that unless the picture seems to have been blown upon the canvas as in the best work of gainsborough rather than to have been laid upon it by the brush the painter has not achieved a perfect success in the imaginative literature of england the two great masters of this softness of touch in portraiture are addison and sterne three or four hardlydrawn lines in sir roger or the two shandys or corporal trim would have so completely ruined the portraits that they would never have come down to us close upon addison comes fielding and then scott in whose vast gallery almost every portrait is painted with a gainsborough softness scarcely one is limned with those hard lines which are too often apt to mar the glorious work of dickens after scott comes thackeray unless it be mrs gaskell we are not in this article dealing with or even alluding to contemporary writers or we might easily say what novelists follow mrs gaskell whether or not stevensons instinct was for hardness or softness of touch though  new arabian nights show that he did not at first achieve softness his imagination though not robust was fine and it was based on reason he was always able to give a good account of his incidents and ready to do so in a letter now before us he says speaking of the fight on board the covenant in  kidnapped david and alan had every advantage on their side position arms training a good conscience  a handful of merchant sailors not well led in the first attack not led at all in the second could only by an accident have taken the round house by attack  and since the defenders had fire and arms and food it is even doubtful if they could have been starved out the only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught i half believe they would not but with all his undoubted talents and with all his 6tudy of and insight into the artistic methods of the masters has stevenson created any characters so new and so true that they will take their places in the great portrait gallery of classic english fiction  certainly there are one or two that ought to live if room can be found for them among these we are not sure that we can place alan breck he is delightful but a delightful bit of sir walters imagination if the master of ballantrae does not survive it will bo parti because of hardness of touch except for the feeble impression that the character made upon the critics who must in some degree be taken to express the general feeling we should have prophesied a long life for catriona she is a perfectly delightful character delightfully rendered though discussion of stevensons poetry we must

at this time for the occasion of the present notice i the pulblication of the first four volumes only of the new pentland edition of stevcnsons collected works the first volume opening w ith the  inland voyage and the last tjming to a cloe with the new arabian nights that is to say the present issue comlrises the journeyman work of thle writer already master of his tools but still uncertain how bet to employ them and yet the last volume of these preliminary exercise w hich contains the short stories of 1s77 sowu unmitakably in what direction the writer will exhibit hls strength i do not understand why the title of the new arabian nights was extended to tlhe pavilion n the linksi7 a lodging for the night the sire de malktrolt dour and providence and the guitar it surely an lelong only to the suicide club  and the rajas diamond tlhe other tales have no link with these nor are thley in the same genre and the blunder is unfortunate as the greater stories are thus named of the less the modernisation of the caliph haroun alraschid was an adventurous idea brilliantly carried out it puslies one step further into capital farce tennysons identification of king arthur uith a certain english gentleman of stateliest port but the tories themselves a mixture of melodrama and burlesque have not the remotet air of realit and hardly bear a second reading moreover the suicide club  contains ne picture thlat of mr malthus of such a nightmare horriblenes that it would not have passed the censor in any community of utopia there must have been a strain of lbrutalitv tomehere in stevenons fine natuie which cropped out once and again even in the later books  the body snatcher publihed ave the mark as a christmas stoi was the ornl tale in which thlis strain predominated  but the character of old pew in  treasure island and mfr hvde the alter teo of lr jekyll are imaginations that ought not to have been imagined plato we mav le sure would have invited their creator to leave ills commonwealth at the earlict posoille moment however this strain in the nature if i maw put it so wa for the most part kept well in check by mor e gentle anld humane qualities there are strong cen  stark characters enough in other talesnorthmour for examjle in thle pavilion on the links and the fraudulent banker huddletone in the same story is as much as mr malthus a study in the psychology of fear but these characters are well within the limits of literary decency the pavilion on the links indeed has all the qualities which combine to make the true stevenson there is the landscape so well drawn and so completely in key with the beauty or horror of the situation  there is the single vivid incident etched in with acid sharp and unforgettablein this case the noise of the wet finger on the windowpane without and the voice that shouted traditore through the shutters there is the wholesomeness of the sentiment  in the aristotelian sense of thle word  and there is the perfection of thle phraning the romantic tale of the strange courtship that weent on in the two hours before dawn inside the  sire de imaltroits oor  is singularly beautiful and unlike anything elc in fiction and then there are those charming french  artits in  providence and the guitar studied it would seem from a brokerdown actor and his wife full of sentiment described in the  inland oyage who preaclh tlat christian lesson which stevenson was never tired of inculcating that the life of a man does not consit in the abundance of things which he possesses finally there is a lodging for the night with its two scenes in the inn parlour and the lord of brisetouts kotel i do not believe that villon was as stevenson has represented him a compound of wolf and pig with some unexplalned calacity for making lballades but with no capacity fior seeing anything in his chivalrous host for the night but a very dull old gentleman the philosophy of revolt against societv which stevenson has elsewhere expounded should have saved him from such a lapse of critical imagination but strike out the name of the poet and one can enjoy to the full the vividnes of the contrast between the two scene and the wintry paris landscape that unites them the mention of villon brings me to speak of the only part of stevenon early writing which seem to fail of its mark and that i the critical work collected into  familiar studic of men and books stevenson in his humble lpreface recognie his tendency to depreciate a curious fault in an exponent of the philosophy of looking always on the better side but stevenson was not built for a critic his imagination was always at work on the material that came before him for study what seemed a striking saying summoned up in his mind a vivid picture of the man who would say such a thing and this became for him the man s true portrait but if the saying was really but an obiter dictum not really characteristic or if by some chance it had been misinterpreted then the whole character was miread i do not believe as i have said in the character drawn of francois villon most scotsmen fail to see the likeness in the portrait of burns but with that controveraan englishman had better not intermeddle but any reader of pepys diary  can see that stevensons  little sensualist in a periwig  is far enough from the truth about that interesting person it may be worth while to indicate a few points in which the painter has misrepresented his sitter because when a great artist paints a portrait we are apt to take the lifelikeness for granted and also because stevenson believed he had done pepys something more than justice take for a very clear example of misrepresentation the passage about the relations of pepys with william pen the quakermeanwhile there was growing up next door to him that beautiful nature william pen it is odd that pepys condemned him for a fop odd though natural enough when you see pens portrait that pepys was jealous of him with his wife but the cream of the story is when pen publishes his  sandy founda tion shaken and pepys has it read aloud by his wife i find it he savs  so well writ as i think it is too good for him ever to have writ it and it is a serious sort of book and not fit for cverybody to read tht italics are stevensons nothing is more galling to the mnerely respectable than to be brought in cortact with religious ardour pepys had his own foundation sandy enough but dear to him from practical considerations and he would read the book with true uneasiness of spirit for conceive the blow if by some plague accident this pen wvere to convert him and so on for some dozen lines more but if the reader one in ten thousand were to turn to pepys to see what he really did say about pens bookl he would find that what he thought dangerous in it wovas not its enthusiasm but its heresy this is the passage  pelling bath got me wl pens book against the trinity i got my wife to read it to me etc the title of the book was  the sandy foundations shaken or those doctrines of one god subsisting in three distinct and separate persons etc refuted from the authority of scripture testimonies and right reason so that all stevensons very cynical commentary on the words not fit for everybody to read rests on a simple misunderstanding or take another point pepys buys a i roguish french book and notes in his diary that he bought it in plain binding meaning to burn it when read  that it may not stand in the list of books nor among them to disgrace them if it should be found stevenson paraphrases this  he is full of precautions to conceal the disgrace of the purchase but pepyvs is writing as a collector with a respect to the dignity of his library he is not even considering the question about the morality or immorality of reading  roguish  books so again stevensons idea that pepys was a sort of leaf insect who took his moral colour from his neighbours and was only virtuous when under the influence of sir william coventry is not supported by the diary coventry was no better than his contemporaries in regard to the seenth commandment and in regard to the eighth we find him more than once making a sort of apologia to pepys or once more what ground is there for stevensons wild idea that pepys intended his diar to be one day made public  i the greatness of his life he says  was open yet he longed to communicate its smallness also and while contemporaries bowed before him he must buttonhole posterity with the news that his periwig was once alive with nits i confess lively writing of this sort whet it belittles the characters of the dead without a spark of evidence makes me angry stevenson quotes the solemn sentence with which the diary closes but if he had raised his eves to the sentence next before it he would have found that it disposed of his theory  and thus ends all that i doubt i shall ever be able to do with my own eves in the keeping of my journal i being not able to do it any longer having done now so long as to undo my eves almost every time that i take a pen in my hand and therefore whatever comes of it i must forbear and therefore resolve from this time forward to have it kept by my people in longhand ard must be contented to set down no more than is fit for then e9nd all the world to know or if there be anything i must ndeavour to keep a margin in my book open to add here end there a note in shorthand with my own hand young entlemen with a genius for style should be warned oxf riticism the valuable part of stevensons writing outside his stories  that in which he writes about himself about himself aid his travels and his meditations on men and things we could niever have too much because he looked at the world with tresh eyes i have a fancy for testing a mans powers of natural description by his handling of a snowstorm iand i remember the joy it gave me years ago to come upon this passage of our author the snow fell with rigorous relentless persistence sometimes the wind made a sllv and scattered it in flying vortices smetimes there was a lull and flake after flake descended out f the black nigh air silent circuitous interminable tfhe air was raw and pointed but not far below freezing and the flakes were large damp and adhesive the whole city was sheeted up an armnv might have marched from end to end and not a footfall giv fii the alarm if there were any belated birds in heaven they br w the island like a laree white datch and the bridges like slim white spars on the black ground of the river but in the travel books natural description is kept in due subordination to the proper study of mankind and there as in the moral essays wie find stevenson acclaiming with joy mans imperfect virtues and calling upon every body to take up the great task of being happy themselves anti making others happp quotation would be an endless luxury but one passage may be allowed which we may well believe seemed to its author the conclusion of the whole matter certainly for himselfall who have meant good vork with their wvhole hearts have done good work although they may die before they have the time to sign it every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a houpeful impulse behind it in the world and bettered the tradition of mankind and even if death catch people like an open pitfall and in mid

B4665,['6727320'],  literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all

B6772,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,storie

published this time last year messrs thomas hood t w robertson w j prowse w s gilbert c w scott and thomas archer have clubbed together to produce under the editorship of the firstnamed gentleman another similar collection of tales to which they have ven the title of  rates and taxes the various narratives are held together by a little story the separate portions of which cornmence and finish the volume after the fashion of mr dickenss christmas numbers in the present instance we are introduced to the state of things at one time existing in  the united parishes of st barabbas and ananias the less which parishes though united in name were very disunited in spirit being in fact at constant feud how the new curate by his mild and benignant spirit effected a thorough reconciliation and a genuine union and how the rate and taxcollectors had weekly meetings at the  greyhound and told stories based on their personal experiences we must leave the reader to find out for himself we shall only inform him that the stories so told are five in number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds seven flights is a collection of fairy tales and supernatural narratives clustered about one parent fiction with which all are slowly connected the sedan chair in question is a magic structure endured with powers simila to those of the wonderful carpet 1 in the arabian tale or the wishing caps in northern legends that is to say the owner has only to seat himself in it and to desire to be in a certain place and he is there in a moment when he wishes to return the sedan having disappeared immediately on  setting down he is to exclaim sedan appear and there it stands ready to do its masters bidding it has been constructed by a moorish astrologer and is the property of the successive heads of the old english family of the nevilles by whom it is preserved in a strange dunsky mansion at westminster the first possessor is sir wilfred neville a harumscarum fellow of queen elizabeths reign who uses it for visiting various parts of the world where he meets with a variety of strange adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number by mr tenniela most charming contrast in their grace delicacy finish  and airy fancy to the ugly phantasmagoria in which so many of the artists of the present day indulge balderscourt follows the fashion common with christmas books and is a concretion of small stories embedded in one large mass a christmas party is assembled at an old eliabethan mansion on the welsh borders and as the younger ones want something to excite them in the long evenings the elders relate or read diverse tales some of these have relation to matters of fact others are purely imaginary a few fairy tales being among the number the book is well written and fall of amusing matter while some very fair illustrations add to the attractiveness of the whole miss bowmans  boy pilgrims  is a book of which the object is the conveying of information on geography and history though it takes the form of a story two boys set out under the guardianship of a friend to visit the chief countries and cities of the east and thus we are introduced to acounts of 4gy syria palestine and other bible lands plenty of adventure seasons the less exciting parts of the narrative and for boys who like this mode of getting at facts the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course we have nothing more to say mr rennes  featherland or how the birds lived at greelawn is a tale which will probably amuse children being all about birds and beasts who are made to talk in the manner

chambers ye christmas number of london society beetons christmas annual beeton comic newes christmas box it is difficult to say why the public taste should be supposed to evince a disposition about christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the garrulous old lodging housekeeper bear mar s of the hand which gave us mrs gamp and mr micawber we may particularise the scene between majorjackman and the taxgatherer i i i i i i i i ii which as a piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle brings back reminiscences of the fanoru ghostly mailcoach which carried though deadletters in pickwick the story of the poor relation is readable and suitable and that of the schoolboy though much too prolix is in its wild but somewhat picturesquo improbability by far the most seasonaake of the collection a bunch of keys the next work on our list aspires more we apprehend to the nature of a giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on the part of halfadozen young writers that the good ol0 custom of christmas annuals should not die out altogether the editor is mr thomas hood the framework is contributed by mr t w robertson and the stories are written by messrs t archer w s gilbert t hood iv j prowse and clement scott mr robertson has bestowed more pains than are usual upo01 his part of the task andl has given uis a very

kindheinrted lighthousekeeper who gets theni to fish with a net the result of which is that they catch a  bunch of keys and the more intellectual lrother getting wet in the process ii put to bed and dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that gorgeouslycovered and cleverlyillustrated magazine london society has also issued an extra christmas number containing no less than fourteen stories and poems we cannot say much for the merit of the letterpress but many of the illustrations are pretty and wellengraved and we hare no doubt that the stories some of which are by wellknown authors will be found sufficiently amusing by those less

city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has

london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the thief in consequence of his too grasping stipulation loses both eyes falls into a well and is drowned nos 3139 give in a readable form a number of the stories about raja rasalu

B6919,"['6658923', '8968534']",  bluebeards keys and other stories by miss thackeray london smith elder  co 1874 there is a subtle charm in miss thackerays writing which is not easily defined in words it is like the scent of an oldfashioned garden on a dewy evening and we are as grateful for the memories and associations it brings back to us as for its own sweetness and worth her stories are a series of exquisite little sketches full of tender light and shadow and soft harmonious colouring sho  adds the gleam though light that never was on land or sea to commonplace things so that when we have finished reading one of her books we instinctively begin to put the circumstances of our own lives into the most picturesque attitude possible she gives us also a pleasant sense of being at peace with ourselves  she is so genial so sympathetic so manysided that we seem to have a friend near us who is putting into smooth and pleasant words undefined thoughts of our own who brings from remote corners of our brain long forgotten gleams of sunshine sweet dim faces sights and sounds of long ago until we are surprised at the amount of our own resources and it is not only the picturesque side of the commonplace which miss thackeray puts before us for she has inherited much of the power which her father had above all other writers of feeling in their due proportions the humour aud though pathos of everyday life wordsworth has said of the poet that he is one endowed with more sensibility more enthusiasm and tenderness who has a greater knowledge of human nature and a more comprehensive soul than aro supposed to be common among mankind  one who rejoices more than others in the spirit of life that is in him this  spirit of life  is preeminent in all miss thackerays writings in elizabeth breaking through the formalities of the french pastors home and asserting her own true self through all her pathetic little love story  in the breezy village on the cliff with its naive little katharine its ugly fascinating frenchmen its largehearted reine  in the pretty stories which have modernised so gracefully our old fairy tales the last volume of which bluebeards keys and other stories smith elder  co lies before us and none of the sketches are more charming than these last four the roman life in the first story of  bluebeards keys the swiss pictures in  riquet a la houppe the quiet english scenery of  jack and the beanstalk and the pretty bit of normandy in the  white cat are as faithfully described as the fairy tales are successfully represented bluebeard is an italian marquis who nearly scares away the wits of his little irish betrothed and finally becomes a monk riquet a la houppe is a certain tom rickets who wins his love by sheer strength of purpose and in spite of every personal disadvantage jack is a clever and highminded young farmer who overcomes a giant squire and carries off his harp in the shape of his daughter and  the white cat is a pretty young girl in the white dress of a novice who is saved by her lover from the convent life which she dreads it is unfortunate that miss thackerays gift of language has led her into a certain indistinctness of utterance that may become if not corrected a serious blemish on her writing old kensington suffered from it and there are some notable examples of it in the book before us miss thackeray feels herself so entirely en rapport with her readers that she believes and probably believes rightly that they will gather her meaning from such a passage as the following which occurs in  jack and the beanstalk   foxslip wood in summertimo is a delightful place green to the soul beyond the coppice here and there where though branches break asunder swfet tumults f delicate shadowy hills are jlowing to gleam of light cloud  with somo people everything means everything miss thackeray tells us and therefore we need not ask though meaning of miss gorges curious pale blue sympathetic glances  but with every wish to understand it we find ourselves battled by this next quotation   soni years are profitless when we look back to them others seem to be treasuries to which we turn again and ngain when our store is spent outtreasuries of sunny mornings green things birds piping friends greeting voices of children at play how happy and busy they are as they heap up their stores golden chaff crimson tints chestnuts silver lights it is all put away for future use nnd years hence they will who will   look back to it and the lights of their fast whose past will reach them as staright reaches usclear sweet vivid and entire travelling through time and space this indistinctness is only to be found in miss thackerays later writings there is no trace of it in the story of elizabeth and it seems a pity when her thoughts are so well worth having that they should be kept from us by any obscurity or hurried and careless expression but these blemishes are few in number when compared with all the passages that are as beautiful as the following from  bluebeards keys   it was a great dazzling italian day italian days seem longer and more vivid than any others every minute is marked  something is happening and passing away retlectious lighting the red cypress trees flowers blooming pigeons flying across the blue or rubbing their breasts upon the yellow marble of a window lintel waters foam and figures fill their earthen pitchers you look up at the great palaces with their treasures enshrined  outside are stone galleries with blue high vaults and statues and pictures glittering and alive a grand conception of a saint in flying drapery comes down the steps of the piccio little beppo and his sister the little mpdels come dancing to the carriagesteps with soft

winsome little caper as she gives her coin to her beautiful albanian mother who sits watching the children with her chin upon her hands and a great basket of violets shining at her feet and the swiss

sits at work all day there is a garden down below full of lupins aud sunflowers and scarlet runners against a trellis the hottd cook is walking there between his courses all dressed in white my sketch

the goats tinkle home at night each cow rings its bell as it browses the turf nnd the wild thyme the people are at work upon the hills reaping their saffron crops if i look out i see a mountain with a grey dome of clouds and shadows c this sort of writing is nearly as good as chango of air we must give ono more short extract which is worthy of miss thackerays father there are some people who all their lives long have to be content with halfbrewed ale the dregs of the cup envelopes cheeseparings fingers of friendship to take the lowest place at the feast of life is not always so easily done as people imagine there are times and hours when everybody is equal when even the humblest nature conceives the best and longs for it aud cannot feel quite content with a part you may be courageous

B3350,['6838455'],  shorter reviews i stories for moral instruction by f j gould rwatts and co 2s the instruction of the child in the elements of right and wrong apart from the inevitable school routine of merely useful information is one of those persistent problems which in these controversial days tend to become acute it is not enough of course to teach children the shape and size and origin of the world they live in its history and possibilities and peculiarities they must have some notion of how to conduct themselves conformably to societys demands in their progress through it this is that implicit education which would arrive naturally in nearly every case since any violent collision of behaviour or language with the accepted customs brings about reprisals which are so certain that they might almost be termed automatic intelligent and reasoning beings though their authors may be but further than this the beginner on lifes tortuous way must be supported morally must in some measure be fortified and informed as to the why and wherefore of these mysteries of right and wrong which soon are found to hedge him about so thickly so bafflingly and how to do this wisely and well yet without losing the interest and attention of the child is the difficulty which has puzzled many fine teachers and worried the brains of many excellent preachers our grandparents and greatgrandparents accomplished much by means of those quaint and innocuous moral storybooks which were the fare set plentifully before eager youth at that period of development stilted and dry enough these battered volumes seem to us today and we may safely conclude that the children of the present would turn from them in distaste this book compiled by mr f j gould which we have before us is therefore a little surprising it almost seems a case of a return to the oldfashioned methods we are aware that it is intended primarily for the use of teachers and that it is not to be read directly by the children but the thought occurs to us that a fairly large amount of modification will have to be performed by any tactful instructor before he can handle it to advantage if he keeps to the stories and gives them baldly so much the better for the moral tags and smug little lessons tacked on to each page are rather too obvious they have in some cases a distinct flavour of comicality children see through this sort of thing today they resent  morals  and  applications tell them stories by all means but be very sure that the child is quite sharp enough to draw the necessary meaning without having it ladled up to him afterwards as though the jam preceded the pill some of these tales are taken from wellknown books of fairystories we fancy the average child would prefer to read the stories for himself or herself and leave the sentences of precise application to the imagination of some wellmeaning person like the author of this book the healthy child detests anything approaching the  goodygoody  school it is out of date condemned by the precious little prigs it brought into being after a story or two under the heading of advice mr gould sees fib to expatiate as followswhen we want to do certain things and our friends happen to advise us to do as we wish all is well the comb combs smoothly but when our friends advise us to do something we do not wish to do we perhaps think the friends crabby and illnatured  the comb combs painfully but that is our owia fault we may be wishing for something that is not good of course peoples advice is not always good for us but if we know that they care fr us and love us we should listen to what they say like the mole they may know more about trees than we da ourselves like the monkey we may go wrong through not learning from other people all that they would willingly tell us like the boy we may not find our friends advice pleasant but we should remember that they desire our welfare surely this sort of writing is labour wasted there is plenty more of it though your sword be rusty and your steed mean your good hearts will achieve the victory for the cause of the people a statement which is open to doubt  better to turn grey while serving the world than turn grey while living for our own sake alone here is the concluding moral from a tale entitled the sensible woman you and i cannot help smiling either after all the woman id no harm the trick she played upon her husband was an innocent one he was such a simpleton that i suppose she often had to manage him as if he were a child when we look round the world we find a good many simple folk who think they are clever and fine fellows and all the time they have to be governed by people who are more sensible well and that is the use of common sense those of us who have more wit than our neighbours must do our best to keep the world in order and improve it you know how we are obliged to lock up insane people in asylums in like manner we have to govern certain wild tribes of africa and other regions that is why it is nice to be wise and sensible because it enables us to help the people who are not so well able to help themselves we should do it with good humour and as neighhours and not in a stuckup manner as if we felt ourselves to be a superior race the sententiousness of this is rather amusing it verges on pomposity and we fancy that most children would not gain much guidance from it also it is not very complimentary to the teacher that he should have his morals writ largely in front of him in such a hopelessly correct fashion the stories are all very well in themselves and it was a happy idea to include  the story of the nibelungs  this is rendered in a very pleasant and comprehensive manner and will doubtless be new to a great many children those who have charge of children will find the collection of so many tales and legends in a handy volume a great help in classwork without doubt and in this respect the book may be useful they will prefer however if they have succeeded in setting up that sympathy with their little friends which is the basis of all good work in education to omit the printed moral and leave the tale unadorned the children may be trusted to read the hidden meanings and as far as our own experience goes they most decidedly rebel at any attempt to rub it in,storie

B3433,['6838455'],  shorter reviews i stories for moral instruction by f j gould rwatts and co 2s the instruction of the child in the elements of right and wrong apart from the inevitable school routine of merely useful information is one of those persistent problems which in these controversial days tend to become acute it is not enough of course to teach children the shape and size and origin of the world they live in its history and possibilities and peculiarities they must have some notion of how to conduct themselves conformably to societys demands in their progress through it this is that implicit education which would arrive naturally in nearly every case since any violent collision of behaviour or language with the accepted customs brings about reprisals which are so certain that they might almost be termed automatic intelligent and reasoning beings though their authors may be but further than this the beginner on lifes tortuous way must be supported morally must in some measure be fortified and informed as to the why and wherefore of these mysteries of right and wrong which soon are found to hedge him about so thickly so bafflingly and how to do this wisely and well yet without losing the interest and attention of the child is the difficulty which has puzzled many fine teachers and worried the brains of many excellent preachers our grandparents and greatgrandparents accomplished much by means of those quaint and innocuous moral storybooks which were the fare set plentifully before eager youth at that period of development stilted and dry enough these battered volumes seem to us today and we may safely conclude that the children of the present would turn from them in distaste this book compiled by mr f j gould which we have before us is therefore a little surprising it almost seems a case of a return to the oldfashioned methods we are aware that it is intended primarily for the use of teachers and that it is not to be read directly by the children but the thought occurs to us that a fairly large amount of modification will have to be performed by any tactful instructor before he can handle it to advantage if he keeps to the stories and gives them baldly so much the better for the moral tags and smug little lessons tacked on to each page are rather too obvious they have in some cases a distinct flavour of comicality children see through this sort of thing today they resent  morals  and  applications tell them stories by all means but be very sure that the child is quite sharp enough to draw the necessary meaning without having it ladled up to him afterwards as though the jam preceded the pill some of these tales are taken from wellknown books of fairystories we fancy the average child would prefer to read the stories for himself or herself and leave the sentences of precise application to the imagination of some wellmeaning person like the author of this book the healthy child detests anything approaching the  goodygoody  school it is out of date condemned by the precious little prigs it brought into being after a story or two under the heading of advice mr gould sees fib to expatiate as followswhen we want to do certain things and our friends happen to advise us to do as we wish all is well the comb combs smoothly but when our friends advise us to do something we do not wish to do we perhaps think the friends crabby and illnatured  the comb combs painfully but that is our owia fault we may be wishing for something that is not good of course peoples advice is not always good for us but if we know that they care fr us and love us we should listen to what they say like the mole they may know more about trees than we da ourselves like the monkey we may go wrong through not learning from other people all that they would willingly tell us like the boy we may not find our friends advice pleasant but we should remember that they desire our welfare surely this sort of writing is labour wasted there is plenty more of it though your sword be rusty and your steed mean your good hearts will achieve the victory for the cause of the people a statement which is open to doubt  better to turn grey while serving the world than turn grey while living for our own sake alone here is the concluding moral from a tale entitled the sensible woman you and i cannot help smiling either after all the woman id no harm the trick she played upon her husband was an innocent one he was such a simpleton that i suppose she often had to manage him as if he were a child when we look round the world we find a good many simple folk who think they are clever and fine fellows and all the time they have to be governed by people who are more sensible well and that is the use of common sense those of us who have more wit than our neighbours must do our best to keep the world in order and improve it you know how we are obliged to lock up insane people in asylums in like manner we have to govern certain wild tribes of africa and other regions that is why it is nice to be wise and sensible because it enables us to help the people who are not so well able to help themselves we should do it with good humour and as neighhours and not in a stuckup manner as if we felt ourselves to be a superior race the sententiousness of this is rather amusing it verges on pomposity and we fancy that most children would not gain much guidance from it also it is not very complimentary to the teacher that he should have his morals writ largely in front of him in such a hopelessly correct fashion the stories are all very well in themselves and it was a happy idea to include  the story of the nibelungs  this is rendered in a very pleasant and comprehensive manner and will doubtless be new to a great many children those who have charge of children will find the collection of so many tales and legends in a handy volume a great help in classwork without doubt and in this respect the book may be useful they will prefer however if they have succeeded in setting up that sympathy with their little friends which is the basis of all good work in education to omit the printed moral and leave the tale unadorned the children may be trusted to read the hidden meanings and as far as our own experience goes they most decidedly rebel at any attempt to rub it in,storie

of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may

express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in

ransacked rubbish among which nobody else would have though of hunting for a discovery of treasure and he has found morsels of treasure often in books that were thrown aside as empty centuries ago and seldom have been opened since they were dismissed from notice the complete absence of literary bias is an admirable qualification for a gatherer if there be sometimes a confusion between diamonds and broken glass that matters not very much who would refuse a bag of jewels because bristol stones and spangles form a fourth part of its bulk the  many thoughts are here arranged in the form of an analytical dictionary we look up in this dictionary any subject under the sun and are pretty sure to find something that has been said generally well said upon it not seldom it is something good that

edition of the scripture characters 26 of dr candlish whose fame is deservedly great among scotch divines and a new series of mr arnots illustrations of the book of proverbs 27 which are brief numerous and very practical to these volumes by scotch divines we add a little christmas book contributed by members of a very different communion unitarian writers some of them high in literary

the scotch church to the unitarian church we may go on to speak of mr william smiths thormdale or the conflict qf opinions 29 the book is not theological or controversial but it builds on the foundation of a little story a pleasant edifice of conflicting speculation upon social problems and the inner life of man the book is the work of a sound thinker who is well read in philosophy and has

childs book upon birds of many kinds two or three small books of pure fancy must be included in our sketch of christmas literature one is the wayside fancies 47 of mrs broderip daughter of thomas hood this little volume published in the summer well deserves to be remembered in the winter and to pass from hand to hand among the gift books of the present season the delicacies of the fathers character are transmitted more surely through the daughter than his humour was transmitted through the son mrs broderip tells how she and her brother played at authorship as children and now they have both written books each book is good but in these  wayside fancies we find evidences of the finer taste and surer traces of a latent strength the book is one in which a genial reader will take pleasure and it is the only original miscellany in prose and verse worth mentioning among the new books ready against christmas of a stock less poetical has come a writer of good versemiss mary humewho furnishes for christmas yormiton 48 a story none the less acceptable for being presented to us as a dramatic tale in smooth blank verse with every thought in it carefully weighed and polished we have more than once protested against the foppery of scorning thoughts better than one usually is content to read in prose because the verse in which they are communicated is not of the highest quality there is a metrical literature in this day fed by the best energies and aspirations of highminded men and women not a few of whom would have obtained honour as poets in an age of feebler or less universal effort we believe that the public denies pleasure to itself and fairly earned esteem where it is due when it neglects wholly this good metrical literature which has grown up on the middle ground between our poetry and prose there ought to be a public ready for any clever and truehearted book like miss humes normiton or mr lockyers earl godwins feast 49 or mr lockers london lyrics 50 we commend these three metrical books to the notice of all christmas readers in  london lyrics there is the liveliness of much gay bumour blended with good feeling and a quaint etching by george cruikshank of cupids

publishers desire at the festive season storytelling is as much an institution of christmas as plumpuddings and pantomimes for months before the close of the year dozens of busy pens are at work setting down the fancies of dozens of busy brains and with december there comes a rash of storybooks a heap of these ephemeral fictions lies before us and we proceed to give some account of each individual in the lot encouraged by the success of their  bunch of keys published this time last year messrs thomas hood t w robertson w j prowse w s gilbert c w scott and thomas archer have clubbed together to produce under the editorship of the firstnamed gentleman another similar collection of tales to which they have ven the title of  rates and taxes the various narratives are held together by a little story the separate portions of which cornmence and finish the volume after the fashion of mr dickenss christmas numbers in the present instance we are introduced to the state of things at one time existing in  the united parishes of st barabbas and ananias the less which parishes though united in name were very disunited in spirit being in fact at constant feud how the new curate by his mild and benignant spirit effected a thorough reconciliation and a genuine union and how the rate and taxcollectors had weekly meetings at the  greyhound and told stories based on their personal experiences we must leave the reader to find out for himself we shall only inform him that the stories so told are five in number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds seven flights is a collection of fairy tales and supernatural narratives clustered about one parent fiction with which all are slowly connected the sedan chair in question is a magic structure endured with powers simila to those of the wonderful carpet 1 in the arabian tale or the wishing caps in northern legends that is to say the owner has only to seat himself in it and to desire to be in a certain place and he is there in a moment when he wishes to return the sedan having disappeared immediately on  setting down he is to exclaim sedan appear and there it stands ready to do its masters bidding it has been constructed by a moorish astrologer and is the property of the successive heads of the old english family of the nevilles by whom it is preserved in a strange dunsky mansion at westminster the first possessor is sir wilfred neville a harumscarum fellow of queen elizabeths reign who uses it for visiting various parts of the world where he meets with a variety of strange adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number by mr tenniela most charming contrast in their grace delicacy finish  and airy fancy to the ugly phantasmagoria in which so many of the artists of the present day indulge balderscourt follows the fashion common with christmas books and is a concretion of small stories embedded in one large mass a christmas party is assembled at an old eliabethan mansion on the welsh borders and as the younger ones want something to excite them in the long evenings the elders relate or read diverse tales some of these have relation to matters of fact others are purely imaginary a few fairy tales being among the number the book is well written and fall of amusing matter while some very fair illustrations add to the attractiveness of the whole miss bowmans  boy pilgrims  is a book of which the object is the conveying of information on geography and history though it takes the form of a story two boys set out under the guardianship of a friend to visit the chief countries and cities of the east and thus we are introduced to acounts of 4gy syria palestine and other bible lands plenty of adventure seasons the less exciting parts of the narrative and for boys who like this mode of getting at facts the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course we have nothing more to say mr rennes  featherland or how the birds lived at greelawn is a tale which will probably amuse children being all about birds and beasts who are made to talk in the manner of human beings the last book on our list fairy lend or recreation for the rising generation by the late thomas and jane hood their son and daughter is a second edition and therefore known to the public it is a charming collection of fairy t  in which humour is quaintly blended with fancy  christmas stories mrs lirrpers legacy chapman and hall a  bunch of keys groombridge tenants at will chambers ye christmas number of london society beetons christmas annual beeton comic newes christmas box it is difficult to say why the public taste should be supposed to evince a disposition about christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the garrulous old lodging housekeeper bear mar s of the hand which gave us mrs gamp and mr micawber we may particularise the scene between majorjackman and the taxgatherer i i i i i i i i ii which as a piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle brings back reminiscences of the fanoru ghostly mailcoach which carried though deadletters in pickwick the story of the poor relation is readable and suitable and that of the schoolboy though much too prolix is in its wild but somewhat picturesquo improbability by far the most seasonaake of the collection a bunch of keys the next work on our list aspires more we apprehend to the nature of a giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on the part of halfadozen young writers that the good ol0 custom of christmas annuals should not die out altogether the editor is mr thomas hood the framework is contributed by mr t w robertson and the stories are written by messrs t archer w s gilbert t hood iv j prowse and clement scott mr robertson has bestowed more pains than are usual upo01 his part of the task andl has given uis a very pleasant sketch of two young brothers who finding somne theatrical dresses elope with theni and wander alout the country as savage boy aild his keeper ultiniately they break down are taken in by a kindheinrted lighthousekeeper who gets theni to fish with a net the result of which is that they catch a  bunch of keys and the more intellectual lrother getting wet in the process ii put to bed and dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that gorgeouslycovered and cleverlyillustrated magazine london society has also issued an extra christmas number containing no less than fourteen stories and poems we cannot say much for the merit of the letterpress but many of the illustrations are pretty and wellengraved and we hare no doubt that the stories some of which are by wellknown authors will be found sufficiently amusing by those less surfeited with this kind of literature than we confess to being at present  beotons christmas anual  is a thick shillingworth of tales burlesques nonsense mintkids a rid dlas the ptlnoipia story called snumbet see is by no means auingo but the old fairtales i a chinese doiste clet and the illustrations to them our list must cnclude with the  christmas number of the cbmie now the miotity of the articles in this are not worth noticing but the description of the hardships undergone by a  supet in a pantomine is grapluc and well illustrated and the  diary of a late cannibal which is man fridays view of the character of robinson crusoe is novel and amusing  christmas books4 bat year is felt as severely in the bookmarket as in any other it is not surprising therefore that our christmas literature is somewvhat scarce considering the general state of trade in the case of our annual we are compelled to go to press before the publishing houses have quite made xp their lists of christmas publications and in consequence  our table is not so full as usual we pass under review with great pleasure such books as have already arrived and in the december number of our magazine hope to be of some further service to our readers in recommending to them the best friends for their winter hours of leisure the office of a magazine reviewer is more to suggest than to criticise strongly the reader who turns to our pages for notices of books may rely on candid advice and be sure that consideration for the interests of the public alone leads us to offer it  the rose and the lily how they became the emblems of france and england a fairy tale by mrs octavian blewitt london chatto and windus this is one of the prettiest books of the season and particularly recommends itself to our notice the subject is not a new one but it may safely be said that none but a transcendent genitis can at the present day find anything new in fairy literature the whole world of imagination in this direction has been already ransacked and although new beauties may be added to the old originality is almost impossible mrs blewitts work is very far above the average her imagination has vigour and colouring while the language in which she clothes her conceptions possesses considerable power and derives grace and elegance from a cultivated mind and a ladylike sensibility she has chosen the sweetest of flowers for her discourse and strives by her story to inculcate in the young the duty of selfrestraint the misery of faithlessness and the still more important lesson of the real place occupied by the truly penitent we are too apt to consign the frail sinner to eternal punishment the poor lily is not only forgiven for her want of trust in the protection of the fairy titania but allowed to look forward to happiness when the expiation of her sin is complete and she ultimately has the high destiny of blazoning the victorious standard of the french monarchy the rose by contrast is not so prominently remarkable but her story as interwoven with that of the lily has its own charm and the little volume will be highly appreciated by all persons of poetic fancy in an age when most literature is or tends towards being prosaic much of the grace of poetic phraseology must be stifled or cut out but mrs blewitt has not behaved badly to us in this respect here and there the poetess breaks forth and generally the diction is pleasing one or two little bits of verse are noticeable for their delicacy as also the contrast brought into full relief between the english and the french fairies as typical of the lighter genius of our neighbours the frontispiece of the work deserves especial notice it is a most beautiful and charming design instinct with poetic and high artistic fancy from the pencil of george cruikshank executed by the veteran artist at the great age of eightythree for the sake of this engraving alone the book is worth adding to a library from the same firm we have  boudoir ballads  and  gastronomy as a fine art the latter translated by r e anderson mia from the work of brillatsavarin the former is essentially a  made  book and notwithstanding the high praise accorded to mlr sterrys verses by some weekly journals we cannot but express our surprise at the productions of a rhymester many little better than mere doggrel beingthought fit for publication in this most costly form it is impossible to speak too highly of the care and labour bestowed upon the book by the publishers there is something exquisite about paper print and binding the sight of such a work makes us long to present a copy to every young lady of our acquaintance and we have not we think ever seen a volume more artistically designed and produced from title page to finis it is rather disappointing therefore to find the matter contained in the 2 i 7 pages of the most meagre proportions though we must owvn to a feeling of rejoicing that there is no more of it the fact is the verses were written for magazines and weeklies and might well have been allowed to remain there here and there one alights upon some beautiful sentiment but at the same time strangely mingled with it comes into the memory a sunny afternoon when lying beside some faroff stream we revelled in praeds poems at times too we catch the ring of the lighter melodies of betterknown poets and not infrequent is our reminiscence of mr mortimer collins these observations refer to the best of the collection and of the rest we cannot speak in terms of admiration there is a lack of dignity of manliness of all that should characterise a poet in rhymes on a 8 cas girdle  a chinchilla mufi7 or  a girls frill while a man

which to our minds is extremely undesirable in the pages of a book offered to the young miss nash shows a good deal of knowledge of young people and their likes and dislikes and although she loses no opportunity of inculcating a useful lesson she does not continually point a moral and add as so many writers do  this is a moral but leaves the reader to find out her meaning taking care that it shall never be too obscure the book is nicely printed and contains a rather larger share of matter than is usual for books of this description the new firm in arundel street remington and co have sent us isabel st clair a romance of the seventeenth century though it might just as well have been written of any other time the authoress is miss julia addison who has already made some way in the literary world and established a reputation as the writer of girls books and light stories we cannot say there is anything remarkable in her last work but it is agreeably written and possesses some points of interest original incidents are very difficult to be had for a book of this kind the range of which is naturally limited it would be a great mistake to criticise such matters too severely the young heroine is the daughter of a staunch roy alist and comes into the front place in our estimation by a daring act of bravery she rushes into the flames of the castle to save a valuable casket and is as one might expect only rescued by a miracle after this terrible catastrophe our interesting heroine removes with her mother and brother to a quiet cottage they having been dispossessed of the burnt castle by an uncle of a very bad typein fact a1 babes in the wool uncle all oxer miss sinclair has a fancy for doing whatever her mother tells her not to do and in consequence of this failing is run off with and nearly upset by a pony her rescue by an old witch and her subsequent seizure by a gang of the most desperate robbers that ever polluted the country with their presence form the next incidents in the clutches of these villains she improves and develops many brilliant qualities but it is best to leave her with the terrible lawless and his companions and let our readers if we have said enough to interest them in the fate of the fair but wilful girl follow her in her escape from a dreadful death and a return to her fond mother and brother at another time of year mliss addisons book would have stood little chance of success but coming as it does at christmas time we have no doubt it will be fairly popular with juveniles there is not one word in it which can be thought objectionable for the young to peruse in saying this we accord no slight praise to the latest work of the authoress mr arthur h moxon of 2 1 paternoster row sends us a beautiful and unique instalment of a noble work plutarch is one of those classics which will never lose its hold upon the minds of scholars and the beautiful illustrations of mlr j moyr smith designed after the manner of the early greek paintings are in themselves worth possessing every one is too well acquainted with the story of theseus to need a wordh upon its merits as a grand narrative of the life of a hero of old mr smith has taken some of the most powerful scenes in the history and illustrated them with a xvigour and dexterity equal to anything we have lately had the pleasure of looking at the work of which we have at present only one portion wvill when complete be eagerly sought after and cannot fail to add to the artists high reputation for study and intimate knowledge of the beauties of the ancient masters bosh by wv s london bickers and son i leicester square is a most amusing imitation of mr edwvard lears  book of nonsense the author openly confesses his plagiarism and apologises for it by a graceful dedication the rhymes are however only the accessories to the drawings in which the grotesque element prevails the draughtsman possesses more than ordinary ability for this class of work while his labour has been produced in the volume before us with every regard to the obtaining of the full effect of his comical genius particularly comnic is the portrait of the gentleman who is thus described there is a young man at devizes whose feet seem of different sizes the fault he imputes to the make of his bootsand perhaps from that cause it arises and one may fairly notice  an old penron of staines who s accustomed whenever it rains in haste to run out and stand under a spout and there for some time he remains the illustrations to these verses and others are highly amusing the same firm send us the song of the bell and other ballads paraphrased from schiller by arthur mills mp  and we cannot speak too highly of the care bestowed upon these translations mr mills understands thoroughly the spirit of the original and we particularly recommend his  gods of greece  as an addition to the repertoire of penny readings the other poems translated and paraphrased make us regret very much

methodists are described in a manner which shows that mr silas hocking is intimately acquainted with the people of whom he writes but we hope that he has evolved the incident of the rector being ducked in a horsepond by his parishioners out of his inner consciousness  extravagant as are the adventures undergone by a jolly fellowship c kegan paul and co reminding one considerably of those of

frontispiece into imagining that the great napoleon stood eight feet in his bootswe were tempted by the preface to stories of long ago john walker and co into the fond expectation that mr ascott hope had discovered some really unknown or forgotten stories in the gesta romanorurn the lais and fablianx to which he alludes but the stories of  the abbot and the emperor  the anchorite and the angel and  the physician against his will are not quite so forgotten nor is their disguise as impenetrable as he would seem to fancy the punishment of the emperor jovinian seems very poor after the legend of king robert of sicily which mr hope will find in leigh hunts  jar of honey from mount hybla however everybody tells old stories at christmas time and doubtless to many of our young friends these will be as good as new and they certainly deserve full praise for the pure and simple style in which they are narrated of the century of illustrations sorne are humorously conceived and well engraved but they differ much in quality there is a maturity about several of the new fairy or semisupernatural stories of lord brabourne which like exceedingly dry sherry requires a cultivated palate but the aountain sprites kingdom george routledge and sons is sufficiently fantastic for juvenile readers in its quaint humour and riotous fancies which are admirably aided by the illustrations it stands alone in the volume which contains also a story of ancestral and demoniacal rooks who aid the true heir against the lawless tyrant of rookstone we are puzzled by unintentional transformations of the baron fitzuron into the baron fizurse and in another tale of count benjanisi into count benjamin which are probably wrought by typographic diablerie at the conclusion of the volume we ask ourselves if the peer can have renewed his youth by the publication of some early stories by the commonert1he jamaica rebellion of i 865 is an almost forgotten story which ails ricks promise george routledgc and

succeeded in presenting in a readable volume a great deal of information as to african discovery beginning with sataspes and hanno and ending with livingstone it is well nowadays that the labours and discoveries of the portuguese and english explorers should be kept in view lest the modern travellers loom too large in the foreground and obscure the mighty past of african discovery the wornout theme of the mutineers of the bounty has been taken up anew by mr r m ballantyne in the loney island james nisbet and co by the binding together of the wellknown facts with  the merest spiderweb of

inflictions both by their illustrations and their literary contents the tales which mr alberg has translated from the swedish original of richard gustaffson belong to the ever welcome fairytale order though they are not to be reckoned among the oldfashioned folk lore rose leaves and chit chat by puck swan sonnenschein and allen are rather we think suited for young old folks than young little folks

country of new guinea we can only regret that there has been hardly any space accorded to the history of the spice islands and the later conquest of java amid the wonders of nature and the accurate descriptions of the various races there would have been room for some account of the massacre of amboyna and of lord mintos expedition which transferred for the tine the rich dutch colonies to the possession of england the same publishers have issued a new edition of california and its wmonders which has been revised and brought down to the present time so at least we are told on the titlepage but we think that the account of the produce of the pacific silver mines is hardly up to the present yield there are fairly good illustrations to assist the verbal descriptions of the natural wonders of caleveras and the yosemite valley the astonishing productiveness of the soil assisted by the climate of california is briefly but clearly noted the work will serve as an introduction to the closer

confusing one in unpractised hands of a series of connected stories told by different actors in the drama the heroine is a jewess whom a young irish nobleman marries and prac tically deserts so that she is literally left to starve and perishes in a vain pilgrimage to establish her own and her childs rights we would remind the authoress that earlscourt is not an imaginary title there are some powerful descriptions but the story is confused and hopelessly improbable the nephews and nieces to whom 7he necklace of ptincess fiorimonde macmillan and co is dedicated may be congratulated on miss de morgans talent for telling fairy stories there are six others in the tasteful volume lit up by walter cranes illustrations the cruelty and punishment of the beautiful but hardhearted princess are well relieved by the exquisitely pathetic story of  arasmon and chryseia there is a purpose worth seeking in these tales which is patent enough in  the bread of discontent  and  the pedlars pack but

shakespeares philosophy and ethics apart from the machinery of his plays and poems the book is in fact a shakespeare concordance a register of his maxims views and sentiments on more than 500 subjects arranged alphabetically under headings thus if we look up u appetite1 a passage from cymbeline assures us that it is the best sauce for food  and if we look up  mustard  we find a quotation from midsummer nights dream to the effect that is is good with beef and makes the eyes water apart from its ambitious title and aim mr morgans volume is a largo collection of quotations from shakespeare and the passages are in most cases long enough to be interesting tales of nethercourt by the rev h c adams routledge is a book for boys full of the glories disgraces and ambitions of schoolboy life

dress and her puffed sleeves is bewitchingly lovely while the archtyrant looks dreadfully severe in a faustlike scarlet costume with his big keys athis waist but the most admirable conception in the book is  sister anne the importance of whose role our artists have hitherto failed to recognise doubtless fatima was charming but we have always felt that sister anne was the superior character and hitherto like many heroic women she has had all the work and none of the play mr walter crane however has made her full compensation by giving her a grecian profile and mounting her on the battlements

consulted all the best authorities on his subjects and has produced a very readable and useful book hymns and poems for little folks cassell petter and galpin is a delightful volume for nursery reading and contains as many pictures as poems to those who want as much paint as possible for their money we recommend the national nursery book an illustrated selection of known fairy tales and

and tlowers for the dinnertable and drawingroom the illustrations are remarkably graceful and the volume is sure to be a favourite giftbook although the subject seems scarcely suitable to the present time of year we recommend thc christmas volume of the peep show strahan and co as deserving especial notice it is a cheap and lively serial for young people and its illustrations as well as ita letterpress are above the average of juvenile serials the goalen harp album routledge a book for children of all ages is a collection of stories and verses beautifully printed and contains 150 excellent illustrations by watson pletach and ilertzel the works of canova with biographical memoir by count cicognara chatto and windusthis large volume one of the very largest of the christmas books contains a very complete illustration of the genius of canova outline engravings however carefully executed cannot tell much of the quality of sculptureits beauty of workmanship or magic of lifebut they can present fairly enough the scope and height of an artists invention that is what is very fully done for canova in the present volume by the aid of these severe outlines that avoid both the trials and the triumphs of more complete realisation we are able to judge fairly enough of the quality of the italian sculptors imagination we see the extremes of strength and tenderness which he could command and note the variety no less than the limitation of his genius we use the word genius for no one who has studied any of canovas works would be disposed to doubt that he was a very genuine artist whose sympathy with the antique ideal was always sincere if not profound we cannot too often remind ourselves that the greek art known to students of the second half of the last century was a thing very different from the greek art that we bow down before today there is scarcely a greater difference between michael angelos sculpture and that of canova than there is between the elgin marbles and the medicean venus and to the eighteenth century the medicean venus was the type of the antique in finding for this type a new expression in modern sculpture canova showed a very just appreciation of the value of his model the lighter grace of later greek art is translated without serious loss into the elegant forms fashioned by his own chisel nor is his a mere cold reproduction of the original there is a new element in the forms he created which gave them a real hold upon the admiration of the time that affectionate tenderness always taking graceful utterance which is so entirely characteristic both of his epoch and of his own work is enough in itself to prove that canova had reshaped for himself tie material of greek art and had so far truly assimilated its spirit as to be able to stamp it with his own individuality and if proof were needed that the artists taste was true and unborrowed it would be found in the immediate recognition which he accorded to the elgin marbles  i introduced canova first to the marbles writes hamilton in a letter to the painter haydon  and i never shall forget his attitude of astonishment and delight when gazing upon them as if they were really motionless living figures and when he said  oh that i were a young man and had to begin again i should work on totally different principles from what i have dope and form i hope an entirely new school this admiration of the greatest product of greek art truly and spontaneously offered is not unlike the praise lavished by reynolds upon michael angelo and although it was no doubt absolutely sincere in both yet neither approached in his own work to the qualities of the ideal reynoldss domestic grace was in fact closely allied in essence to the affectionate tenderness of canovas nude forms both men were entirely in sympathy with the temper of their time and both would have equally failed had they attempted to realise what they perceived to be of higher significance besides the outline engravings the present volume has an interesting memoir by the count cicognara and full descriptions of the various subjects engraved among warne nnd cos publications we have two little volumes of old and new testament illustrations by the rev hobart gaunter dd two pretty little stories entitled  the basket of flowers  and  the story of the robins from the  home circle series  and a

forms a serial story in it while the names of hans andersen george macdonald henry kingsley miss cupples and tom hood appear on the titlepage its illustrations are plentiful and good and we cordially recommend the book to christmas purchasers baron bruno and other fairy tales by louisa morgan macmillan is the prettiest collection of stories we have seen for a long time one and all are graceful and dreamy little prosepoems with something of the bewitching pathos of hans andersens little mermaid and eleven swans the authoress has blent the real and fantastic very cleverly the tates of greybearded german sceptics ardent young sculptors pretty little princesses and peevish monarchs are interwoven with the fates of starborn goddesses ocean beauties virtuous fairies and evil seakings aud the chief charm in the book is the way in which these mystic beings are for the time in spite of their wings and halos and scaly tails endowed with warmth and breath and are full of human gladness and sorrow it is to be regretted that the book is written in language scarcely simple enough for children even of twelve or thirteen years old in childrens books and in fairybooks especially there ought to be scarcely a wordwhich cannot be easily understood by a child of ordinary intelligence wherever there are two words to be had the more homely should be chosen even though it be less pretty than the other for very often what is eloquence to us is gibberish to children  and though perhaps in this case an authors vocabulary be curtailed yet the simplicity gained is a beauty in itself and the gratitude of his little readers an ample reward for his trouble but the present volume will find readers who are no longer children and who will appreciate its go od points without stumbling long over its long words the little boys own book lockwood and co is a chubby little volume containing hints and directions for every  kind of sport and pastime imaginable it is furnished with numerous engravings and would be a very good book if the type were not so terribly small if such books as these continue to be published there will soon be a demand for lilliput spectacles merry tales for little folk edited by madame de chatelain lockwood and co is an excellent collection of wellknown ballads and fairy tales and if people will have the old dishes cooked up every christmas they cannot have a better bill of fare than this  both mrs guernseys books purport to be chronicles of the stuart period and the dialogue is appropriately archaic not only in language however but in plot and characters is there the closest similarity between the two both the heroines are governesses in a noble family where there is a sickly child called betty who has disease of the heart and requires perfect quiet in either case the governess is the ministering angel of the house and in either case she captivates the only eligible young man that the family can boast of equally jealous heartburnings are hereby caused to other claimants who think themselves better entitled it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these two books have been successively compiled from identical materials the latter being an improved and elaborated edition of the former  christmas books first article the tide of literature specially prepared for christmas seems to set in earlier and more heavily every year much of it of course is only called christmas literature because it is published about christmas time and because being particularly adapted for holiday use by its showy bindings and profuse illustrations as well as by the lightness of the writing that is between the covers and the pictures it is thus thrown by the publishers into the competition by which bookbuyers and presentmakers are iemp to cater for their children and their friends at the most giftmaking time of the year the bookseason has now fairly begun and the weeks orer0htm ef mainly devoted to the publication of the lighter sorta of books most of which are as good reading in pnngtime and summertime as during the winter holidays today we shall notice more or less briefly a score of these books first in the list may be placed mr daws picture by charles robert leslie virtue containing steel gra of nine of the artists most characteristic picturs  with a compreheve description and with a tolerably f u j memoir as an introduction to the series mr dafforne overestimates leslie and some of the engravers have done him great injustice by their slipshod treatment of their subjects the volume as a whole however makes an attractive drawingroom ornament and is not merely oma mental it illustrates a phase in the history of english art and fairly shows what sort of an artist leslie was it opens with his  sancho and the duchess which was one of his earliest studies though this particular picture waa not painted till 1844 and ends with his charming  olivia nearly his latest production of the other pictures here copied the best engraved are  sancho panza a florisel and perdita  uncle toby and the widow wadman and  falstaff and his friends the last named being by far the best in the volume christmas carols new and old novello of which the bev h b bramley has edited the words and dr stainer the music and which contains fiftytwo pictures as well aa tunes to the fiftytwo carols is a disappointing volume most of the illustrations are poor and though much care haa evidently been taken in collecting the best carols and some of these will be new to nearly every one who nsea the book we should have preferred greater accuracy in the reproduction of both tunes and words the delightful old carol beginning joseph was an old man and an old man was he and he married mary queen of galilee for instance is needlessly mangled though it is quite true that to suit the prudish tastes of the day one or two verses might properly have been altered mr bramley however does not mend matters by writing as they went awalking in the garden ao gay maid mary spied cherries hanging over yon tree for as joseph and mary walked through the garden gay where the cherries they grew upon every tree and he sins more gravely than in this verse hans andersens tales are always favourites and every child who is lucky enough to possess the selection of hia fairy tales sampson low and co that mr ward and miss plessner have newly translated is to be congratulated the series consists of eight stories  the wild swans the ugly duckling and the snow queen being among the number the volume is illustrated by several colourprinted illustrations from e v bs drawings some of which are very good indeed in pictures of this sort the colours are generally so thick and coarsely laid on that all artistic merits are hidden and some of the illustrations in this volume are thus injured  but others are very successful especially the sketch of  the old woman with cuckoo shortlegs and the cat who wouldnt associate with the ugly duckling that of  children playing in the water alarmed by one of the mermaids approaching the shore and that of  the old witch combing gudas hair with a golden comb to make her forget her friend there are several other and less gorgeous volumes with coloured illustrations intended for small children chimes and rhymes for youthful times routledge is a collection of generally poor verse fitted to a great number of illustrations by oscar pletsch who is always good many of these however appeared last year in a volume entitled childlife and were then much prettier as plain woodcuts than here with their thick coatings of colour the favourite picture book for the nursery nelson contains fewer and bettercoloured if not better designed illustrations the pictures of the little man who had a little gun and went to the brook to hoot a little duck and of the little old woman who lived in a shell and whenever she wanted her tea got plenty of water from out of the sea are particularly good the only fault in this showy volume is that tonie of the rhymes facing the pictures are very silly a l 0 e picture story book nelson is not so well illustrated aad the prose stories contained in it are rather preey texte are freely sprinkled through them and the morale are spread over the tales instead of being tacked on at the end for wise children to skip the same authors sunday picture book nelson is better in every way it contains twentyeight short poems in which the religion is in place sketching the life of christ and the only faulty pictures are that of the  crucifixion with its ugly blotches of blood and that of the  resurrection suggestive of a pantomime tableau the book of the year for many children is a wonderful collection of household tales and fairy stories boutledge in which fortynine famous nursery favourites are supplied with three hundred and eighty pictures most of the pictures of course are old like the stories but they are none the worse for that seeing that mr harrison weir mr h k browne and mr gilbert are among the artists the stories have been well chosen and the series includes cinderella the sleeping beauty tom thumb little bopeep the five little pigs jack and the beanstalk and many other tales as good foremost among a heap of boys books before us is a new edition of robinson crusoe nelson reprinted from the first edition and supplied with a tolerably good life of defoe and with a hundred woodcuts many of which are capital for this very pretty volume some thousands of childrenand we are all children if it is childish to enjoy defoes masterpiecewill be thankful as a sort of companion to it we have another of mr w h g kingstons tales for boys which is also profusely and tastefully illustrated entitled on the banks of the amazon nelson it recounts the adventures of some boys who  after encountering various dangers in their journey over the cordilleras followed almost the same track as did the gallant gonzalo pizarro to the banks of the napo and thence descended the mighty amazon to the atlantic mr kingston wisely prefers to give plenty of adventure instead of working out an elaborate plot in his stories and he has a happy knack of mixing up a good deal of natural history with his narrative taking care that the mixture is pleasant as well as wholesome all this makes his books very interesting his ben burton sampson low and co is a tale of the sea shorter than  on the banks of the amazon and more of a regular story mr j t trowbridges jack hazard and his fortunes routledge is a smartlywritten and enjoyable account of the adventures of an erie canalboy who by honesty and enterprise worked his way up in the world we can do no more than name the hon charles murrays prairie bird routledge a north american indian tale and mr tom burgesss harry hopes holidays what he saw what he did and what he learned during a years ramble in country places routledge  the latter purporting to be stories that have no pretence to be aught but simple transcripts from the tablets of the past of some bright scenes and green spots on  memorys waste penned in the intervals of other labour but amid the dear scenes of our loved midengland among talewriters for girls the authoress of c when i was a little girl takes high rank nine years old macmillan is a sequel to that charming book and though it professes to be only the  little potatoes  of the writers childlife left behind when she dug up the larger ones and presented them to her readers last christmas it is a very acceptable dish whether the readers are nine years old or twice thrice four times five times six times or seven times as old they must enjoy this pretty volume who will not be glad for instance to hear more about grandmamma gower  the brightest merriest funniest old lady you ever saw who had very bright blue eyes and wore three little grey curls on each side of her face which shook about like silvery wings whenever she laughed or turned her head whose voice was  like a bell so bright and merry and musical and who  didnt make you feel like saying your prayers a bit  a book like this needs no other pictures than those that the authoress draws with her pen  but it aas a few very jolly woodcuts by mr frolich who when he does justice to himself hardly has a rival among artists of childlife mrs whitney writes for older children and for children trained to like religious sentimentalism and other things that should be shunned by all rightminded people but her real folks sampson low and co like her other books gives some insight into american life and is written with some literary ability the lady of provence or humbled and healed nelson is  a tale of the first revolution  by a l 0 e who in writing it has kept in view the story of naaraan the leper as being a striking type illustrative of an important scriptural doctrine we have classed this book among girls tales although one of its objects is  to lead masters and servants to feel that the connexion between employers and employed like every other social tie may be ennobled and strengthened by that faith which unites into one body all the ransomed people of god the same authoresss golden fleece nelson hardly a tale is meant to show that our good deeds must be judgedand few will bear the trial by our purity of motive and strength of selfdenial fourteen short stories by the same writer are collected in a little volume entitled the hymn my mother taught me and other stories nelson in aunt jennys american pets griffith and farran miss hopley gives much interesting information chatty and yet precise about the birds of the united states hummingbirds thrashers yellowbirds and ever so many more it is unkind of her however to put naughty thoughts into little boys heads by describing the cruelties that she says the young negroes are fond of practising upon any birds that come in their way and the mischief her description may do is not mended by her  try not to think of it dear children  christmas books weills village tales from alsatia 1 admirably translated from the german by sir alexander duff gordon comes very fitly at the head of our third batch of christmas books thb collection which originally appeared in the feuilleton of a strasburg newspaper exhibits somewhat painfully but we apprehend with much truth the harsh realities of peasant life in the district to which it pertains according to the authors own showing there are in al sa tia abundant materials for the happiness of a race whose country is fertile and whose social condition is far from unenviableno vexatious interference with civil or religious liberty existing  but to picture an arcadia docs not seen to have been the bent of his inclination he has chosen for his theme the vices and the frailties which are dependent on no particular locality but are common to all the world yet in treating his subjectsand this with considerable ability he has not failed so to interweave his incidents with the customs and habits of a people rarely described as by the force of local colouring to invest them with a strong interest apart from that which the story itself imparts the tales in the volume arc only three in number there is among other pictures a good characteristic illustration of selmel the crazy girl and her ton suitor  and the translation as is customary with sir a d gordon shows a perfect acquaintance with the colloquialisms and niceties of the germnn tongue and flows as easily as if it were the language in which the tales were originally written the heroic life and exploits of siegefried tke dragon slayer 2 with illustrations by kaulbach and printed in the square form and legible quaint type of a century and a half ago is a book for midsummer dreaming as well as christmas reading it will send back young and old to the grand times of heroic personal adventure when the age of chivalry itself was but beginning these exploits of siegefried form a fragment of the niebelungenlied that celebrated cycle of the romance of early germany the narrative is told in a clear vigorous style as if every sentence were meant to tell like one of the heros swordstrokes  but its simplicity by no means takes away from the effect of the marvels related kaulbachs illustrations are in excellent keeping the juvenile verse and picture book 3 profusely adorned with marginal and other illustrations in the style and good taste peculiar to mr burriss publications and admirably engraved on wood makes also a

and as we should think from personal observation parents and guardians ought to be obliged to mrs henry wood for her tale of william allair or running away to sea which is well calculated to induce boys who are well off on shore to remain so yet it is written in no spirit of antipathy to the sea and sailors the lad who goes against his parents inclinations is shown to have a hard time of it and a miserable end but harry vane who is an affectionate dutiful youth has a happy and prosperous career the tale leaving him a lieutenant in the royal navy whilst william allair dies in an indian

object being to amuse and instruct little girls the pupils occupy a more prominent place in the narrative than the teacher and their little troubles and pleasures are portrayed with much vividness and truth to nature the style is clear and attractive and a good moral tone pervades the story and leaves a wholesome impression on the mind of the reader busy hands and patient hearts or the blincl boy of dresden from the german of gustan niert1z jackson 1w alford  hodder there is no mistake as to the charming style of german tales which germans alone can write with the simplicity which so much interests children the first chapter in which little magda comes early in the morning to master tanzer the potter with a broken cup to have mended is enough to seal the character of the rest and we promise our young friends that they will not be content until they dive into the other chapters and read of the blind boy the hard landlord and the merry christmas with all the other exciting but instructive incidents of the volume which is one we can without hesitation recommend fireside chats with the youmgsters by old merry jackson walford c5 hodder this is a series of tales for boys old merry has made them his favourites and does not condescend to amuse the girls each chapter is a chat on a separate subject but the chat is all on one side as mr merry like most storytellers is fond of spinning a yarn and monopolising the conversation to himself he tells his young hearers of  boys without hearts shams and mir braggadocio grumblers and building castles in the air also about fairies who are people that are constantly doing good a few words even about  giants old merrys efforts will we have no doubt afford amusement to his youthful hearers the history of poor match by holme lee smnith elder t co this is a tale of doglifeas worthy any day as a tale of a doll or of a cat or even as  the tale of a tub as petdogs often occupy a foreground in the daily amusements of young people

canterbury pilgrims of 1388 from the best manuscripts and designs available to herexcept lord ellesmeres and the cambridge university ms both in the hands of the chaucer societyand has given in chaucers words and modern rhyme his description of his fellowtravellers together with five of his tales best suited for young readers the knights tale of the fight between palamon and arcite for emilies love the clerks tale of grisilde and her uncomplaining sorrow the friars tale of how the wicked summoner was carried off to hell the franklins tale of the magic moving of the rocks of dorigen

directions for the pronunciation of chaucers english and versions in modern rhyme of all passages quoted from him a life of chaucer and a steel engraving from his pupil hoccleves portrait of him in the harleian ms 4866 make the book attractive as well as workable it must not only take a high place among the christmas and new year books of this season but is also of permanent value as an introduction to the study of chaucer whose works in selections of some kind or other are now textbooks in every school that aspires to give sound instruction in english mrs haweis has tried the experiment of teaching chaucer to her own little boy not only telling him the tales in ordinary mothers talk but reading him extracts from them in the pronunciation that our highest authority mr alexander j ellis has decided must have prevailed among educated englishmen in the fourteenth century she now asks other mothers to try the same plan with their boys and girls and feels certain that they will be able at once to interest and teach their children on her plan while though drawings of the old dresses the description of the old english pilgrims and their ways will stir the young folks interest in the history of their homes and land in a way which catalogues of kings of israel or details of battles statecraft and the like can never do and surely those who know chaucer his roguish fun his love of nature birds and books his fresh boys heart his care to teach lewys his  lytel sone must feel that there is in him very much to draw children to him and they will be glad at least to try whether mrs haweiss pretty book from the daisies on its cover to its  notes on the pictures  at the end a labour of lovewill not bring their little ones some of the sunshine and pleasure that the

occupied by the anglonavarrese from 1356 to 1364 which the author has added to his book offers the double advantage of throwing a great and melancholy light on the general situation of the country and

for the kind of art and literature that it offers ha9 for the most part departed with the round table the poetry howeverwe can say this for itis not original as sometimes happens in books of this kind

that young maidens will delight in who have not yet reached the advanced period when they like sauces with their food and a spice of sensation in their novels this period unfortunately arrives at the present day very early and to juvenile readers of miss braddon ouida rhoda broughton and others such a book as mildreds mistake which deals simply with the wellregulated loves of four very nice and wellbehaved young ladies will doubtless seem rather tame but those who like fair amoret have been carefully  trayned up from time to time in all chaste virtue and true bountihed but who yet are beginning to find that there are questions for them to answer of even deeper consequence than those set by the local examiners will be likely to find much to interest and even guide them in their budding womanhood in this  stilllife study even the little gilt medallion of a pair of modern lovers on the cover is a model of respectful courtship memoirs of a poodle translated yy mrs sale barker routledge a very intelligent poodle whose memoirs are fully as interesting as and less scandalous than those of many human poodles who have left us similar autobiographical records our present

families in whose homes a mild religious atmosphere prevails and who celebrate christmas chiefly as a high festival of the church will doubtless find this pretty giftbook wherein the story of the

of l diefenbach are weakly reminiscent of the early italian masters kaspar and the seven wonderful pigeons of wiirzburg by john goddard marcus ward a pleasant german variation of the theme of alice in wonderland instead of the usual parodies on wellknown verses children are here given a translation of riickerts tender little poem  the strangerchilds holy christ but the sympathetic tears that this may bring into their eyes at starting will soon be dried by the delightful fun that followsfun without any furtive attempt at imparting useful knowledge the  ancient grofulus  is of the genus bandersnatch but the spinning princess is of the genuine old fairytale stock and so beautiful that plenty of little boys we imagine besides kaspar will fall in love with her wise little linda with her firm belief in her brothers marvellous adventures is also very charming  thank you good pigeons for the pleasant hours you have given us is what many other little dreamers besides kaspar and linda will say this christmas annies pantomine dream by else j davis moxon this is one of the numerous stories to which alice in wonderland has given rise it is in fact a remarkably close copy of that now classic work only in the present book a perfidious counsellor named knowledge is ever present among the dramatis personae whispering and insinuating scraps of moral advice and scientific information clever children will quickly find out and resent his presence as they do that of the powder artfully concealed in jam the complaints of the coinage are amusing but we do not wonder that the other

about feline animals seeley the clan of the cafs includes not only the familiar members of catland proper but such distant foreign relatives as the leopard the lynx the panther the jaguar the ounce the ocelot the tiger the puma and the lion the acknowledged chief of the clan so that an acquaintance with puss really involves a considerable knowledge of natural history the book is illustrated with thirtyfive woodcuts many of them very good and the stories are simply told and are sure to please intelligent children public and private life of animals sampson low translated from a french work published some ten or twelve years back which owes its popularity to the admirable illustrations of legrand which are here reproduced his spirited groups of animals and the human expression he has contrived to give to their faces are perfectly inimitable fairyland tales and legends from the german of villamaria marcus ward the story of the  kings daughter derives its source from the fate of pharaohs host which according to scandinavian legend found no rest in the depths of the red sea but were changed into seals and sent to though cold waters of the north the superstitious reverence in which the ladybird is held in germany and the tyrol is told in the story of  holdas paradise and many other popular legends gleaned from old chronicles will prove a welcome christmas offering in their

mill by captain rice re hatchards a story for people from sixteen to twenty years of age the beginning is dull but the tale though an improbable one improves as it goes on it is the history of a young

new south wales to whom he was engaged in happier days she faints as he in his capacity of cabinbay hands her a bowl of strawberry ice c kc the boole is crudely written but wellintentioned and

the old times of a kovalists and roundheads including the sieges of bristol i p and colchester it is a tale of the kentish insurrection is the author who describes himself ia a short preface as an j p indian official fairly states that he has drawn his history from  ti no more recondite sources than carlyles life of cromwell and mr warburtons rupert but the story has sufficient j li interest to make the embodiment of the historical knowledge  ai so obtained a very tolerable novel the other of the novels i a to be mentioned is entitled broomhill or the countyi beauties 9 wherein he or she who

always for the furtherance of generous and worthy ends and having set before herself a modest and just ambition to become trusted as a graceful writer and a truehearted woman among readers of her own sex she has here written in an unstrained simple way a tale interesting in itself and womanly and pure in purpose the tale is especially adapted as a quiet little gifthook for young ladies who have passed their childish years for younger ladies or for boys who like to read the story of a girl there has been written a pleasant little volume entitled ashbell ll by miss hooper it is a very wellwritten story with a few illustrations by which it will be made further palatable to the young people who are to feast on its contents another attractive and very appropriate book for the young readers of a family is a story of the russian campaign translated from the german an historical novel on a small scale entitled the little drummer 12 it has four illustrations of more than average merit and is one of those books which boys and girlsbut boys especiallywhen they begin will probably not consent to be taken from very easily another of these small historical novels of which the story is connected with the french revolution of 1848 is adolphe benouard 13 a stirring tale which has the benefit of being very copiously illustrated it is the pictorial christmas tale issued from the office of messrs ingram and cooke pictures of a higher classthough those last mentioned were excellentwill be found in a childbook called adventures of a bear 14 which contains some illustrations that do credit to the pencil and the humour of a most skilful animal painter mr harrison weir  there is also much of grace  and good taste in the designs by mr hablot brown which adorn mrs harriet

must be our excuse a neat little book containing a popular account of comets 24 by as sound authority as mr hind will certainly be chosen by a good many who seek giftbooks for though young the subject of comets is as wonderful and full of interest even to many ofthe young as any fairy tale we name this volume therefore among christmas books we might almost add to it the german conversation book 5 of mr bernays founded as it is upon the happy plan of substituting for the dull dialogues of the old school dialogues of an amusing kind fitly selected from the german drama or wo might add among our christmas books the account of iwchew and the jjcwcheuans 2g by the bishop cf victoria which while it pleads for the support of missionaries supplies at the same time details that would interest the whole juvenile community if any christmas book should be demanded on the subject of the duke of wellington mr bohn is ready to supply the want a life of wellington 27 digested from the materials of

upward on its wing both the public and the press 80 completely as to set afloatt all the literature of popular science that is now in vogue we are not able to say but there can be no doubt that that work and the others of the series are both pleasant and instructive reading and many will thank mr davenport adams for translating and mr skelton for illustrating the last of the four tile llzuntaia nelson m michlelet writes fancifully if not fantastically the chief characteristic of his books being as he says that  they attempted not to give a meaning of their own to nature but to penetrate hers they loved her and they questioned her from every creature they demanded the secret of its little soul philosophers must decide whether each mountain has its  little soul and whether the earth which for present purposes is made up altogether of mountains has a heart an allpowerful organ in which its energies are made manifest by which it aspires and respires and palpitates in all its many transformationsa heart with two lobes one of which is  the burning belt of islands over which java holds supremacy and the other 1 the boiling cauldron of cuba and haiti in the meanwhile m michelet as a prose poet answers these questions in the affirmative his talk is very pretty and it has one advantage at any rate that it helps him to inculcate kindly views and to impress useful facts upon the memory where more sober writers might fail the mountain id easy reading and mr skeltons fifty chaming woodcuts go far to make it one of the most attractive giftbooks that have been published this year in our ipoor rlations described as a  pbilozoic essay blackwood colonel liamley makes smaller claim upon our imagination in calling upod us to recognise in animals if not souls as good as our own at any rate o0la human enough to entitle them to kindly treatment at our hands the text of the delightful little volume though placed in its middle is an oriental fable which represents the various animals as assembling to consider the cause of all their woes and of the raven clinching the controversy by saying my friends what we are seeking lies under our very noses i perceive what this evil is and how futile will be all attempts to propitiate it for it is clear that man insatiate man is our devil  this work not too long to be read in halfanhour is a chrisnmasbook of the best sort preaching the gospel of kindness to aniimials and denouncing the wanton cruelty that goes by the name of sport it has several humorous and appropriate illustrations by al griset if the illustrations are the best part of iau1tifudlrieids in farof lands nelson the writing by misses mary and elizabeth kirby is very good in its way these ladies who have already written for children about  the world at home and the sea and its wonders here furnish half a hundred short and interesting chapters concerning the gay birds of the tropics the hues and features of which are made very apparent by a series of remarkably good coloured pictures nearly as well illustrated with colourprinted plates and of kindred sort though intended for rather oller readers are curiosities of entomolboy groowbridge and mr 1i

profusely illustrated many of the pictures being printed in colours the literary bouquet nimmo is a gathering of pictures and extracts of a sort now rather out of fashion the former claiming to be  of a high order and the latter designed to be  a bunch of neverdying flowers culled from a few of the thousand and one gardens of british poetry and prose some of the woodcuts are good but the letterpress is not always well chosen even shelleys  skylark and wordsworths  lucy and bumss auld lang syne can be quoted too often as the volume contains but one extract from dickens and four  neverdying flowers  from dr collier and five from mr davenport adams we are tempted to guess that one of the two lastnamed  favourite authors is its compiler the work however modestly disclaims for

our table and secreted in the nursery there to be devoured at leisure by a small critic who found in it a solution of the old impossibility of eating a cake and having it too this is lady bark rs best book it gossips in the pleasantest way possible about the christ mas experiences in england jamaica india and new zealand of a lady who certainly must be the authoress who used to be constantly surrounded by boys and girls in a chronic state of storyhunger but who fortunately i never seemed to tyre of telling all that they wanted to hear the stories here told consist mainly of illustrations of emigrant and native customs in the colonies and are all very interesting and save for an cccasional touch of horror very wholesome mr lewis carrolls through t le lookingglass and what alice found there macmillan is a sort of sequel to  alices adventures in wonderland and though hardly as good as that altogether delightful book is quite good enough to delight every sensible reader of any age it tells with wit and humour that all children can appreciate and grown folks ought as thoroughly to enjoy how alicein a dream as she afterwards found outbroke through the drawingroom lookingglass to look at the furniture that was the reverse of all that was around her and then entered upon a series of wonderful adventures among red kings and white queens and all the people of the chessboard saw funny things without number met with humpty dumnpty and other wonderful people and heard and herself sang queer songs of all sorts and the best of all is that the book has no moral and is nothing but a capital jumble of fun from boston we have in 2mfother gooses melodies for the nursery sampson low and co a very complete alphabetical collection of the good old nursery rhymes with the various english readings and some american adaptations with critical and historical notes chiefly taken from mr halliwells nursery rhymes and popular rhymes with musical accompaniments to many of them and with some very humorous and artistic illustrations by mr henry l stephens and mr gaston fay the rioyal illuminated book of legends nimmo contains cinderella and the fair one with the golden locks each told in verse by mr francis davis and mr tennysons  sleeping beauty with gorgeous illustrations by mr marcus ward in antique style and printed in colours and gold there is quaint humour in the pictures and each story is supplied with music arranged or composed by mr b h carrol each is also issued as a separate book as nursery books very fairly illustrated there have been published the three little kittens the three white kittens the three good friends and our fourfooted friends nelson the same publishers have also issued four packets of colourprinted cards one containing a picture alphabet another bible animals another birds of the bible and another garden flouwers the first are well fitted to entice small children into learning their letters and the last are really artistic productions in cramers christmas carols we have a very cheap collection of music quite appropriate to the season fourteen carols some of them old enough to be novel are here brought together with the original melodies or with good and easy settings by fresh hands where there are no old tunes to be used   christmas books i to the list of richly illustrated gift books is now to be added mr octavius rookes life of the moselle 1 an account of the river written pleasantly well studded with legends and adorned with many little pictures engraved from original drawings by the author mr planche though we bave from him no christmas extravaganza still pays homage to the genius of the time in la former year he translated afresh and edited the fairy tales of the countess danois he now collects into a

leprince de beaumont madlle de lubert and others there are fourandtwenty tales in the collection all translated fairly and completely in an appendix we are told something about their authors and about some of the tales themselves we are delighted to find on the authority of mr planche that we may safely believe in the glass slipper of cinderella that emendation of fur slipper pantoufle de vair was

green and comr knatchbulliiugessen dedicates his little books to the silent members of the house of commons and takes this opportunity of eulogising their unselfishness in abstaining from speech and allowing the business of our representative assembly to proceed he inscribes it to them he tells us becausein the tirst place its title admirably describes the condition in which the business of the house usually is and also because the stories themselves were written within the precincts of the house it is apparently mr hugessens custom to sit in the gallery during those debates to which he does not care tc listen and in this retreat to conjure up for himself a temporary utopia of fairies goblins mermaids prophetic pigs and all the rest of his puppets this pleasant occupation is interrupted only when the division bell tinkles  and mr hugessen bids goodbye to dreamland just in time to record his valuable vote whether he confounds fairy tales and politics on these official occasions we know not but it is to be remarked that a very decided political vein runs through the whole of his fairy stories perhaps it is his design to supply politics and satire for  everybody and pigs and squirrels for  everybodys children   but we cannot help thinking that his senior readers will show little interest in the pigs while the little ones will object to the solitics how can children be expected to understand mr inatchbulliiugessens admirable witticisms concerning poaching the game laws publicans and county magistrates his funny little allusions to school boards to church controversies and to wifebeating  his sounding but not very navel remarks concerning female suffrage and his little squibs at charitable institutions  a not very pleasant feature of the book is the jocular and rather unchivairic tone in which it speaks of women we object especially in a book intended for children to the use even in fun of the words  female and petticoat for  woman and to the systematic bringing out in clear relief of all the little frailties and foibles of the weaker sex which a witty  stronger vessel  can manage to gather together the book is nevertheless clever and amusing and a great improvement upon mr hugessens last christmas volume its matter is more interesting in itself and its style is simpler and pleasanter though its author still indulges in too many long words and still  takes as we once heard a juvenile critic say of him  a very long time to say a very little thing1 among the many contents of every boys annual routledge for this christmas may be mentioned a complete nautical story by jules verne a series of papers on  modern magic  winch explain many popular and startling tricks and will atford infinite amusement to boys though we confess to thinking it no very desirable addition to the recreations of a wellregulated household we must mention also a spirited serial continued throughout the volume entitled  the original robinson crusoe by the rev h c adams which is the history of the adventures of alexander selkirk gathered from existing and authentic records little folks cassell petter and galpin is a new and admirable magazine for children of all sdrts aud sizes with pictures considerably above the average of ordinary storybook illustrations the  little folk  themselves are invited to try their best in contributing to their magazine letters stories and poems and every prizeletter is rewarded by a handsome book the wild horseman of thc pampas by david ker il s king is a thorough boys book and recounts a boys adventures in south america written in some cases from personal experience it is rather too full of such boys rhetoric as beastly  topping slick my eye and lark but it is on the whole well written and likely to be a favourite tell me a story by ennis graham macmillan is a volume specially adapted for small children who will delight in its woodcuts and in its simple and homely phraseology its author sympathises thoroughly with all the tiny joys aud woes of the nursery domain thc young surveyoi low and co is a story of american life and manners and those not of the most refined kind it abounds in yankee dialect and survey measurements and we hear of  perdickerments  clar soapgrease  theodolites  transitinstruments and  doggoneations whatever they may be the illustrations are so bad that they might have been executed with the surveying instruments of its own hero it is a lamentable fact that our storybooks are illustrated as a rule much better by foreigners than by englishmen french drawings careless as they often are have a spirit a drollery and a grace peculiarly their own but the quaint careful cleanlycut german illustrations are always the greatest favourites with children who will pass over any amount of french wit or sentiment to admire the stolid back of a little german babys head the volume of chatterbox for 1875 gardner contains its usual supply of amusing and wellwritten stories the illustrations are less than usually artistic but it is to be supposed that small readers are not hypercritical and that for them a very little suggests a great deal on this account a juvenile journal cannot be too plentifully illustrated even where the pictures are of the roughest and most commonplace kind so long only as the artist contrives to suggest ever so dimly what is in itself beautiful and good at the same time now that some of our best artists condescend to illustrate childrens books the older folk who buy these books are becoming more fastidious and our children will not be long in following their example thc childrens prize gardner another serial contains some pretty music with words which children will easily learn to sing sunday heading for the young gardner is a combination of amusement and instruction which reminds us of the dose of physic hidden in jam which most sensible children strongly object to its cover is characteristic a vindictive little old lady in spectacles is represented in red and blue hearing a small girl con her sunday lesson while at her elbow stands the naughty boy looking extremely uncomfortable in a fools cap we thought that the day for such trash as this had long since passed by little wideawake routledge is a collection of stories and verses for children the print is largea great point in juvenile booksthe pictures are in some cases extremely graceful but the verses might be better mrs sale barkers book is likely to be a favourite with her little readers the modern playmate warne and co contains the rules and modes of playing every game which is in vogue in the present day besides many that are new or forgotten there are chapters also on archery boating sailing shooting fishing swimming skating and pedestrianism we have playground games games in the snow outdoor games indoor games and games specially adapted for winter evenings at home among thee last may be reckoned charades of which there are given two very elaborate specimens or models the volume is full of amusing matter and will be found extremely useful as a holiday handbook national natural history warne and co is a collection of pictures and notes of animal life the print is excellent the notes are short and readable and will with their coloured illustrations amuse children as well as instruct them the plays for children by miss walker routledge include five plays two only of which are original the rest being taken from hans andersen and grimm these last are not close translations and it is a pity that miss walker has been obliged to add so much dreary dialogue in the process of dramatising the old stories ju doing so she has converted pretty simple tales into dull and spiritless plays but although tiny are scarcely lively enough to tempt children to learn thin by heart and to act them they will be read with pleasure an1 may help to illustrate for small students the dramatic lona in literature  christmas

of the group of the foolish virgins against whom the bridegrooms door is shut and mr millais is at his best also in his illustration of the parable of the good samaritan and 1 that of the lost sheep or of the prodigal son we have by no means equal regard for all the designs but the work is beyond doubt full of the noble thought of an artist who4 has the true gift of genius to spend upon a theme of which i he feels with all his heart the dignity in such books lies the best worth and honour of our christmas literature an edition like this of mr millais illustrations to the parables is not only a credit to the publisher it is a credit to the country at the head of the childrens storybooks for christmas 1863 we are glad to be able to place a cheap edition of the storybook of storybooks the arabian nights bntertainment 2 somewhat abridged and cleared of those passages which in the eyes of judicious parents are to the young a stumbling block we never knew or heard of in the bygone generations of the young a child who read the real original arabian nights and found sensuality where judicious age finds eastern fancy over fervid but this generation of children is said to be precocious and our boys and girls are pronounced little men and women so perhaps they may not be invited to a bright revel of fancy with the old confident sense that to the pure all things are pure so be it the stories are here pruned skilfully by the hon mrs sugden not very much spoilt and therefore acceptable everywhere it is the business of every judicious man at this season to ascertain whether he has a nephew or niece son or daughter in so hopeless a state as never to have read the  arabian nights and to provde for the right education of all who are in that case by supplying copies we fear that there are many poor children in the land who know none of the stories of the barbers brothers and have never dreamed of prince camaralzaman or rubbed aladdins lamp unhappy creatures who have no better christmas hope than that papa twill buy them peter parleys annual 3 here it is the original parley is gone but his annual is edited by william martin author of the  holiday book illustrated

threeandsixpenny volume of his  illustrated library with the pictures by george cruikasban and ludwig grimm mrs t k hervey too is entitled to some thanks for endeavouring not unsuccessfully to provide children with a new christmas book containing some reminder of the substance and the spirit of arthurian romance the stories in her feasts of camelot and the tales that were told there 5 are too clearly modern antique to please the student of old literature have in fact no more flavour of king arthur than a tale of old time by the author of  mary powell is able to suggest other sort of talk than that which is conceived over the modern tea and muffin yet the child wiil be pleased and we are grateful to the lady who does not write parleywise but seeks to bring the bright tints of romance into the childs workaday life if it be true as we fear it is that many children even of the rich who might be better l cared for now live workaday lives and suffer by star 4 vation of their fancies perhaps less entertaining to a young child but more genuine romance of the old time is a transformation by mmr or miss emma letberbrow of the noble mediaeval german or north sea saga the song of the

warmest life and the dog lively and mischievous marches in front of the company with the little vulgar boy the enemy in sight it is very possible that some children may find a want of exciting incident or regularlyconstructed story and that the charm of the true picture of childlife is rather greater for the elders than for the children of a family but whether or not that be so this book about children and a pet dog that the old read throughout with a smile of pleasure must come near to the hearts of the young with whom the writer shows herself to be in such delightful sympathy the book is hardly to be called a tale but as a cheerful and true sketch from the child world it is one of the happiest and wholesomest little giftbooks of the asn and a book that may give an hour of

not think so the successful embellishment of standard literature or the illustration of works for particular objects scenie historical or scriptural are alone adapted for a competition of that kind christmas stories are peculiar to themselves and miss toulmin as a new competitor in this field has penned a truly beautiful domestic tale the story of a proud and wealthy man whose one son weds a governess and the other when at oxford gives away his heart to a lowly maid but both of whom are reconciled to their father by the partner of partners mr mierrythorpe the felicity of whose domestic lhearth is only rivalled by that of the discarded william hamilton  partners for life is we should think well adapted for the stage how mrs gorethe clever versatile mas gorecould write such a sad tale

explained in notes the divisions arc also illustrated by popular introductory comments and the separate poems often by biographical notes on the writer which may be of use to the young the editor himself never goes beyond popular knowledge of his subject is content for example to explain yule in a note by saying  yule is the anglosaxon for christmas when it would have been much more to the purpose to say that it was anglosaxon for  the merry festival the name geol pronounced yeol or yule was originally applied to both the great feasts of the year and is derived from gal merry yule therefore means not christmas alone but merry christmas now that its name is restrieted to that single feast but the slight annotation with which the christmas verses are introduced will be welcome enough to the young reader the collection is a pleasant one and the presentment of the volume very beautiful of mr birket fosters tinted illustrations it may be that none are new about a core of the

great good humour gives them a capital mixture of comical adventure and narrower than hairbreadth escapes so that the boy who reads may exercise his incredulity to the utmost while he is being amused and instructed the pictures match the text a hunted elephant charging a tree that has a negro king on the top of it has so many arrows in his hide that he looks like a christmas tipsy cake mr

of elephants lions tigers wolves bears and whatever else there may beferm nature there are also plenty of woodcuts scattered about the text which is no series of imaginary adventures but a lively compilation by mr james greenwood under the head of each beast that is hunted of what is most interesting to boys in the sporting adventures of the men who have distinguished themselves as its hunters there are portraits also of great hunters and the volume includes a map of each quarter of the globe showing in a popular way the distribution of animals over its surface for any boy with an interest in stories of the chase or in the history of all sorts of wild beasts this handsome volume of wild sports of the world will be a famous christmas box another seasonable boys book of adventure is

oldfashioned sort well told and illustrated striking pictures of african adventure form a part only of the range of incident the picture by mr keeley halsewelle of the executions from the baboon cliff is good enough almost to set a young heart throbbing very good too is the perilous adventure of a man lying on a ledge of precipice with bears advancing on him from above and from below the pictures which are all by mr halsewelle are not equal in merit but the power shown in one or two is beyond the common level a good storybook for girls is miss bowmans how to make the best of it routledge and

B9054,['6734679'],  the celtic twilight men and women dhoula and faeries by w b yeats lawrence  bullen it was math the magicianthe same math that formed the maiden blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today mr yeats is perhaps the one true follower of math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his in it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of oisin and cuchulain and if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his the celtic twilight will still remain to the saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and fairies will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before but to those who believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,storie

occupy a position which it is easy for them to defend and which it is difficult to assail to find fault with their wares is to advertise them and to expose the reviewer to the easy charge of prudery it often happens too that there is here and there a jewel hidden in the dunghills of the past some pure song among the many base ones of th6ophile vian some fact of historical value in the gossip of mrs aphra behn it is a pity that the student should not have such books always beside him as if the poorest student had not easy access to them in public libraries still there is this shadow of au excuse for many reprints of books which are meant to appeal only to prurient curiosity and when they are pro duced with some care and costliness in type and paper the chances are that they will not fall into the hands of readers whom they are likely to injure none of the excuses we have mentioned can be urged by the translator and the pub lishers of balzacs contes drolatiques the translator says in his preface in france the work has long been regarded as a classicas a faithful picture of the last days of the mayen dge when kings and princesses brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants in england the difficulties of the language employed and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the french of the sixteenth century taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages the archaeological value it must alwats possess for the student and the dramatic interest of its stories the translator has thought that an english edition of balzacs chef dceuvre would be acceptable to many no doubt it would and no doubt a translation of the marquis de sades chefdceuvres or of any other  scrofulous french novel would be acceptable to many but the translator like everyone else must be per fectly aware that the historical information of the book is absolutely worthless that it has no archaeological value at all except in the same sense as esmoncd has archaeological value that is as an imitation of the style and manners of the past and the style and lan guage of the contes drolatiques are not nearly so successful in this direction as esmond is the old french is like no old french in par ticular indeed it resembles nothing so much as the bastard old english of lady novelists who put ys for is and spell the ye and begin all the substantives with a capital letter there is no philological instruction to be got from this kind of thing and even if there were it would be lost in a translation to be sure the translator does his best by using some fine old examples of wellknown errors in english grammar such as  the wise man would lay at full length in a ditch to translate balzacs conte8 drolatiques then is inexcusable on historical or antiquarian grounds even beroalde de verville has the value of being the exponent of the nastiness of a past age but there is no historical value in a modern imitation of beroalde de verville and even if the cn ies were useful to the student a student so advanced ought to be able to read them in the original french nor has the book the excuse of being published at a price beyond the humblest purse or in a form meant to please the lover of beautiful typography it is got up like the boys books that are current at christmas and an illiterate but wellmeaning grand mother might probably give it to a boy now even the author would have objected to this for when balzac in the preface to the first edition defended his work as a work of art he also said that it was intended pour lea lecteura choiie the present translation appeals to the public at large to a public which has none of the education that would enable it to appreciate the art without taking harm from the grossness the contes drolatique is a fair example of the baser work of the romantic school of 1830 it deals with mediaeval themes and the author thoroughly enters into the horror and the lust which inform the grotesque of the middle ages in the voice and with a cracked imitation of the ringing laugh of rabelais he tells tales more filthy than any in the collection of the cure of meudon and morehateful in theircruelty than most that disgrace the records of crime in the middle ages theserecords are dreadful enough but they are at least human in their earnestness men were cruel because they were terrified but it is scarcely human to take such themes for art a gross age laughed grossly but there is something apish in the imitative and affected ribaldry of a refined age a cruel age acted with cruelty but there is something of the tiger in the artist who in a humane age gloats over torture like all balzac did his contes drolatiques are works of patient art look at the story of la succube it is a masterpiece of the romantic school the blind gropings of pedants in the mysteries of nature and of law are reproduced with the skill of michelet a glamour of moorish colour a savour of exotic fragrance hangs about the vampire but in place of the indignation of michelet there is only a sound of mocking laughter and everywhere in the book in every page we are reminded that this is the work of that balzac after reading whom saintebeuve said he felt like one unclean the book is full of art but to translate it for english people is to perpetrate another of the many crimes that are done in the name of art in this sabbat of satyrs and obscene witches among these foul scandals of monasteries and shadows of nameless sins there appears here and there the face of a woman that is not wholly vile or of a knight that was not merely a lecher but there is none of the tender poetry the pure love that redeem the coarseness of boccaccio the romantic school has scarcely produced a more hideous work or one so likely to do mischief in an english form the volume is illustrated with dores famous woodeuts now very worn and ob scure mr hamerton and mr ruskin did full justice to these drawings while they were still confined

have a certain continuity he has attempted to reproduce atmosphere it may be said without delay that northeast has achieved his end but another and to our mind a greater achievement is that he has

the general level of the work is excellent the semidetachment of mr wrens stories in  dew and mildew is apt to be a little bewildering he seems to have hesitated between a novel and a collection of short stories and finally to have fallen between the two giving the novel if anything a slight preference the same characters appear practically throughout the book which has as a background a series

and deleted the excrescences it is always pleasant to adventure with mr roberts into natures fastnesses and in the feet of the furtive he is singularly happy  moreover we can as we read congratulate

the exposure of a criminal archdeacon in  the stalls of barchester cathedral dr james has the art of inventing weird incidents one of his characters putting ahand under his pillow to get his watch

wasp creeping out of a rotten apple our authors antiquarianism is used sparingly but well it would be natural to say a good word for a volume of essays provided with so much food for meditation and philosophical mirth as is contained in among the idolmakers williams  norgate and by pouring his ideas into the mould of the short story mr l p jacks further increases our obligation  for though by choice too unconvincing wholly to subjugate healthy incredulity he amuses excites and awes his reader at will he is a philosopher in touch with the pith and core of human life and actualitya

against free will and determinism is as it were silenced by a screaming paradox mr jacks shows like other intellectual humorists lewis carroll for example that there is something festive about reason though few seem able to offer it as a feast admirable is our authors study of the effect of shock and disappointment on the mind of an apparently perfectly balanced academic type and it is followed by a clever description of a reformers paradise in which those whom the world calls cranks make a bizarre display of their theories somewhat tantalising and misty at the climax is a little spiritual biography named  a psychologist among the saints this story and the last encourage the idea of a superhuman directing hand or of fate the belief that the popular magazine has secured the monopoly of the short story driving the artist to the more  legitimate  modes of expression is largely fallacious the superstitious dread of being classed as  raconteurs which assailed many meritorious writers

werner laurie is a more ambitious venture for he discards the gay trappings of the farceur and attempts serious observation upon life he is not entirely successful in this new r61e because his irrepressible gaiety bursts its bonds indifferent to congruity his quiet facetiousness and irony cling round him where the utmost artistic repression is required the majority of the stories are of tragic intent and many of them are highly ingenious in construction they are told with a sure instinct for a storys sequence and rhythm the mechanism is well oiled and the touch upon the levers is light and flexible mr pain is an epicure in  situations and ho manoeuvres them with much adroitness and dexterity his humour has intact all its sly elvish flavour but somehow the cumulative effect fails he lacks the inevitability the wizardry of the true artist the common things of life he cannot touch into life he flounders in the more familiar watersand inconsequently relapses into his old capers with a naive indiscretion delightful in itself but fatal to the purpose of his story his shortcomings in tragedy are obvious in spite of some shrewd characterization  short stories a tirle

galsworthy exposes his lack of originality with this story may be paired a clever tale called the pack in which the simious imitativeness shown in ragging and mobbing is cleverly illustrated two

success in the wendigo a tale of a flying monstrosity which inspires horror and obedience simultaneously in the terror of the twins a story of diabolic power lodged in idiocy and surviving death to commit a shocking crime mr blackwoods talent is misapplied taken altogether the sketches of which sea dog8 eveleigh nash is composed are no t worthy of mr morley roberts perhaps the subtitle a set of seacomedies hamiered him or again and more probably he was handicapped by an influence which exercises pernicious sway with only too many modern writers the need of subservience to the persistently and unnecessarily banal standards which the editors of popular magazines apply to fiction the author makes no attempt to be funny in the last sketch of the collection and this is the best of the seven

B5970,"['3201000', '2437138', '9501831']",  lrovel lrotes justice of the peace by frederick niven 6s kvveieigu snafu this is the best piece of work that mr niven has yet done and though from his preface he seems to have taken too seriously the difficulties of writing his tale he has made a striking vivid thing out of it he talks about it being a family history that would naturally run to the length of gibbons  decline and fall  but in matter of fact it is a fairly concise study of a mother and son with the father hovering on the outskirts of the drama as a perplexed and saddened spectator of the strange struggle between his wife and boy in spite of the way he talks in his preface mr niven handles his story in a fine manner making it practically a biography of the son martin moir and leaving almost to the last chapter the explanation of an early incident in the lives of the father and mother which illumines the brilliant tragical tale seeing that it is the father who is  the justice of the peace and that he plays only a part of secondary importance in the novel the title of the work is somewhat misleading for it is on the artistic career of the son and on the strange vehement and embittered opposition which the mother manifests at every point of his career that the story turns from the time when martin moir begins to draw as a child in glasgow to the time when he returns to his native city an etcher of acclaimed genius mrs moir seeks to impede and denigrate his art she begins by denying his genius she goes on to defame his character and as a member of some purity league she practically charges him with being one of the men responsible for the degradation of models who sit for what trilby used to call the  altogether moir himself is a fine honest capable young fellow of sensitive temperament who loves his mother with a deep passion and his struggle between his inclination to art and his love for his mother is depicted in a very moving and intimate way the novel is indeed the best study we have read of the war that occurs in many philistine families when one of the children shows a strong bent to art the characters of the mother son and father are not merely well drawn they have the breath of life in them and the sketches of the manufacturing and artistic sides of glasgow life are fresh and memorable  fiction justice of the peace by frederick niven eveleigh nash 6s mr niven has sufficient discernment to foresee what we have to tell him that he can do considerably better than in justice of the peace it is heralded by a letter to a friend not exactly a captatio benevolentiae contrived to disarm the critic but to set forth certain views which may help the reader to understand what follows they do help himup to a point they make him realise that mr niven like other authors is not altogether insensible to the difficulties of writing a good novel so far good and the tale glides along smoothly enough mr niven knows his glasgowits artlife and commercialism he has carefully portrayed the amiable and respectable merchant ebenezer moir his son martin who is enthusiastic for art and the woman of the family a coldblooded spouse and mother who is the evil angel of the group she is like de quinceys mother in her chill selfrighteousness but surpasses that dame in being full of religious and eugenistic fads as wellaltogether a ferociously unlovable personality who never says a kindly thing and never does a wise one for some dark reason she is always hostile to her sons artistic aspirations she is surpassingly disagreeable also towards her husband well there is the motifa perverse and domineering female and two meek gentlemanly males who always give way to her she wins all the tricks in the game she annoys father and son to such an extent that they finally die yes they allow themselves to be actually nagged into their graves like a couple of damned fools the subject is not exactly exhilarating and would be painful and even objectionable were the narrative not besprinkled with all kinds of other gossipsome good some hopelessly irrelevant there are pages ten at a time of superbly boyish chatter about nothing at allthe anglosaxon note of futility but the sinister impression remains has our author written such an ultrapathetic story to catch a certain class of readers who like their bowels of compassion moved by an emetic of this kind possibly but we are not moved we are simply annoyedannoyed with mr niven who as an intelligent and virile writer might have struck out into something more original after all the misunderstood son is rather vieux jeu and it is positively revolting to see these two great big grownup men the son and the father slowly sapped of their lifeblood by a frowsy female nonentity it upsets ones whole sense of terrestrial values why did mr niven not make them put their heads together like sensible fellows and devise a way of suppressing this motherthis family nuisance not necessarily vid the lethal chamber though that would have been the simplest solution to the problem butsayby packing her off to canada or keeping her gagged in some dark cellar for ten years or so that would have made a really  happy ending the son would have married the girl of his heart and grown into a second velasquezthe father free from his married nightmare might have entered upon a new flirtation with  jessie ray or some other pretty woman much better than allowing themselves to be killed in this preposterous fashion and then only think of the grand reconciliation when a letter arrives from canada imploring pardon and promising amendment whereupon the two magnanimous males decide to give the family nuisance one more chance by installing her as housekeeper or cook the

the merit of his work he has depicted sympathetically and we should say from a fund of direct knowledgethe friendly relationship between a glasgow merchant and a son who wishing to fall in with his parents desire that he should take up his businessfeels the call of art too insistently and succeeds ultimately in gaining not only his fathers consent but also his good will in his career the mulish obduracy of his other parent is exceedingly well conveyed though we may differ from mr niven in thinking that she had some justification for her dislike of certain phases in her sons life there are

city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has

B8088,"['8856873', '3146650']",  early italian lovestories translated by una taylor longmans  co one need not perhaps be especially straitlaced to feel some surprise at finding an english lady undertaking to introduce to english readers a selection from the italian nov elle  lovestories  she calls them and no doubt the poverty or politeness of language allows us but one term to denote say the sentiments of pal a mon and arcite on the one hand and those of nicholas and absolon on though other it is however with the latter species that the nov elle as a rule are concerned realism says bartoli  is the characteristic of the art of story tel ling  in italy and that there may be no doubt of his meaning he also explains how  the little stream of sensuality which trickles at the origins of our literature will go on receiving nourishment from new and abundant waters and will become a royal and majestic river well that is his way of putting it and if he means that the novella at first naive often coarse seldom to speak strictly licentious took on the last quality in the hands of boccacciowhose lightheartedness and bonhomie however blunt the edge of disapprobationand in the next two centuries acquired more and more of the spirit of the society it diverted till it culminated in the perversities brutalities and prolixities of such men as straparola giraldi and bandello few persons in this country will desire to contest his judgment also they will thankfully endorse miss taylors remark that english language and english feeling offer no equivalents for the diction and no counterpart for the sentiment of the lost centuries whatever that may mean of the italian renascence  novella  how true this is may be seen from the amazing transformation effected by shakespeare in the treatment of the stories which he borrowed from that source two of these the originals of  the merchant of venice and  much ado as told by giovanni fiorentino and bandello respectively appear in miss taylors collection and are indeed the two best things in it but little more than the bare story is to be found in thom and that ponderously and conventionally narrated there are no lorenzo and jessica no benedick and beatrice no dogberry least of all is there any  kill claudio the springs of laughter and tears are alike absent as a measure of bandellos taste and tact it may be mentioned that in his version of the story the person who corresponds to don john in the play the treacherous destroyer of an innocent girls reputation a cad who in any other country in europe would have been kicked out of docent society is married at the end to her sister of the other stories two are derived from boccaccio neither of them representative of him at his best one being extravagant and the other a trifle ghastly three are from masuccio a writer who has not even the tuscan elegance and who seems to have first set the fashion of the brutal and bloody tales which make up the great part of his successors repertory  two from giambattista giraldi commonly called cinthiomiss taylor by the way seems to think it was christian name giraldi surname cintioof which it can only be said that while not quite so repulsive as some of his they are as preposterous as any one is about a wife who dresses up in her husbands armour to fight an enemy of his whom he could quite well have polished off himself the other tells how another matron falls in love with a beautiful youth yet such is her virtue that though her adoring husband begs her in plain terms not to mind him she prefers pining to death consumed by a devouring passion  even retold  if we may borrow a phrase from the preface  the charm of this does not wholly evaporate though dozen is completed by a story from sebastiano erizzothe old tale of charlemagne the dead mistress and the ring diluted from petrarch and two from straparola an author in whom miss taylor must be unique in having found anything  exquisite the examples of him furnished here are fairly characteristic the first being in the original extremely coarse while such point as it has is as old as the story of sir tristram the other in which a girl swims at night across an arm of the sea to her paramour until her brothers find her out and by an artifice cause her to lose her way and get drowned is a good specimen of the monstrous embodiments of lust and cruelty which italy presented in the sixteenth century for it must be remembered that though the stories contained in this book are lumped together as early two centuries separated the telling of the first and the latest of them and ia those two centuries of the history of the peninsula was packed as much wickedness of every sort as all the other countries of europe put together could show and the literature faithfully reflects it there is no question here of conventions one has only to read the memoirs of decent french people of that age to see the reputation which italians bore even in that not particularly strict country to say that  for better or for worse our social decalogue  was not their law their evil was not our evil nor their good our good hardly improves matters the same might no doubt be said of the cities of the plain and therefore we say again one would not exactly have expected to lind a woman choosing for special study a field of literature of which the inexhaustible themes are the dishonour of her own sex and the brutality of the other so far as the translation goes there is not much fault to find the style is somewhat affected and precious but the sense ia usually given correctlywhere it is fit to be given tra i cittadini e quelli del contado  does not mean  between the citizens of that country and we wonder where miss taylor supposes  porto pireo  to be and why she makes it three hundred miles  from athens when the original says  venti stadi also we should like to know how you  strike sail for a port mr fords illustrations are graceful if not particularly original in character in the one to  the defeat of grazia the sex of the victorious combatant is plainly indicated in the way she handles her weapon  early italian love stories this is a handsome quarto printed in large life on very thick paper mr fords drawings are exactly suited to their purpose his composition is particularly rich and full without crowding as in the frontispiece and the salvestra his treatment of the nude as in his deathdream is less successful than his sumptuously costumed figures the pictures are frankly decorative and in the latterdaypreraphaelite manner though not scrupulously orthodox for i observe that his ladies have never more than one waist while burnejones model woman had usually three and if rossettis was content with only two she had always an additional stomach or pelican pouch in her throat nor are mr fords faces always lovely especially his lady of belmonte who looks every inch the vain cantankerous paragon whom shakespeare has unconsciously satirizedportia and mrs nickleby are the two most terrible and truculent though unconscious crucifixions which the virtuous female has ever suffered however pretty faces are not so valuable as general effect and mr ford does on the whole give a general impression of what we if not the italian novelists conceive the world of romance to have beena world of comely lovers who wore their best clothes all the week gallant travellers whose silk hose and ostrich plumes seem like the israelites garments never a bit the worse for rain or mud fair dames who elope down ladders in full court costume with train tiara and feathers and wearing all their jewellery on their persons instead of carrying it in a neat bag venerable buildings gorgeous furniture elysian gardens with wondrous rosetrees thickly studded with immense fat blooms all this is exactly as it should be the artist is not bound to remember that in those golden days the roses were really all single the palaces brand new that sleep was banished from the stately beds not so much by loves despair as by insect pests that lovers were sometimes plain and always imperfectly washed that the fine clothes were as faded as dingy as frowsy and much dirtier than those of a circus procession at the end of the travelling season mr ford is more conventionally romantic than the romances themselves and therefore his illustrations heighten instead of impair the illusion of the text the twelve novels are on the whole well selected and the translators introduction is marked by much good sense in it she disapproves of the archaic elizabethan style of her predecessors but hardly follows out her own principles her translations or rather versions are fairly done and the

work was too imaginative to be real and when she accepted with thanks some gum drops from mr barnes she did what any american girl would do with pleasure and what an english one would not understand gum drops  being an american phrase though not exclusively an american product in england they are called acidulated drops in this story however mr gunter deals with his own countrywomen and we shall assume that he does so with full knowledge of the subject we shall refrain from telling his story in detail as the knowledge of the incidents would lessen the attraction of the story as a whole lt is one of modern enchantment and it is alike realistic and improbable nevertheless there is much interest in it and the situations which might easily have been offensive are treated with tact and discretion we are in doubt however as to whether a hippopotamus was actually  tossing the water with his ugly snout where crocodiles abounded p 60 the language may sometimes puzzle those who are unread in american literature that a lady should  fire  her garters on the mantelpiece may not be understood by them to mean that she threw them there  to fix my bath is good american for getting a bath ready yet to write  jupe  for petticoat or underskirt is not when a person  jumps  another into a carriage it may not be understood that the meaning is to push the person in a rage of kisses may be more agreeable in fact than on paper the mans state of mind must be extremely bad when it is  rather doleful and disgruntled there are many references to  adorable ankles  but this may be local colouring the volume deserves to be read and it contains a phrase in which there is no admixture of fiction major horton promises to follow his daughter and her husband to europe  for be bas made a sale of most of his phosphate lands to one of those alldevouring english financial syndicates which seml a great deal of money io america and receive comparatively little back again there are seven tales in the collection entitled mrs knollys and other stories by f j stimson downey  co and they show skill without charm and ingenuity without success the best is also the longest and is a study of spanish life and character though in this the dialogue is not handled with good results the writer is cosmopolitan in the range of subject and very nearly at home with english phraseology it is only by accident that the autumn is described as the fall and that sufficient reason is found for describing the volume as american  while the first story which gives its name to the collection is free from the least hint of transatlantic penmanship if we except the use of the imaginary word substant as an adjective on the first page the narrative called  our consul at carlsruhe is the contribution which goes furthest towards justifying the ascription of american authorship all are clearly the work of the same hand but none in this volume suggests that the writer is seen at his best operatives and their strikes and struggles form the chief subject of octave thanets stories collected under the name of the heart of toil downey  co these stories are clearly the work of a practised hand and one acquainted with the best methods employed by the american writers of the short story the dialogue is clever and never used unnecessarily and the settings assigned to the dialogues are clear and simple all the tales are american and relate to nearly contemporary life in the states of illinois or iowa it is possible that english readers will find some difficulty with the dialect and phraseology which the writer seeks to express  but those who enjoy wellwritten stories will easily overcome the difficulty in question the pseudonym octave thanet is said to be that of miss alice french formerly of andover massachusetts and more recently of davenport iowa her writing is good and deserves to be better known in this country than it is the volume is most generously illustrated from drawings by a b frost some of which are successful  the greater inclination by edith wharton john lane 6s this book of short stories comes out of america and it is good it is very good mrs wharton is one of the few to grasp that obvious but muchneglected fact that the first business of a writer is to be able to write mrs wharton writes with the finished ease of the skilled craftsman and with the feeling and distinction of an artist her imaginative talent is therefore absolutely at her disposal a force which she can control perfectly and exploit to its fullest such a phenomenon is rare especially among women writers she is clearly of the school of mr henry james her subjects are chosen similarly to hisdramas of sentiment of the soul excursions into the obscure recesses of psychology but there are exceptions and it must be said that though she is subtle she is much less subtle than mr james and  may we utter it   possibly more articulate she at any rate has divined that the expressiveness of language has limits the story which pleased us best is the pelican being the history of a ladylecturer a widow who began to earn a living for the baby and couldnt give up posing pathetically as a stressful sacrificial mother even when the baby was a rich financier with a wife and family they began by being drawingroom lectures the first time i saw her she was standing by the piano against a flippant background of dresden china and photographs telling a roomful of women preoccupied with their spring bonnets all she thought she knew about greek art the ladies assembled to hear her had given me to understand that she was  doing it for the baby and this fact together with the shortness of her upper lip and the bewildering cooperation of her dimple disposed me to listen leniently to her dissertation happily at that time greek art wa still if i may use the phrase easily handled it wai as simple as walking down a museumgallery lined with pleasant familiar venuses and apollos all the later complicationsthe archaic and archaists conundrums the influences of assyria and asia minor the conflicting attributions and the wrangles of the erudite  still slumbered in the bosom of the future  pcientific critic greek art in those days began with phidias and ended with the apollo belvedere  and a child could travel from one to the other without danger of losing his way throughout this tale the phrasing is of the finest the analysis unerring the satire kindly keen and the form without flaw what mrs wharton lacks and we feel the shortcoming to be grave is a sense of the dramatic her themes are dramatic enough but the drama seems to be decentralised frittered away instead of being gathered up as surely the short story demands into a single resounding stroke this is so with  the pelican where the scene in which the  baby makes his mother confess her duplicities distinctly does not show that effectiveness whioh is latent within it a journey again suffers in the same way the plight of the woman travelling with the husband whose death she must at all costs keep secret from the other occupants of the pullman is tremendous but there is no clou no adequate culmination on the other hand  souls belated  has a climax which is at once legitimate and striking the greater inclination may impress itself on neither the english nor the american public but it is none the less distinguished and delightful and if mrs wharton continues to write up to the level of it she cannot fail ultimately to make her mark,storie

brothers children it was his dying wish that i should appeal to you in their inhalf   i dont know how it is muttered ralph walking up and down thc room  but whenever a man dies without any property of

softened either by bis nieces beauty or her distress stretch a point and say the latter  you must try it and if the life is too hard perhaps drcs3making or tambourwork will come lighter have you ever done anything sir turning to his nephew   no replied nicholas bluntly   yn i thought not 1 said ralph this is the way my brother brought up his children maam  nicholas bas not long completed such educacation as his poor father could give him rejoined mrs nickleby and he was thinking of  of making something of him some day said ralph the old story always thinking and never doing if my brother had been a niau of activity and prudence he might have left you a rich woman maam  and if he had turned bis son into the world us my father turned mc when i wasnt as old as that boy by a year and a half he would have been in a situation to help you instead of being a burden upon you and increasing your distress my brother was a thoughtless inconsiderate man mrs nickleby and nobody i am sure eau have better reason to feel that than you   are you willing to work sir he inquired frowning on his nephew   otcourse i am replied nicholas haughtily then see here sir said his uncle this caught my eye this morning and you may thank your stars for it  with this exordium mr ralph nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket and after unfolding it and looking for a short time among the advertisements read as follows   ian ivrionat mr wackford squcerss academy dotheboys ibill itt the delightful village of dotheboys near ireta bridge in yorkshire youth are boarded clothed booked furnished with

faltered kate the scene nt thc saracens head on snow hill is in the best pickwick manner here is the schoolmaster from the picturesque neighbourhood of greta uridge   mr squcerss appearance was not prepossessing he hid but one eye and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two the eye he bad was unquestionably useful but decidedly not ornamental being of a greenish grey and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door the blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up which gave him a very sinister appearance especially when he smiled at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations his hair was very flat and shiny save at the ends where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner he was about two or three iind titty and a trifle below the middle size he wore a white neckerchief with long eadsandasiiit of scholastic black but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long and his trousers a great deal too short he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable  mr squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffeeroom fireplaces titted with one such table as is usually seen in iotfeerooms and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition in a corner of the seat was a very small deal trunk tied round with a scanty piece of cord and on the trunk was perchedbis laceup halfboots and corduroy trousers dangling in the airi diminutive boy with his shoulders drawn up to his ears and his hands planted on his knees who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster from time to time with evident dread and apprehension  halt past threemuttered mr siiieersturnb from the

nothing sir exclaimed mr saucers   please sir i sneezed rejoined the boy tren hiing till the little trunk shook under him oh sneezed did you  retorted mr squeers then what did you say nothing for sir  in default of a better answer to this juevaon the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry wherefore mr spicers knocked bini off the trunk with a blow on oin sule of his face and knocked him on again with u mow on the other wait till i get you down into yorkshire my young gentleman said mr saucers and then iii give you the rest will you hold that noise sir

life and adventures of nicholas nickltby bv charles dickens chapman and hall great success is a thing as little understood in literature nowadiys as great failure the tut issi mus ibis is found in the old place the sale of the pickwick papers was very generally held to be in the nature of a bookselling curiosity and when a j career as prosperous was foretold for a new work of the same extent by the same hand wise people j shook their heads and said it was impossible it has been proved possible notwithstanding the sale of nicholas nickleby is understood even thus early to have exceeded by many thousands that of l pickwick papers without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent it establishes though claim of thc work to critical consideration on the highest grounds and with reference to the best models we propose in this spirit briefly to examine its pretensions to rank with thc enduring fictions of our language since richardson published in successive portions his famous story of clarissa har lo we ami enthusiastic damsels eager for the conversion of lovelace besieged and implored the author as for a living sinner whose future state depended on thc decision to  save his soul alive no characters of an unfinished1 work of fiction have excited anything like the interest manifested by large classes of persons in all ranks for the fate of the various actors in the tale of nicholas nicklcby the cibbers of that day after  a delicious meal of miss byron  in one volume were not more anxious for  another slice of herein the next than the cibbers of our own after regaling themselves with a squeers or a smike or a newman noggs or a vincent crummies in number six have been for other slices of them in number seven this shows us at the outset a great secret of the popularity of the author he seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality isle thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand our sympathies are never left to wander off into quarters vague or undefined from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them and this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or i w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so in everything of that kind that he presents to us there is in his manner of doing it the manliness and simplicity of nature or the truth of life as it is we are never repelled by the abominations of egotism conceit or dogmatism we are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule if there is good going on there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty  and if there is evil it runs no chance of being mistaken for good the quantity of invention observation and knowledge of character observable in tl writings of mr dickens is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion now by all the various readers of this tale of nicholas nichlebyand they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each otherthese various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt in this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces  them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them this is a test which only a man of genius could bear it is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low in regard to the customs and usages of life are so revealed for it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity than by the alliances of common habits that we are all linked together the highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other peoples opinions these are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in incidentally they embrace many others his style is for the most part admirable bating some faults of occasional exaggeration which we may presently advert to it is fresh and racy and has the surpassing charms of simplicity earnestness animal spirit and good humour a rare virtue in it is that it is always whether grave or gay thoroughly intelligible and for the most part thoroughly natural its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos it is a quick as warm as comprehensive as the sympathies it is taxed to express we know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet or iltostfate mot happily

old facts with a new life it breathes into old thoughts a new emotion who that hus read his descriptions ofthe various localities of loudon as set down in this story of nicholas nickuby can ever expect to forget them more a fresh glow of warmth and light plays over thc cheerful and familia places a deeper mist of misery and blackness settles on thc darker scenes with him we pass along misty streets in some cold and ogy morning while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour yet were it oay for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears distantly and indistinctly as though the o had muflicd them we could not doubt that it was london we enter with him by night through long double rows of brightly burning lamps a noisy bust lim crowded scene in which he shows us the rags of the squalid balladsinger fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmiths glittering treasures and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men add this is the same london as before at all times and under every aspect bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms we come to know better the very places we have known best wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in golden square thc saracens head on snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality the alphonse of cadogan place reveal themselves plain bills to our practised eye  and the sight of even a real butterfly fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless city square startles us no more and with all these masterly requisites for his art is mr dickens a perfect novelist by no means he has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story without which that rank can never be attained he has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration to which though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the pickwick papers he is still too prone in saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him it is a due compliment to such a writer to assume that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together the great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot we need hardly observe is fielding for exquisitest contrivance for happiest extrication of story he stands quite unrivalled in this respect tom jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last which docs not more or less tell upon the story while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc gents by which its results ure to be worked out thus black george is scarcely a less essential personage than tom jones himself and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine each in his own peculiar sphere to one grand effect its only episode the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on is that of thc old man of thc hill introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of cervantes and le sage passing this there is not an eddy a current scarcely a single ripple on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art nicholas nie kleby could not stand such a test for an instant a want of plan is apparent in it from the first an absence of design the plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers instead of having been mapped out beforehand the attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recall us to the main interest and action admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect art the consequence of it is in this case that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on though writer and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters needful

our seldomvarying strong affection for him to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit we can scarcely reproach ourselves for this we are not sure that even mr dickens himself is indisposed to quiz

B5892,"['2491258', '3239214']",  short stories dunky fitlow by a e coppard cape 7s 6d among contemporary writers of the short story there are few whose work has been so consistently exciting and disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it

writers who realising that the short story is the twentieth centurys most individual contribution to literature have schooled their genius to this highly disciplinary form the modern short storyas witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with fiery sharpness in fifty pages the author can give a degree of reality to the lives of his characters which many novelists never achieve in four hundred but the best story in the book is  the small lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed to stand alone   sally go round the moon  is a long short story by a young writer whose work has for some time been attracting the discriminating few mr batess special forte is stories in a delicately lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the exercise of just that lyric power which is his special contribution to the art of the modern short story,storie

B1152,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it

contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin

tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,storie

wellnigh miraculous escape from the death to which the english villain drove her is one of those surprises that leave a reader comfortable and satisfied after he has had his fill of melodrama  fiction the mechanics of heroism black heart and white heart and other stories by h bider haggard longmans 6s daniel herrick by sidney herbert burchell gay  bird 6s paul the optimist by w p dothie john long 6s the real converse of egoism is not as some think altruism but heroworship it is in fact a great relief from the tormenting envies of life to gaze on some manifest and overtopping figure of success standing clearly out amid the striving herd even embittered rivals may be at peace while admiring the same superior being uplifted convincingly above them both by his own stature and not by any mere pedestal envy comes in when by standing on tiptoe a man gets level with his superior not when his superior tops him by more than a head healthy heroworship not only is the converse of envy but it yields delightful anodyne for envys pangs something of ourselves must needs reside in what we worship our hero is ever as far as we are concerned a projection of our own consciousness into a kind of heaven whatever our hero may be in himself so in fiction it is because we feel with the hero that we enjoy him and how do we know the hero  easily enough the hero wins his way through and because of everything to triumphant selfexpression he bursts into flower if he renounce behold his head garnished with a halo if he die behold him a trailing cloud of glory if he be happy behold him splendidly happy yoked to earths loveliest the career of a hero feeds the eye of the heroworshipper the concept of success is greater in his mind by the sight and he is happy by sympathy and the spell of a dream but the hero must be human his heroism must be illustrated in such fashion that he never passes wholly into the misty region of the demigod when for instance we read in the cuchullin saga that cuchulainn dealt three blows in the liss so that eight men fell from each blow and one escaped in each group of nine we simply shrug our shoulders wearily the feat transcends possibility but not in that alone is the boast of it nothing we lack circumstance it is not  reported when however guy livingstone in dying crushes the silver cup in his hand we feel both man and matter the grip is on the mind as well as on the cup mr bider haggard has never neglected this golden rule of herocreationvisualise his grandiose situations are always clearly conceived and are appreciated accordingly he has given us many guy livingstones in savage setting and he loves to exhibit them in berserk mood it is a black guy livingstoneone of cetywayos zulus whom he gives us in black heart and white heart  with a roar like a lions he seized a man  round the waist and thigh and  hurled him over the edge of the cliff to find his death on the rocks of the pool of doom we watch him racing on foot after his gallopping enemy  white heart a scoundrel of herculean strength till finally they wrestle for life and death but mr haggard is weary of muscular strength and though there is prodigious exercise of this gift in the three stories contained in his latest volume it is not primary and ultimate it falls short of the heroic courage of soul as against physical prowess is the theme that is uppermost in two of these stories this is an advance for there is a taint of the shambles in all berserk rages but it is an advance that means no decline in a certain gruesome picturesqueness an attempt in language at times curiously modern to recreate a city of monomotapa gives us a hebrew martyr and divine justice does not allow a lover to be happy who has bowed to baal for the sake of saving the life of bis sweetheart but heroism is allowed the last word it is not mr haggards way to leave arch enemies in ascendance irony is alien to the heroic spirit  an eye for an eye is a motto dear to those who perceive the hurt of heroes mr haggards martyr finds time to utter the scathing contents of a page before he is murdered and an arrow shot from the base of a cliff by an outraged hero finds a vital spot in a ruffianly king standing on the summit the missionary hero is an individual whom mr haggard treats in decidedly striking fashion what if a believer were required to demonstrate the literal truth of his message at the peril of his life  that is the question the novelist set himself and in sending the bev thomas owen among the sons of fire he allows great faith the privilege of proving its validity semimiracles happen and the missionary converts the wizard who poisons him the wizard becomes a martyr and in the attitude of crucifixion is seen animating the troops of his king he dies potent brilliant prophetic ah mr haggard what an incorrigible heromonger you are a hero of a kind that requires more managing than the haggardian type is that of the modern pseudohistorical novel mr burchell has made some reputation as a depictor in romance of the stuart period the essay in art of such a novel as daniel herrick which takes up the period of charles il and sketches his wronged portuguese queen in some detail was clearly more difficult to executeall things considered more ambitious toothan the tasks lately performed by mr haggard admit that mr burchell shows greater deftness than mr haggard and puts into his puppets more of the stuff of men and women as this poor world produces them still one must consider mr burchell the inferior romancer of the two why  because mr burch ells hero eavesdrops too luckily because coincidence is too obsequious to him in real life coincidence is so rare that its occurrence frequently betrays our superstition or our desire not to be thought superstitious in fiction it is a monstrosity daniel herrick tells his own tale he is the offspring of unknown parents and one congratulates mr burchell for a courageous realism in allowing one of them to have been a rascal he spends laborious days in serving bis queen privily and in endeavouring to unravel a case of abduction wherefore he is persistently haunted by a hag heroically aided by a comely dame who loves him but to whom he can only be brotherly and sentenced to death by a treasonable assembly a hag mark you affords an excellent foil to a hero she makes the reader twice as uneasy as an ordinary villain mr burchell be it added invokes the plague to serve the hero in an extremity paints a touching portrait of poor queen catherine and a sprightly one of  016 bowley remains a hero of a third sortwooden yet throbbing with a certain genuineness of intentionthe idealistic intention of his creator paul the optimist is a man who is not to be knocked down or discoloured by buffets of mortal chance he is truthful he has a sort of clairvoyance yet he falls into a murdertrap and is nearly killed as tailors assistant pawnbrokers clerk clerk in some gasworks he stands for plain realism if you disentangle him from the terrible thicket of plot into which mr dothie with shortsighted ingenuity has led him where would you be without the old bethlehem miracle is the last

sensations it is a pity that a writers good things are often only his sideshows to sum up we have taken a few heroes from contemporary fiction and find them not unheroic but on the whole too showy too well abetted by circumstance too little realised from within we do not want imitations  but would it not be a good thing if some of our heromakers would ponder the character of a certain beauchamp of story who died in saving a guttersnipe  for there in all fullness is the futility and fineness of the herothere is the churning process exhibited  there is the waste and anguish felt and at last after countless irritations the beauty seen after him fiction seems to deal in toy heroes,storie

the volume after the fashion of mr dickenss christmas numbers in the present instance we are introduced to the state of things at one time existing in  the united parishes of st barabbas and ananias the less which parishes though united in name were very disunited in spirit being in fact at constant feud how the new curate by his mild and benignant spirit effected a thorough reconciliation and a genuine union and how the rate and taxcollectors had weekly meetings at the  greyhound and told stories based on their personal experiences we must leave the reader to find out for himself we shall only inform him that the stories so told are five in number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds seven flights is a collection of fairy tales and supernatural narratives clustered about one parent fiction with which all are slowly connected the sedan chair in question is a magic structure endured

westminster the first possessor is sir wilfred neville a harumscarum fellow of queen elizabeths reign who uses it for visiting various parts of the world where he meets with a variety of strange adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number

the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course

christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the

piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle

giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on

dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that

volume mr sharp has told us all that we need to know of the short and terribly sad life of his friend its author philip bourke marston was born in 1850 the only son of dr westland marston the dramatist at the age of four his eyes began to sufferas it was believed from the effects of belladonna which had been administered medicinally  and the mischief was further increased by a blow accidentally received at play soon symptoms of cataract manifested themselves and in spite of the best surgical treatment blindness crept slowly but steadily upon the boy the hours of his loneliness were solaced by literary pursuits  and before he was twenty marston had produced much excellent and individual work in poetry aided by his devoted mother and his younger sister each of whom acted as his ready aud willing amanuensis he was fortunate too in his intercourse with the talented circle who frequented his fathers house and he seems to have drawn to himself with quite a peculiar closeness the friendship of many of the most gifted younger writers of the time bu fate had other terrible blows in sfore with which to smite the blind poet the company of those who brought a measure of sunlight into his darkened days was thinned by death with startling swiftness first came the death of his mother then the death by consumption of his betrothed then the death of his sister cicely  more than any sister ever was to any brother   and oliver madox brown arthur oshaughnessy and his wife marstons elder sister rossetti and james thomson of the city of dreadful night all followed on the dark way till he came to believe that his friendship was a deadly thing  every friend he bitterly wrote  every friend whom i love seems to be brought within the influence of my unhappy fate and day by day his own strength began to decline till at length early in the present ye ir he was seized by paralysis and passed away into the rest for which in his weariness he had often longed after reading the pathetic record of their authors life we turn with interest t his collected stories which form the bulk of the volume talescomposed at his typewriter during his saddened later years aud for the most part published in american periodicals of which many will bo new to english readers the story from which the volume is titi ed one of the longest and best in the book tells how herbert montague a london plinter in a mood of irresistible piry gave shelter to au italian orphan girl whom hn hid found singing in the streets on a wild february night tended her with ptrental care and finally wedded her keeping his marriage secret however lest his wealthy father who had been sufficiently scandalised by his sons bohemian ways should be hopelessly alienated for three years all goes well but at length montague meets in society mrs heather a fascinating widow a woman of wide culture and superb beauty in whom he finds a fuller appreciation of his art and his aims in life than was possible to the poor little mabel at home gradually the wife feels that his love has taken wing and fled montague struggles hard against his infatuation finally discloses to mrs heather the fact of his marriagean announcement which is received by the lady with contemptuous scorn and astonishment and then returns home to find that his wife has put an end to her life by poison leaving a letter declaring that she has done so to free him from the irksome yoke of her presence and her wifely claims the next story the lady of the graves is a weird piece in the manner of poe and in  trapped we have observant characterpainting in the portrait of albert daurelles the cruel and sensual french poet whom the english heroine of the tale marries and endows with her fortune lu  the actress and her drama the husband of mrs brakehill a popular tragedienne is with her connivance murdered by her lover and featherstone a young dramatist is drugged and placed in circumstances which lead to his arrest as the assassin driven to frenzy which ends in actual madness by the infidelity of her lover the actress denounces him from the stage as the murderer featherstone in the end is acquitted and marries the bride who has believed iu him and been faithful to him in his time of trial  her price  is another wild tale of love and crime and among the slighter pieces of the book are sir charles godfrey baronet  miss stotfords speciality and  a letter to eva the last a particularly delicate and beautiful study of unwearied and selfforgetful affection it cannot be said that these stories contain their

stories are thoroughly readable well worthy of republication sufficiently good to make us regret that their writer was never able to undertake some such more sustained and lengthened effort in the direction of fiction as was often in his thoughts these brief tales are skilfully composed and the readers interest is well sustained they deal with the intense and passionate things of life with though overmastering power of love with the pathos and tragedy of death they abound in telling and vivid situations and if they frequently verge on the sensational the improbable and even the

B4515,"['6731552', '3162037']",  the jungle book ti by rudyard kipling misc millans hitherto we have been accustomed to find inequality in mr kiplings work he has never yet given us a book entirely good each collection of his stories is a mixture of suooess and failure naturally this peculiarity has always stirred some annoyance and perplexity in his critics for at his best he is not easily surpassed while at his worst he is almost puerile there is a popular superstition not without an element of truth in it that equality and mediocrity are interchangeable terms but though no author however gifted can always be at his best the inequalities of mr kiplings work offer too startling a contrast his frequent falls from the heights to the deeps his dazzling leaps from the mire to tne mountain top cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any theory however respectable so we are unable to take up a new volume of his without knowing our hopes are dogged by a most uncomfortable fear faith in his ultimate suooess is founded tpon the fact that the more di cult his task seems though greater though certainty that he will be successful consequently if he wishes to sustain his reputation he must refuse resolutely to write on subjects commonplace or indifferent the jungle book has been cordially welcomed and it is only just to confess at once that it is more carefully designed than anything he has yet given to us there are no serious blemishes in the style and grammar as a pieoe of technique it is quite blameless but a serious doubt arises as to whether the matter of the book is at all worthy of the labour bestowed on it again it is certain that thoso flashes of genius that used to dazlo us seldom illumine its pages in them mr kiplings finest qualities are to seek we prefer to hear his men and women talk as only mulvaney or mrs hawkesby can talk be bagheora and baloo never so ingenious it is impossible to rid oneself of the conviction that any author rather more clever than the average could have contrived though greater part of th jungle book there are indeed a few pages that no one but the creator of soldiers three could have written and one new friendship is cemented for whioh we are grateful rikki tikki though only a mongoose fights his way stuantly enough into the list of mr iplings immortals the history of his war with the cobras is entirely delightful and refuses to be forgotten there are times when plain speaking is necessary and then the most ardent admirer of an author must if he be honest say the truth though truth is that the jungle book had it been written by a person unknown might have stirred a languid interest and a cor ta in reasonable hope of better things to come as the work of a man of recognised genius it compels disappointment it is generally true that to gain a worthy success a writer must toil hard must choose his words with discrimination but there is no rule without an exception and in this case mr kipling would seem to be that exception his best work achieves itself apparently spontaneously it is a startling nay dangerous thing to say of a man that he places failure far from him only when he is most careless but mr kipling may at any rate be advisedadapting a remark of mr henleys not to concern himself again with words and phrases but with the greater truths of destiny and emotion his last bcok prompts this reflection few authors know the human heart so well as he let him forsake thereforo mowglis and mules and monkeys and remember that his vital phrases have ever been born not made percy addleshaw  the jungle book  the jungle book is made up of story and song both of them rich in vitality and imagination but every time a verse occurs as the heading of a chapter one is inclined to think that mr kipling should write nothing else so instinctive is his power over vigorous rhythm and so vivid are his ballad pictures this  nightsong in the jungle  is only meant to tune

not be  not for nothing are ye called the free people ye fought for freedom and it is yours eat it o wolves there is something sternly grand about all the mowgli stories imaginative children whether or not they follow the narrative with perfect comprehension will be impressed and even awestruck by the solemnity and dignity of jungle life as mr kipling paints it of the habits of the animals of the scenes amidst which they live he has a marvellous knowledge it is this picturesqe knowledge joined to a vigorous interpretation of not their own character but the ideal nature he has constructed for them a nature at once remote and familiar to us that makes the success and the fascination of the stories man without his intellectual power but with his natural faculties of sight and hearing infinitely intensified and without the enfeeblement the deceit the pettiness that are the fruits of his civilisation would be something like this conception of the beast that obeys the jungle law we are grotesquely reminded here and there of the ideals of rousseau and the natural state idealists their primitive man they would have desired to be like mr kiplings loyal beasts there are stories in the book where he is not at his highest point of vigour  the white seal  comes near to being a failure and so does  servants of the queen the adventures of rikkitikkitavi the mongoose that fought with nag the cobra and nagaina his wife are too deadly to be amusing and the glamour of imagination does not play round them to turn the terror into fascination the temperature of ones admiration having been reduced by these we find several other things to wonder at not all admiringly mr kipling cannot resist opportunities of political allusion indeed invents them and his love for playing the schoolmaster grows on him it is this quality that is at the bottom of the imperfect sympathy which runs parallel in many readers minds with a warm admiration for him the pedagogue in him hides under free and vigorous and unconventional speech but he is mostly there were he to fall asleep a bit oftener and let some careless lawless fellow take his place if even only for a few minutes mr kiplings range of understanding of human nature would be greatly widened but grumbling at mr kiplings temperament is not very relevant here it does not greatly offend in  the jungle book more to the purpose is it to point to the feats of imagination in these beast stories next to the three mowgli tales for great qualities comes  toomai of the elephants toomai is a little boy who saw what few be lieved in and none had seen the great  dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the garo hills he was on the back of the tame elephant kala nag that he tended and when kala nag got the signal for the dance the boy was born away up the wooded hill through the thick underwood through the bed of a river to a space of three or four acres where the grass was trampled and hard the assembling elephants crashed through the trees and entered the danceplace and rolled their eyes and tossed their trunks and clicked their tusks and flicked their great tails  then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs and a dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little toornai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the ground onetwo onetwo as steadily as tripbammers the elephants were stamping altogether now and it sounded like a wardrum beaten at the mouth of a cave the dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall and the booming went on and the ground rocked and

broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills and the booming stopped with the first ray as though the light had been an order it is a magnificent sight that toomai saw that night when the

B6595,['8987816'],  a collection of short stories the garnet bracelet by alexander kuprin duckworth 7s net in his introduction to this volume of short stories mr lion phelps professor of english literature at yale university has seized the opportunity to inform caution and put right american opinion upon the whole subject of russian literature his manner in so doing is unfamiliar to english readers it makes us feel that while we read we are like alice dwindling away in height by the end of the first page we are much too young even to attend a university  by the end of the second and especially when that tiny little joke is popped into our baby mouths we are of a size to spell out maxims at a learned knee  a novel is not great simply because it is written in the russian language nor because its author has a name difficult to pronounce or a slavishno pun intendedadoration of russian novels is not tself an indication of critical intelligence or a pessimist is not necessarily a profound thinker nor is unclean ness in itself a sign of virility but surely mr phelps exaggerates the extreme innocence of american literary opinion  he must surely be mistaken in not realising that it has long cut down these modest flowers of thought with its little hatchet nevertheless even kuprin is described in terms that remind us of those infantile dogmatics about the cat and the mat and  run fox run    he soars and he sinks  he is holy and he is coarse  he is sublime and he is flat between this introduction and the preface contributed by the translator mr pasvolsky who ls at naive pains to inform us when kuprin is at his best and why he is at his best the author makes a difficult bow but happily the first story which gives the title to the book is wonderfully successful and so the bow is a triumphant one  the garnet bracelet  is a story of hopeless love it tells how a poor official fell in love with the beautiful princess vera nicolaeyna for seven years he wrote to her and then on her birthday he sent her the bracelet at this her husband and brother interfered they sought the man out and he after giving them to understand that he fully realised the impossibility of the situation promised them to disappear next day the princess read of his suicide she received from him a letter written just before he had shot himself expressing his happiness in having loved her and begging her to ask someone to play for her in his memory the largo appassionata from sonata 2 op 2 of beethoven from this oldfashioned plot oldfashioned like the poor bracelet with its illpolished stones its green stdrie in the middle with the five deep red ones surrounding there come rays of deep quivering light and all that they reveal is linked together just for one moment becomes part of the tragic lifestory of the strangely simple man for whom  to love was enough  may nothing transient or vain trouble your beautiful soul he writes but the life of the princess is composed of what is transient and vain  the society in which she lives is transient and vain  real love could have no part in it but being woman her secret dream is of a love that shall fill her whole life  it has come near her and now it is gone for ever the other stories in the book do not approach the first  horse thieves  and  the jewess  are we imagine written under the influence of tchehov the first which is an account of a little boys association with beggars and thieves and contains a hideous picture of mob violence has many a touch which puts us in mind of the great writer but only to marvel before kuprins heaviness at the delicacy and surety of the other in  the jewess again it is easy to see in what soil the idea has been nourished but a sorry weed has grown coarse straggling with no flower at all for all the authors urging until at the last he has propped it up with an old stick of allegory which never for an instant deceives us a word must be said about  an evening guest in a letter giving a hst of the works he considers his most successful the author places it first this is very interesting as showing the extraordinary difference between the russian consciousness and ours to us  the evening guest  is quite impossible  it is very nearly absurd in its ingenuousness one evening somebody knocks at th writers door it sets him wondering who is there who might be there and how unknown is the future he compares life at great length to a game of cards and then imagines that some madman should hit upon the idea of a lottery of life on an appointed day there would stand an enormous urn filled with cards one of which we must draw and then what is life except this drawing of lots out of an urn of fate  and so on until he falls to wondering whether he will be able to make certain sounds to which that other person on the other side of the door will respond until finally when we are almost inclined to call it childish he cries  every time that i think of the vastness

allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is

his preface to take leave of the profession of letters will yet pass away and that this is not the last or nearly the last book in which he will entice readers to the increase of their property as men

mind in a large volume of selections from all books between the book of job and the family herald plato and mr solomon tupper meet together in its pages the many thoughts on many things 19 are evidently the produce of years of research the author rides a hobby for the public benefit though very many of the thoughts want the pith that mr southgate has supposed to be contained in them yet a far larger number of them consists of good things well said to find them the collector has ransacked rubbish among which nobody else would have though of hunting for a discovery of treasure and he has found morsels of treasure often in books that were thrown aside as empty centuries ago and seldom have been opened since they were dismissed from notice the complete absence of literary bias is an admirable qualification for a gatherer if there be sometimes a confusion between diamonds and broken glass that matters not very much who would refuse a bag of jewels because bristol stones and spangles form a fourth part of its bulk the  many thoughts are here arranged in the form of an analytical dictionary we look up in this dictionary any subject under the sun and are pretty sure to find

new american book describing cheerfully and cleverly holidays spent in enjoyment of wild sports in the country between the st lawrence and lake champlain wild northern scenes by s h hammond 25 though it degenerates often into what is commonly called rigmarole there is reality and freshness in it if not read too critically the scenes will be liked religious books are not to be excluded from the gift books of the christmas season we may mention therefore a new edition of the scripture characters 26 of dr candlish whose fame is deservedly great among scotch divines and a new series of mr arnots illustrations of the book of proverbs 27 which are brief numerous and very practical to these volumes by scotch divines we add a little christmas book contributed by members of a very different communion unitarian writers some of them high in literary credit have produced a various and very interesting collection of original papers which appear in an inexpensive volume edited by dr beard under the name of sabbath leisure 28 as we have passed from the scotch church to the unitarian church we may go on to speak of mr william smiths thormdale or the conflict qf opinions 29 the book is not theological or controversial but it builds on the foundation of a little story a pleasant edifice of conflicting speculation upon social problems and the inner life of man the book is the work of a sound thinker who is well read in philosophy and has a cultivated taste he knows how to start game in plenty for those who enjoy the kind of sport to which he tempts his reader one would not wish to hunt in safer company over the wide province in which be is at home there is no risk with him of being lost among the wilds of an unholy scepticism there is a class of speculative readers who would rather ride their fancy than their reason to the hunting field be it known to them that the edglish opium eater has now a literary disciple in the form of an american hasheesh eater 30 who protest that he is a real dreamer upon cannabis indica not merely an imaginer of dreams his book is wild of course and some of it is clever the exiles of italy 81 a story in one volume is a faithful transcript of the disappointments and the sufferings of the italian patriot the book is vigorously written as a novel it is interesting as a faithful picture of the italian exiles past experience and

with its subject my feathered friends 40 by the rev j g wood is a very interesting childs book upon birds of many kinds two or three small books of pure fancy must be included in our sketch of christmas literature one is the wayside fancies 47 of mrs broderip daughter of thomas hood this little volume published in the summer well deserves to be remembered in the winter and to pass from hand to hand among the gift books of the present season the delicacies of the fathers character are transmitted more surely through the daughter than his humour was transmitted through the son mrs broderip tells how she and her brother played at authorship as children and now they have both written books each book is good but in these  wayside fancies we find evidences of the finer taste and surer traces of a latent strength the book is one in which a genial reader will take pleasure and it is the only original miscellany in prose and verse worth mentioning among the new books ready against christmas of a stock less poetical has come a writer of good versemiss mary humewho furnishes for christmas yormiton 48 a story none the less acceptable for being presented to us as a dramatic tale in smooth blank verse with every thought in it carefully weighed and polished we have more than once protested against the foppery of scorning thoughts better than one usually is content to read in prose because the verse in which they are communicated is not of the highest quality there is a metrical literature in this day fed by the best energies and aspirations of highminded men and women not a few of whom would have obtained honour as poets in an age of feebler or less universal effort we believe that the public denies pleasure to itself and fairly earned esteem where it is due when it neglects wholly this good metrical literature which has grown up on the middle ground between our poetry and prose there ought to be a public ready for any clever and truehearted book like miss humes normiton or mr lockyers earl godwins feast 49 or mr lockers london lyrics 50 we commend these three metrical books to the notice of all christmas readers in  london lyrics there is the liveliness of much gay

pantomimes for months before the close of the year dozens of busy pens are at work setting down the fancies of dozens of busy brains and with december there comes a rash of storybooks a heap of these ephemeral fictions lies before us and we proceed to give some account of each individual in the lot encouraged by the success of their  bunch of keys published this time last year messrs thomas hood t w robertson w j prowse w s gilbert c w scott and thomas archer have clubbed together to produce under the editorship of the firstnamed gentleman another similar collection of tales to which they have ven the title of  rates and taxes the various narratives are held together by a little story the separate portions of which cornmence and finish the volume after the fashion of mr dickenss christmas numbers in the present instance we are introduced to the state of things at one time existing in  the united parishes of st barabbas and ananias the less which parishes though united in name were very disunited in spirit being in fact at constant feud how the new curate by his mild and benignant spirit effected a thorough reconciliation and a genuine union and how the rate and taxcollectors had weekly meetings at the  greyhound and told stories based on their personal experiences we must leave the reader to find out for himself we shall only inform him that the stories so told are five in number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds seven flights is a collection of fairy tales and supernatural narratives clustered about one parent fiction with which all are slowly connected the sedan chair in question is a magic structure endured with powers simila to those of the wonderful carpet 1 in the arabian tale or the wishing caps in northern legends that is to say the owner has only to seat himself in it and to desire to be in a certain place and he is there in a moment when he wishes to return the sedan having disappeared immediately on  setting down he is to exclaim sedan appear and there it stands ready to do its masters bidding it has been constructed by a moorish astrologer and is the property of the successive heads of the old english family of the nevilles by whom it is preserved in a strange dunsky mansion at westminster the first possessor is sir wilfred neville a harumscarum fellow of queen elizabeths reign who uses it for visiting various parts of the world where he meets with a variety of strange adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number by mr tenniela most charming contrast in their grace delicacy finish  and airy fancy to the ugly phantasmagoria in which so many of the artists of the present day indulge balderscourt follows the fashion common with christmas books and is a concretion of small stories embedded in one large mass a christmas party is assembled at an old eliabethan mansion on the welsh borders and as the younger ones want something to excite them in the long evenings the elders relate or read diverse tales some of these have relation to matters of fact others are purely imaginary a few fairy tales being among the number the book is well written and fall of amusing matter while some very fair illustrations add to the attractiveness of the whole miss bowmans  boy pilgrims  is a book of which the object is the conveying of information on geography and history though it takes the form of a story two boys set out under the guardianship of a friend to visit the chief countries and cities of the east and thus we are introduced to acounts of 4gy syria palestine and other bible lands plenty of adventure seasons the less exciting parts of the narrative and for boys who like this mode of getting at facts the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course we have nothing more to say mr rennes  featherland or how the birds lived at greelawn is a tale which will probably amuse children being all about birds and beasts who are made to talk in the manner of human beings the last book on our list fairy lend or recreation for the rising generation by the late thomas and jane hood their son and daughter is a second edition and therefore known to the public it is a charming collection of fairy t  in which humour is quaintly blended with fancy  christmas stories mrs lirrpers legacy chapman and hall a  bunch of keys groombridge tenants at will chambers ye christmas number of london society beetons christmas annual beeton comic newes christmas box it is difficult to say why the public taste should be supposed to evince a disposition about christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the garrulous old lodging housekeeper bear mar s of the hand which gave us mrs gamp and mr micawber we may particularise the scene between majorjackman and the taxgatherer i i i i i i i i ii which as a piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle brings back reminiscences of the fanoru ghostly mailcoach which carried though deadletters in pickwick the story of the poor relation is readable and suitable and that of the schoolboy though much too prolix is in its wild but somewhat picturesquo improbability by far the most seasonaake of the collection a bunch of keys the next work on our list aspires more we apprehend to the nature of a giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on the part of halfadozen young writers that the good ol0 custom of christmas annuals should not die out altogether the editor is mr thomas hood the framework is contributed by mr t w robertson and the stories are written by messrs t archer w s gilbert t hood iv j prowse and clement scott mr robertson has bestowed more pains than are usual upo01 his part of the task andl has given uis a very pleasant sketch of two young brothers who finding somne theatrical dresses elope with theni and wander alout the country as savage boy aild his keeper ultiniately they break down are taken in by a kindheinrted lighthousekeeper who gets theni to fish with a net the result of which is that they catch a  bunch of keys and the more intellectual lrother getting wet in the process ii put to bed and dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that gorgeouslycovered and cleverlyillustrated magazine london society has also issued an extra christmas number containing no less than fourteen stories and poems we cannot say much for the merit of the letterpress but many of the illustrations are pretty and wellengraved and we hare no doubt that the stories some of which are by wellknown authors will be found sufficiently amusing by those less surfeited with this kind of literature than we confess to being at present  beotons christmas anual  is a thick shillingworth of tales burlesques nonsense mintkids a rid dlas the ptlnoipia story called snumbet see is by no means auingo but the old fairtales i a chinese doiste clet and the illustrations to them our list must cnclude with the  christmas number of the cbmie now the miotity of the articles in this are not worth noticing but the description of the hardships undergone by a  supet in a pantomine is grapluc and well illustrated and the  diary of a late cannibal which is man fridays view of the character of robinson crusoe is novel and amusing  christmas books4 bat year is felt as severely in the bookmarket as in any other it is not surprising therefore that our christmas literature is somewvhat scarce considering the general state of trade in the case of our annual we are compelled to go to press before the publishing houses have quite made xp their lists of christmas publications and in consequence  our table is not so full as usual we pass under review with great pleasure such books as have already arrived and in the december number of our magazine hope to be of some further service to our readers in recommending to them the best friends for their winter hours of leisure the office of a magazine reviewer is more to suggest than to criticise strongly the reader who turns to our pages for notices of books may rely on candid advice and be sure that consideration for the interests of the public alone leads us to offer it  the rose and the lily how they became the emblems of france and england a fairy tale by mrs octavian blewitt london chatto and windus this is one of the prettiest books of the season and particularly recommends itself to our notice the subject is not a new one but it may safely be said that none but a transcendent genitis can at the present day find anything new in fairy literature the whole world of imagination in this direction has been already ransacked and although new beauties may be added to the old originality is almost impossible mrs blewitts work is very far above the average her imagination has vigour and colouring while the language in which she clothes her conceptions possesses considerable power and derives grace and elegance from a cultivated mind and a ladylike sensibility she has chosen the sweetest of flowers for her discourse and strives by her story to inculcate in the young the duty of selfrestraint the misery of faithlessness and the still more important lesson of the real place occupied by the truly penitent we are too apt to consign the frail sinner to eternal punishment the poor lily is not only forgiven for her want of trust in the protection of the fairy titania but allowed to look forward to happiness when the expiation of her sin is complete and she ultimately has the high destiny of blazoning the victorious standard of the french monarchy the rose by contrast is not so prominently remarkable but her story as interwoven with that of the lily has its own charm and the little volume will be highly appreciated by all persons of poetic fancy in an age when most literature is or tends towards being prosaic much of the grace of poetic phraseology must be stifled or cut out but mrs blewitt has not behaved badly to us in this respect here and there the poetess breaks forth and generally the diction is pleasing one or two little bits of verse are noticeable for their delicacy as also the contrast brought into full relief between the english and the french fairies as typical of the lighter genius of our neighbours the frontispiece of the work deserves especial notice it is a most beautiful and charming design instinct with poetic and high artistic fancy from the pencil of george cruikshank executed by the veteran artist at the great age of eightythree for the sake of this engraving alone the book is worth adding to a library from the same firm we have  boudoir ballads  and  gastronomy as a fine art the latter translated by r e anderson mia from the work of brillatsavarin the former is essentially a  made  book and notwithstanding the high praise accorded to mlr sterrys verses by some weekly journals we cannot but express our surprise at the productions of a rhymester many little better than mere doggrel beingthought fit for publication in this most costly form it is impossible to speak too highly of the care and labour bestowed upon the book by the publishers there is something exquisite about paper print and binding the sight of such a work makes us long to present a copy to every young lady of our acquaintance and we have not we think ever seen a volume more artistically designed and produced from title page to finis it is rather disappointing therefore to find the matter contained in the 2 i 7 pages of the most meagre proportions though we must owvn to a feeling of rejoicing that there is no more of it the fact is the verses were written for magazines and weeklies and might well have been allowed to remain there here and there one alights upon some beautiful sentiment but at the same time strangely mingled with it comes into the memory a sunny afternoon when lying beside some faroff stream we revelled in praeds poems at times too we catch the ring of the lighter melodies of betterknown poets and not infrequent is our reminiscence of mr mortimer collins these observations refer to the best of the collection and of the rest we cannot speak in terms of admiration there is a lack of dignity of manliness of all that should characterise a poet in rhymes on a 8 cas girdle  a chinchilla mufi7

without any of the lovemaking and nonsense which to our minds is extremely undesirable in the pages of a book offered to the young miss nash shows a good deal of knowledge of young people and their likes and dislikes and although she loses no opportunity of inculcating a useful lesson she does not continually point a moral and add as so many writers do  this is a moral but leaves the reader to find out her meaning taking care that it shall never be too obscure the book is nicely printed and contains a rather larger share of matter than is usual for books of this description the new firm in arundel street remington and co have sent us isabel st clair a romance of the seventeenth century though it might just as well have been written of any other time the authoress is miss julia addison who has already made some way in the literary world and established a reputation as the writer of girls books and light stories we cannot say there is anything remarkable in her last work but it is agreeably written and possesses some points of interest original incidents are very difficult to be had for a book of this kind the range of which is naturally limited it would be a great mistake to criticise such matters too severely the young heroine is the daughter of a staunch roy alist and comes into the front place in our estimation by a daring act of bravery she rushes into the flames of the castle to save a valuable casket and is as one might expect only rescued by a miracle after this terrible catastrophe our interesting heroine removes with her mother and brother to a quiet cottage they having been dispossessed of the burnt castle by an uncle of a very bad typein fact a1 babes in the wool uncle all oxer miss sinclair has a fancy for doing whatever her mother tells her not to do and in consequence of this failing is run off with and nearly upset by a pony her rescue by an old witch and her subsequent seizure by a gang of the most desperate robbers that ever polluted the country with their presence form the next incidents in the clutches of these villains she improves and develops many brilliant qualities but it is best to leave her with the terrible lawless and his companions and let our readers if we have said enough to interest them in the fate of the fair but wilful girl follow her in her escape from a dreadful death and a return to her fond mother and brother at another time of year mliss addisons book would have stood little chance of success but coming as it does at christmas time we have no doubt it will be fairly popular with juveniles there is not one word in it which can be thought objectionable for the young to peruse in saying this we accord no slight praise to the latest work of the authoress mr arthur h moxon of 2 1 paternoster row sends us a beautiful and unique instalment of a noble work plutarch is one of those classics which will never lose its hold upon the minds of scholars and the beautiful illustrations of mlr j moyr smith designed after the manner of the early greek paintings are in themselves worth possessing every one is too well acquainted with the story of theseus to need a wordh upon its merits as a grand narrative of the life of a hero of old mr smith has taken some of the most powerful scenes in the history and illustrated them with a xvigour and dexterity equal to anything we have lately had the pleasure of looking at the work of which we have at present only one portion wvill when complete be eagerly sought after and cannot fail to add to the artists high reputation for study and intimate knowledge of the beauties of the ancient masters bosh by wv s london bickers and son i leicester square is a most amusing imitation of mr edwvard lears  book of nonsense the author openly confesses his plagiarism and apologises for it by a graceful dedication the rhymes are however only the accessories to the drawings in which the grotesque element prevails the draughtsman possesses more than ordinary ability for this class of work while his labour has been produced in the volume before us with every regard to the obtaining of the full effect of his comical genius particularly comnic is the portrait of the gentleman who is thus described there is a young man at devizes whose feet seem of different sizes the fault he imputes to the make of his bootsand perhaps from that cause it arises and one may fairly notice  an old penron of staines who s accustomed whenever it rains in haste to run out and stand under a spout and there for some time he remains the illustrations to these verses and others are highly amusing the same firm send us the song of the bell and other ballads paraphrased from schiller by arthur mills mp  and we cannot speak too highly of the care bestowed upon these translations mr mills understands thoroughly the spirit of the original and we particularly recommend his  gods of greece  as an addition to the repertoire of penny readings the other poems translated and paraphrased make us regret very much that the author has not given us a few more specimens of his choice rendering of the original poetry in our own language shall lie live again remington and co is a poem sillgularly appropriate to the time of year all christendom rejoices over the advent of the saviour whose missioii was to inculcate the truie sith in mans resurrection the

christmas volumes will be more generally welcome than this most popular of dickenss christmas books illustrated bv one of our most popular artists the art of mr rackham is in its way as unique as the art of dickens and in  a christmas carol  he has a theme that is exactly suited to his genius pickwvick might have been too beefilv real and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while he worked the result is a beautiful and ideal edition of the ideal christmas story  a christmas carol by charles dickens 2s 6d net chambers a dickenslover of our acquaintance makes it a rule every christmas to read those of the masters novels which deal with yuletide he maintains that it is an infallible method of suffusing his mind with that  christmas atmosphere the loss of which is a common matter of lament in these prosy and practical days there are probably many others who find that the magic of dickens is similarly potent for them and the present christmas will especially call for such a source of refreshment for the spirit a welcome may therefore be extended to from dickens christmas carol chambers this new edition of  a christmas carol with its fine bold type and coloured illustrations by a j keller  a christmas carol  will always have an abiding place in the affections of the general reader it is not merely that the characters are life  like but that as someone has aptly said of dickens  he is a portrayer of living souls rather than of living men it is here that the secret of the great novelist is found to read a christmas carol with a responsive mind is to be brought into rapport with the essential spirit of humanity and to be awakened to the true meaning of fellowship with the world especially the struggling heroic and kindly portion of it the present repoduction of covy chambers volume should make an acceptable a n d a p prop riate christmas gift to all but those crabbed souls if in these days there are any left who think it an article of literary dignity to abjure dickens and all his works  christmas books the oldfashioned plan of upsetting travellers or blockading them in the snow and so compelling them to tell each other stories by way of revenge has been faithfully adhered to in daniger etheringtons christmas annual but the travellers stopped by the breakdown of a railway bridge are a clever and amusing company the disappointed man  is well told while paul merritt and ernest warren combine to tell a singularly unpleasant story of siamese twins called told in a whisper but all the stories are of the ancient homely christmas fashion and the various authors deserve full credit for conforming to the pattern we cannot force any sentiments of gratitude for gifts and favotirs for i 88 i kerby and endean dr olloed as the author calls himself manages to utterly weary the reader with his story

practice of cornish wesleyan methodists are described in a manner which shows that mr silas hocking is intimately acquainted with the people of whom he writes but we hope that he has evolved the

against being misled by the frontispiece into imagining that the great napoleon stood eight feet in his bootswe were tempted by the preface to stories of long ago john walker and co into the fond expectation that mr ascott hope had discovered some really unknown or forgotten stories in the gesta romanorurn the lais and fablianx to which he alludes but the stories of  the abbot and the emperor  the anchorite and the angel and  the physician against his will are not quite so forgotten nor is their disguise as impenetrable as he would seem to fancy the punishment of the emperor jovinian seems very poor after the legend of king robert of sicily which mr hope will find in leigh hunts  jar of honey from mount hybla however everybody tells old stories at christmas time and doubtless to many of our young friends these will be as good as new and they certainly deserve full praise for the pure and simple style in which they are narrated of the century of illustrations sorne are humorously conceived and well engraved but they differ much in quality there is a maturity about several of the new fairy or semisupernatural stories of lord brabourne which like exceedingly dry sherry requires a cultivated palate but the aountain sprites kingdom george routledge and sons is sufficiently fantastic for juvenile readers in its quaint humour and riotous fancies which are admirably aided by the illustrations it stands alone in the volume which contains also a story of ancestral and demoniacal rooks who aid the true heir against the lawless tyrant of rookstone we are puzzled by unintentional transformations of the baron fitzuron into the baron fizurse and in another tale of count benjanisi into count benjamin which are probably wrought by typographic diablerie at the conclusion of the volume we ask ourselves if the peer can have renewed his youth by the publication of some early stories by the commonert1he jamaica rebellion of i 865 is an almost forgotten story which ails ricks

christian knowledge but he has succeeded in presenting in a readable volume a great deal of information as to african discovery beginning with sataspes and hanno and ending with livingstone it is well nowadays that the labours and discoveries of the portuguese and english explorers should be kept in view lest the modern travellers loom too large in the foreground and obscure the mighty past of african discovery the wornout theme of the mutineers of the bounty has been taken up anew by mr r m ballantyne in the loney island james nisbet and co by the binding together of the wellknown facts

fairytale order though they are not to be reckoned among the oldfashioned folk lore rose leaves and chit chat by puck swan sonnenschein and allen are rather we think suited for young old folks than young little folks in that misty and fantastic borderland however both ages meet and it is rather a question whether these tales with their veiled meaning hidden under the guise of the preternatural

told in glowing language the compiler who is careful to refer his readers to the authorities whence hie has drawn his knowledge has fully felt and lresented  the charm of the virgin forests of borneo the rich veetation of the i and of fire the valleys and woods of sumatra the beautiful landscapes of celebes and gilolo the island haunts where gleam the brilliant and beautiful birdsofparadise and the as yet little known country of new guinea we can only regret that there has been hardly any space accorded to the history of the spice islands and the later conquest of java amid the wonders of nature and the accurate descriptions of the various races there would have been room for some account of the massacre of amboyna and of lord mintos expedition which transferred for the tine the rich dutch colonies to the possession of england the same publishers have issued a new edition of california and its wmonders which has been revised and brought down to the present time so at least we are told on the titlepage but we think that the account of the produce of the pacific silver mines is hardly up to the present yield there are fairly good illustrations to assist the verbal descriptions of the natural wonders of caleveras and the yosemite valley the astonishing productiveness of the soil assisted by the climate of california is briefly but clearly noted the work will serve as an introduction to the closer study of the state whose capital is known as the city of the golden gate from this country of the present and the future we turn to dr newtons in bible lands t nelson and

and therefore instructive guide to stayathome travellers ltie adventures of frank powderizorn t nelson and sons carried him to captivity among a tribe of pampas indians after a shipwreck on the coast of the argentine republic and an experience of life as herdsman to an estanciero there are some descriptions of real life which the author mr j sands vouches for as part of his own experience and some illustrations made from sketches taken by him on the spot there are also numerous bad verses dreams and a good deal of filling but the book is meant for boys and will amuse and instruct them the prose is better than the poetry and the poetry is better than the illustrations in the belgravia annial chatto and windus the frontispiece presents a most ungraceful young lady across the meadows gliding

condemnation of verse and pictures in favour of a proverb and  the heiress  is passably nice of the stories  prince saronis wife  is the best though gloomy with the shadow of one of those mysterious crimes that julian hawthorne affects the colonel is a sketch after bret hartes manner and is worthy of recollection and lkotation so like the prince is a pleasant piece of whimsicality in which mr egmont hake so humorously depicts the infinitely little of a german high transparency that when the unlucky valet who has irofited so well by his likeness to the reigning prince is assassinated by mistake even the murder seems a joke to the amused reader t lhe reduced dinner party  should be read before going to hear dr carpenter on london fog tile longest story of the three in the gentlemans

confusing one in unpractised hands of a series of connected stories told by different actors in the drama the heroine is a jewess whom a young irish nobleman marries and prac tically deserts so that she is literally left to starve and perishes in a vain pilgrimage to establish her own and her childs rights we would remind the authoress that earlscourt is not an imaginary title there are some powerful descriptions but the story is confused and hopelessly improbable the nephews and nieces to whom 7he necklace of ptincess fiorimonde macmillan and co is dedicated may be congratulated on miss de morgans talent for telling fairy stories there are six others in the tasteful volume lit up by walter cranes illustrations the cruelty and punishment of the beautiful but hardhearted princess are well relieved by the exquisitely pathetic story of  arasmon and chryseia there is a purpose worth seeking in these tales which is patent enough in  the bread of discontent  and  the pedlars pack but the experiences of  the wvise princess  will sadden elder readers while it hushes into tearful gravity the awestruck little ones  the heart of princess joan  vividly recalls some of the indian stories which miss maive stokes has collected the charming little maid whom kate greenaway depicts upon the frontispiece of little wideawulake i88o george routledge and sons will be perhaps rewarded for her

arranged alphabetically under headings thus if we look up u appetite1 a passage from cymbeline assures us that it is the best sauce for food  and if we look up  mustard  we find a quotation from

and the passages are in most cases long enough to be interesting tales of nethercourt by the rev h c adams routledge is a book for boys full of the glories disgraces and ambitions of schoolboy life  while miss roberts fortune by sophy winthrop routledge is eminently a girls story the heroine of which is continually eating orange and writing her aspirations in a padlocked diary they are both

dress and her puffed sleeves is bewitchingly lovely while the archtyrant looks dreadfully severe in a faustlike scarlet costume with his big keys athis waist but the most admirable conception in the book is  sister anne the importance of whose role our artists have hitherto failed to recognise doubtless fatima was charming but we have always felt that sister anne was the superior character and hitherto like many heroic women she has had all the work and none of the play mr walter crane however has made her full compensation by giving her a grecian profile and mounting her on the battlements

consulted all the best authorities on his subjects and has produced a very readable and useful book hymns and poems for little folks cassell petter and galpin is a delightful volume for nursery reading and contains as many pictures as poems to those who want as much paint as possible for their money we recommend the national nursery book an illustrated selection of known fairy tales and

and tlowers for the dinnertable and drawingroom the illustrations are remarkably graceful and the volume is sure to be a favourite giftbook although the subject seems scarcely suitable to the present time of year we recommend thc christmas volume of the peep show strahan and co as deserving especial notice it is a cheap and lively serial for young people and its illustrations as well as ita letterpress are above the average of juvenile serials the goalen harp album routledge a book for children of all ages is a collection of stories and verses beautifully printed and contains 150 excellent illustrations by watson pletach and ilertzel the works of canova with biographical memoir by count cicognara chatto and windusthis large volume one of the very largest of the christmas books contains a very complete illustration of the genius of canova outline engravings however carefully executed cannot tell much of the quality of sculptureits beauty of workmanship or magic of lifebut they can present fairly enough the scope and height of an artists invention that is what is very fully done for canova in the present volume by the aid of these severe outlines that avoid both the trials and the triumphs of more complete realisation we are able to judge fairly enough of the quality of the italian sculptors imagination we see the extremes of strength and tenderness which he could command and note the variety no less than the limitation of his genius we use the word genius for no one who has studied any of canovas works would be disposed to doubt that he was a very genuine artist whose sympathy with the antique ideal was always sincere if not profound we cannot too often remind ourselves that the greek art known to students of the second half of the last century was a thing very different from the greek art that we bow down before today there is scarcely a greater difference between michael angelos sculpture and that of canova than there is between the elgin marbles and the medicean venus and to the eighteenth century the medicean venus was the type of the antique in finding for this type a new expression in modern sculpture canova showed a very just appreciation of the value of his model the lighter grace of later greek art is translated without serious loss into the elegant forms fashioned by his own chisel nor is his a mere cold reproduction of the original there is a new element in the forms he created which gave them a real hold upon the admiration of the time that affectionate tenderness always taking graceful utterance which is so entirely characteristic both of his epoch and of his own work is enough in itself to prove that canova had reshaped for himself tie material of greek art and had so far truly assimilated its spirit as to be able to stamp it with his own individuality and if proof were needed that the artists taste was true and unborrowed it would be found in the immediate recognition which he accorded to the elgin marbles  i introduced canova first to the marbles writes hamilton in a letter to the painter haydon  and i never shall forget his attitude of astonishment and delight when gazing upon them as if they were really motionless living figures and when he said  oh that i were a young man and had to begin again i should work on totally different principles from what i have dope and form i hope an entirely new school this admiration of the greatest product of greek art truly and spontaneously offered is not unlike the praise lavished by reynolds upon michael angelo and although it was no doubt absolutely sincere in both yet neither approached in his own work to the qualities of the ideal reynoldss domestic grace was in fact closely allied in essence to the affectionate tenderness of canovas nude forms both men were entirely in sympathy with the temper of their time and both would have equally failed had they attempted to realise what they perceived to be of higher significance besides the outline engravings the present volume has an interesting memoir by the count cicognara and full descriptions of the various subjects engraved among warne nnd cos publications we have two little volumes of old and new testament illustrations by the rev hobart gaunter dd two pretty little stories entitled  the basket of flowers  and  the story of the robins from the  home circle series  and a

forms a serial story in it while the names of hans andersen george macdonald henry kingsley miss cupples and tom hood appear on the titlepage its illustrations are plentiful and good and we cordially recommend the book to christmas purchasers baron bruno and other fairy tales by louisa morgan macmillan is the prettiest collection of stories we have seen for a long time one and all are graceful and dreamy little prosepoems with something of the bewitching pathos of hans andersens little mermaid and eleven swans the authoress has blent the real and fantastic very cleverly the tates of greybearded german sceptics ardent young sculptors pretty little princesses and peevish monarchs are interwoven with the fates of starborn goddesses ocean beauties virtuous fairies and evil seakings aud the chief charm in the book is the way in which these mystic beings are for the time in spite of their wings and halos and scaly tails endowed with warmth and breath and are full of human gladness and sorrow it is to be regretted that the book is written in language scarcely simple enough for children even of twelve or thirteen years old in childrens books and in fairybooks especially there ought to be scarcely a wordwhich cannot be easily understood by a child of ordinary intelligence wherever there are two words to be had the more homely should be chosen even though it be less pretty than the other for very often what is eloquence to us is gibberish to children  and though perhaps in this case an authors vocabulary be curtailed yet the simplicity gained is a beauty in itself and the gratitude of his little readers an ample reward for his trouble but the present volume will find readers who are no longer children and who will appreciate its go od points without stumbling long over its long words the little boys own book lockwood and co is a chubby little volume containing hints and directions for every  kind of sport and pastime imaginable it is furnished with numerous engravings and would be a very good book if the type were not so terribly small if such books as these continue to be published there will soon be a demand for lilliput spectacles merry tales for little folk edited by madame de chatelain lockwood and co is an excellent collection of wellknown ballads and fairy tales and if people will have the old dishes cooked up every christmas they cannot have a better bill of fare than this  both mrs guernseys books purport to be chronicles of the stuart period and the dialogue is appropriately archaic not only in language however but in plot and characters is there the closest similarity between the two both the heroines are governesses in a noble family where there is a sickly child called betty who has disease of the heart and requires perfect quiet in either case the governess is the ministering angel of the house and in either case she captivates the only eligible young man that the family can boast of equally jealous heartburnings are hereby caused to other claimants who think themselves better entitled it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these two books have been successively compiled from identical materials the latter being an improved and elaborated edition of the former  christmas books first article the tide of literature specially prepared for christmas seems to set in earlier and more heavily every year much of it of course is only called christmas literature because it is published about christmas time and because being particularly adapted for holiday use by its showy bindings and profuse illustrations as well as by the lightness of the writing that is between the covers and the pictures it is thus thrown by the publishers into the competition by which bookbuyers and presentmakers are iemp to cater for their children and their friends at the most giftmaking time of the year the bookseason has now fairly begun and the weeks orer0htm ef mainly devoted to the publication of the lighter sorta of books most of which are as good reading in pnngtime and summertime as during the winter holidays today we shall notice more or less briefly a score of these books first in the list may be placed mr daws picture by charles robert leslie virtue containing steel gra of nine of the artists most characteristic picturs  with a compreheve description and with a tolerably f u j memoir as an introduction to the series mr dafforne overestimates leslie and some of the engravers have done him great injustice by their slipshod treatment of their subjects the volume as a whole however makes an attractive drawingroom ornament and is not merely oma mental it illustrates a phase in the history of english art and fairly shows what sort of an artist leslie was it opens with his  sancho and the duchess which was one of his earliest studies though this particular picture waa not painted till 1844 and ends with his charming  olivia nearly his latest production of the other pictures here copied the best engraved are  sancho panza a florisel and perdita  uncle toby and the widow wadman and  falstaff and his friends the last named being by far the best in the volume christmas carols new and old novello of which the bev h b bramley has edited the words and dr stainer the music and which contains fiftytwo pictures as well aa tunes to the fiftytwo carols is a disappointing volume most of the illustrations are poor and though much care haa evidently been taken in collecting the best carols and some of these will be new to nearly every one who nsea the book we should have preferred greater accuracy in the reproduction of both tunes and words the delightful old carol beginning joseph was an old man and an old man was he and he married mary queen of galilee for instance is needlessly mangled though it is quite true that to suit the prudish tastes of the day one or two verses might properly have been altered mr bramley however does not mend matters by writing as they went awalking in the garden ao gay maid mary spied cherries hanging over yon tree for as joseph and mary walked through the garden gay where the cherries they grew upon every tree and he sins more gravely than in this verse hans andersens tales are always favourites and every child who is lucky enough to possess the selection of hia fairy tales sampson low and co that mr ward and miss plessner have newly translated is to be congratulated the series consists of eight stories  the wild swans the ugly duckling and the snow queen being among the number the volume is illustrated by several colourprinted illustrations from e v bs drawings some of which are very good indeed in pictures of this sort the colours are generally so thick and coarsely laid on that all artistic merits are hidden and some of the illustrations in this volume are thus injured  but others are very successful especially the sketch of  the old woman with cuckoo shortlegs and the cat who wouldnt associate with the ugly duckling that of  children playing in the water alarmed by one of the mermaids approaching the shore and that of  the old witch combing gudas hair with a golden comb to make her forget her friend there are several other and less gorgeous volumes with coloured illustrations intended for small children chimes and rhymes for youthful times routledge is a collection of generally poor verse fitted to a great number of illustrations by oscar pletsch who is always good many of these however appeared last year in a volume entitled childlife and were then much prettier as plain woodcuts than here with their thick coatings of colour the favourite picture book for the nursery nelson contains fewer and bettercoloured if not better designed illustrations the pictures of the little man who had a little gun and went to the brook to hoot a little duck and of the little old woman who lived in a shell and whenever she wanted her tea got plenty of water from out of the sea are particularly good the only fault in this showy volume is that tonie of the rhymes facing the pictures are very silly a l 0 e picture story book nelson is not so well illustrated aad the prose stories contained in it are rather preey texte are freely sprinkled through them and the morale are spread over the tales instead of being tacked on at the end for wise children to skip the same authors sunday picture book nelson is better in every way it contains twentyeight short poems in which the religion is in place sketching the life of christ and the only faulty pictures are that of the  crucifixion with its ugly blotches of blood and that of the  resurrection suggestive of a pantomime tableau the book of the year for many children is a wonderful collection of household tales and fairy stories boutledge in which fortynine famous nursery favourites are supplied with three hundred and eighty pictures most of the pictures of course are old like the stories but they are none the worse for that seeing that mr harrison weir mr h k browne and mr gilbert are among the artists the stories have been well chosen and the series includes cinderella the sleeping beauty tom thumb little bopeep the five little pigs jack and the beanstalk and many other tales as good foremost among a heap of boys books before us is a new edition of robinson crusoe nelson reprinted from the first edition and supplied with a tolerably good life of defoe and with a hundred woodcuts many of which are capital for this very pretty volume some thousands of childrenand we are all children if it is childish to enjoy defoes masterpiecewill be thankful as a sort of companion to it we have another of mr w h g kingstons tales for boys which is also profusely and tastefully illustrated entitled on the banks of the amazon nelson it recounts the adventures of some boys who  after encountering various dangers in their journey over the cordilleras followed almost the same track as did the gallant gonzalo pizarro to the banks of the napo and thence descended the mighty amazon to the atlantic mr kingston wisely prefers to give plenty of adventure instead of working out an elaborate plot in his stories and he has a happy knack of mixing up a good deal of natural history with his narrative taking care that the mixture is pleasant as well as wholesome all this makes his books very interesting his ben burton sampson low and co is a tale of the sea shorter than  on the banks of the amazon and more of a regular story mr j t trowbridges jack hazard and his fortunes routledge is a smartlywritten and enjoyable account of the adventures of an erie canalboy who by honesty and enterprise worked his way up in the world we can do no more than name the hon charles murrays prairie bird routledge a north american indian tale and mr tom burgesss harry hopes holidays what he saw what he did and what he learned during a years ramble in country places routledge  the latter purporting to be stories that have no pretence to be aught but simple transcripts from the tablets of the past of some bright scenes and green spots on  memorys waste penned in the intervals of other labour but amid the dear scenes of our loved midengland among talewriters for girls the authoress of c when i was a little girl takes high rank nine years old macmillan is a sequel to that charming book and though it professes to be only the  little potatoes  of the writers childlife left behind when she dug up the larger ones and presented them to her readers last christmas it is a very acceptable dish whether the readers are nine years old or twice thrice four times five times six times or seven times as old they must enjoy this pretty volume who will not be glad for instance to hear more about grandmamma gower  the brightest merriest funniest old lady you ever saw who had very bright blue eyes and wore three little grey curls on each side of her face which shook about like silvery wings whenever she laughed or turned her head whose voice was  like a bell so bright and merry and musical and who  didnt make you feel like saying your prayers a bit  a book like this needs no other pictures than those that the authoress draws with her pen  but it aas a few very jolly woodcuts by mr frolich who when he does justice to himself hardly has a rival among artists of childlife mrs whitney writes for older children and for children trained to like religious sentimentalism and other things that should be shunned by all rightminded people but her real folks sampson low and co like her other books gives some insight into american life and is written with some literary ability the lady of provence or humbled and healed nelson is  a tale of the first revolution  by a l 0 e who in writing it has kept in view the story of naaraan the leper as being a striking type illustrative of an important scriptural doctrine we have classed this book among girls tales although one of its objects is  to lead masters and servants to feel that the connexion between employers and employed like every other social tie may be ennobled and strengthened by that faith which unites into one body all the ransomed people of god the same authoresss golden fleece nelson hardly a tale is meant to show that our good deeds must be judgedand few will bear the trial by our purity of motive and strength of selfdenial fourteen short stories by the same writer are collected in a little volume entitled the hymn my mother taught me and other stories nelson in aunt jennys american pets griffith and farran miss hopley gives much interesting information chatty and yet precise about the birds of the united states hummingbirds thrashers yellowbirds and ever so many more it is unkind of her however to put naughty thoughts into little boys heads by describing the cruelties that she says the young negroes are fond of practising upon any birds that come in their way and the mischief her description may do is not mended by her  try not to think of it dear children  christmas books weills village tales from alsatia 1 admirably translated from the german by sir alexander duff gordon comes very fitly at the head of our third batch of christmas books thb collection which originally appeared in the feuilleton of a strasburg newspaper exhibits somewhat painfully but we apprehend with much truth the harsh realities of peasant life in the district to which it pertains according to the authors own showing there are in al sa tia abundant materials for the happiness of a race whose country is fertile and whose social condition is far from unenviableno vexatious interference with civil or religious liberty existing  but to picture an arcadia docs not seen to have been the bent of his inclination he has chosen for his theme the vices and the frailties which are dependent on no particular locality but are common to all the world yet in treating his subjectsand this with considerable ability he has not failed so to interweave his incidents with the customs and habits of a people rarely described as by the force of local colouring to invest them with a strong interest apart from that which the story itself imparts the tales in the volume arc only three in number there is among other pictures a good characteristic illustration of selmel the crazy girl and her ton suitor  and the translation as is customary with sir a d gordon shows a perfect acquaintance with the colloquialisms and niceties of the germnn tongue and flows as easily as if it were the language in which the tales were originally written the heroic life and exploits of siegefried tke dragon slayer 2 with illustrations by kaulbach and printed in the square form and legible quaint type of a century and a half ago is a book for midsummer dreaming as well as christmas reading it will send back young and old to the grand times of heroic personal adventure when the age of chivalry itself was but beginning these exploits of siegefried form a fragment of the niebelungenlied that celebrated cycle of the romance of early germany the narrative is told in a clear vigorous style as if every sentence were meant to tell like one of the heros swordstrokes  but its simplicity by no means takes away from the effect of the marvels related kaulbachs illustrations are in excellent keeping the juvenile verse and picture book 3 profusely adorned with marginal and other illustrations in the style and good taste peculiar to mr burriss publications and admirably engraved on wood makes also a pretty present for the season the subjects are agreeable selections among the shorter poetical pieces of some of our best writers scott southey cowper gray and others so with a book of stories for

annerl 5 is one which has notably taken its stand among the romances that give a portraiture of lower life in germany and like most of the works of its accomplished author ranks high in public estimation there we do not think it likely to lose any of its popularity by its english dress it is a melancholy and very touching story those who are unacquainted with the writings of brentano will find a good acfount of them together with a short biography of the author in the introduction a new and very portable edition of gullivers travds 6 needs little wcommendation from us beyond thai which

folks a brief indication of their names and natures may be useful to those who have to choose giftbooks for the rising generation for the very young we see nursery nonsense a thin volume in green and gold filled with funny rhymes and laughterprovoking engravings more advanced young folks may be treated to the happy home by henrietta luslhington where they will have it made clear to even rather dull capacities that to be good and to be ihrppy are really one and the same thing luke ashleigh by alfred elwes describes schoollire in holland and gives a very pleasant description of the country and as we should think from personal observation parents and guardians ought to be obliged to mrs henry wood for her tale of william allair or running away to sea which is well calculated to induce boys who are well off on shore to remain so yet it is written in no spirit of antipathy to the sea and sailors the lad who goes against his parents inclinations is shown to have a hard time of it and a miserable end but harry vane who is an affectionate dutiful youth has a happy and prosperous career the tale leaving him a lieutenant in the royal navy whilst william allair dies in an indian hospital lastly we have historical tales of lancastrian times by the rev h p dunster which are all founded on real events and very pleasantly convey a good fund of information about the manners and customs of england and france in the fifteenth century all the books we may remark in conclusion are well illustrated and attractively bound and any one who may express himself dissatisfied with them we should consider very hard to please  christmas books george stanley or life in the woods by john c geike routledge warne t routledge an interesting and instructive account is given in this boys book got up much in the style of captain main reids volumes of life in the western parts of canada the story is cast in the form of a narrative of the experiences of a settlers fainily and is sustained throughout by vivid descriptions of scenery adventure and the occupations of ordinary canadian life young folk will read with pleasure the chapters on ice and fist thunderstorms insect plagues and winter amusements an interest ing account also is given of the manufacture of sugar from the maple tree though written for the rising generation this is a volume from which older people

bears black panthers and indians the author has certainly succeeded in producing a most amusing christmas book for boys written in a clear graphic style giving an excellent idea of life in that part of america and the habits of the indians the heroes of the tale are walter taylor the nephew of an english settler and a negro servant known in the family by the name of the  black panther the negro being the subject of contention between the tailors and the indians from the latter of whom he had run away the story throughout is most interesting marian and her pupils a stryj for girls by ciiaiuorrre lankfster routledge lwarne  huttledge the theme of this little volume is the everyday life with its incidents of joy and woe of a young lady who takes pupils to board and educate though object being to amuse and instruct little girls the pupils occupy a more prominent place in the narrative than the teacher and their little troubles and pleasures are portrayed with much vividness and truth to nature the style is clear and attractive and a good moral tone pervades the story and leaves a wholesome impression on the mind of the reader busy hands and patient hearts or the blincl boy of dresden from the german of gustan niert1z jackson 1w alford  hodder there is no mistake as to the charming style of german tales which germans alone can write with the simplicity which so much interests children the first chapter in which little magda comes early in the morning to master tanzer the potter with a broken cup to have mended is enough to seal the character of the rest and we promise our young friends that they will not be content until they dive into the other chapters and read of the blind boy the hard landlord and the merry christmas with all the other exciting but instructive incidents of the volume which is one we can without hesitation recommend fireside chats with the youmgsters by old merry jackson walford c5 hodder this is a series of tales for boys old merry has made them his favourites and does not condescend to amuse the girls each chapter is a chat on a separate subject but the chat is all on one side as mr merry like most storytellers is fond of spinning a yarn and monopolising the conversation to himself he tells his young hearers of  boys without hearts shams and mir braggadocio grumblers and building castles in the air also about fairies who are people that are constantly doing good a few words even about  giants old merrys efforts will we have no doubt afford amusement to his youthful hearers the history of poor match by holme lee smnith elder t co this is a tale of doglifeas worthy any day as a tale of a doll or of a cat or even as  the tale of a tub as petdogs often occupy a foreground in the daily amusements of young people so the story of poor match is the story of all his little companionstom hugh and augusta cecy and mary who petted and spoiled him match however whose name sadly enough was eventually changed to the vulgar one of  mickey remained to the end a good dog and died lamented and honoureda pattern for his canine fellows to imitate  christmas books  u v ii 2 l  we have already noticed singly some of the

canterbury pilgrims of 1388 from the best manuscripts and designs available to herexcept lord ellesmeres and the cambridge university ms both in the hands of the chaucer societyand has given in chaucers words and modern rhyme his description of his fellowtravellers together with five of his tales best suited for young readers the knights tale of the fight between palamon and arcite for emilies love the clerks tale of grisilde and her uncomplaining sorrow the friars tale of how the wicked summoner was carried off to hell the franklins tale of the magic moving of the rocks of dorigen

directions for the pronunciation of chaucers english and versions in modern rhyme of all passages quoted from him a life of chaucer and a steel engraving from his pupil hoccleves portrait of him in the harleian ms 4866 make the book attractive as well as workable it must not only take a high place among the christmas and new year books of this season but is also of permanent value as an introduction to the study of chaucer whose works in selections of some kind or other are now textbooks in every school that aspires to give sound instruction in english mrs haweis has tried the experiment of teaching chaucer to her own little boy not only telling him the tales in ordinary mothers talk but reading him extracts from them in the pronunciation that our highest authority mr alexander j ellis has decided must have prevailed among educated englishmen in the fourteenth century she now asks other mothers to try the same plan with their boys and girls and feels certain that they will be able at once to interest and teach their children on her plan while though drawings of the old dresses the description of the old english pilgrims and their ways will stir the young folks interest in the history of their homes and land in a way which catalogues of kings of israel or details of battles statecraft and the like can never do and surely those who know chaucer his roguish fun his love of nature birds and books his fresh boys heart his care to teach lewys his  lytel sone must feel that there is in him very much to draw children to him and they will be glad at least to try whether mrs haweiss pretty book from the daisies on its cover to its  notes on the pictures  at the end a labour of lovewill not bring their little ones some of the sunshine and pleasure that the

hut is  selected from the best authors and the pictures as the writer of the preface truthfully remarks speak for themselves mildreds mistake a stilllife study by a levien marcus ward this is a hook that young maidens will delight in who have not yet reached the advanced period when they like sauces with their food and a spice of sensation in their novels this period unfortunately arrives at the present day very early and to juvenile readers of miss braddon ouida rhoda broughton and others such a book as mildreds mistake which deals simply with the wellregulated loves of four very nice and wellbehaved young ladies will doubtless seem rather tame but those who like fair amoret have been carefully  trayned up from time to time in all chaste virtue and true bountihed but who yet are beginning to find that there are questions for them to answer of even deeper consequence than those set by the local examiners will be likely to find much to interest and even guide them in their

families in whose homes a mild religious atmosphere prevails and who celebrate christmas chiefly as a high festival of the church will doubtless find this pretty giftbook wherein the story of the nativity is told in simple verse and by means of softly coloured illustrations in thorough harmony with their sentiments the pictures which are executed it is stated in xylography from the paintings of l diefenbach are weakly reminiscent of the early italian masters kaspar and the seven wonderful pigeons of wiirzburg by john goddard marcus ward a pleasant german variation of the theme of alice in wonderland instead of the usual parodies on wellknown verses children are here given a translation of riickerts tender little poem  the strangerchilds holy christ but the sympathetic tears that this may bring into their eyes at starting will soon be dried by the delightful fun that followsfun without any furtive attempt at imparting useful knowledge the  ancient grofulus  is of the genus bandersnatch but the spinning princess is of the genuine old fairytale stock and so beautiful that plenty of little boys we imagine besides kaspar will fall in love with her wise little linda with her firm belief in her brothers marvellous adventures is also very charming  thank you good pigeons for the pleasant hours you have given us is what many other little dreamers besides kaspar and linda will say this christmas annies pantomine dream by else j davis moxon this is one of the numerous stories to which alice in wonderland has given rise it is in fact a remarkably close copy of that now classic work only in the present book a perfidious counsellor named knowledge is ever present among the dramatis personae whispering and insinuating scraps of moral advice and scientific information

to me prices now are doubled things are dear you see so a sixpence isnt what it used to be but even this it will be perceived savours somewhat of the school board the clan of the cats true stories about feline animals seeley the clan of the cafs includes not only the familiar members of catland proper but such distant foreign relatives as the leopard the lynx the panther the jaguar the ounce the ocelot the tiger the puma and the lion the acknowledged chief of the clan so that an acquaintance with puss really involves a considerable knowledge of natural history the book is illustrated with thirtyfive woodcuts many of them very good and the stories are simply told and are sure to please intelligent children public and private life of animals sampson low translated from a french work published some ten or twelve years back which owes its popularity to the admirable illustrations of legrand which are here reproduced his spirited groups of animals and the human expression he has contrived to give to their faces are perfectly inimitable fairyland tales and legends from the german of villamaria marcus ward the story of the  kings daughter derives its source from the fate of pharaohs host which according to scandinavian legend found no rest in the depths of the red sea but were changed into seals and sent to though cold waters of the north the superstitious reverence in which the ladybird is held in germany and the tyrol is told in the story of  holdas paradise and many other popular legends gleaned from old chronicles will prove a welcome christmas offering in their

new south wales to whom he was engaged in happier days she faints as he in his capacity of cabinbay hands her a bowl of strawberry ice c kc the boole is crudely written but wellintentioned and wellprinted though it looks too much like a book for children which it most distinctly is not through picture land by c l matteaux cassell petter and galpin this is certainly one of the prettiest of the christmas books for little children both pictures and letterpress aro delightful and there are two or three capital silhouettes in it bright rays for dull days and pictures for happy hours cassell petter and galpin are also bright little books full of pictures and short stories which the children will like tom thumbs picturebook routledge is full of coloured illustrations and contains as well as tom thumb bluebeard aladdin ali baba and jack the giantkiller aud the sleeping beauty the illustrations are vivid but the effect of putting letterpress on the back of the pictures has been somewhat to confuse the print a night and a day by ilesba stretton henry s king and co is a touching little story of a pitman who ventured his life to rescue his friends m danger ilesba stretton writes with strong human interest and gives a certain amount of charm to every subject she touches on the two bartons j clarke a little hook for village boys which has drawn its chief inspiration from the teaching of the late prof maurice the story shows the influence which a thoughtful young schoolmaster acquires over two brothers of opposite characters developing all that is best in both the book has so much that is good and healthy about it that we wish the class for whom it is written had been more carefully considered village lads will not know what sam froid meansnor will they much appreciate quotations from in memoriam at presenthut little stories like the two bartons are a great improvement on those of the  goody  order and an author who can write with so much sympathy will with

volume of a series well known and very welcome to the public the madonna cannot easily be separated from our christmas thoughts and her legends of which the largest portions are concerned with the nativity are of course peculiarly in harmony with though spirit of the season in which we are ali endeavouring to connect thoughts of mutual good will and kindness with the celebration of the birth of

graceful writer and a truehearted woman among readers of her own sex she has here written in an unstrained simple way a tale interesting in itself and womanly and pure in purpose the tale is especially adapted as a quiet little gifthook for young ladies who have passed their childish years for younger ladies or for boys who like to read the story of a girl there has been written a pleasant little volume entitled ashbell ll by miss hooper it is a very wellwritten story with a few illustrations by which it will be made further palatable to the young people who are to feast on its contents another attractive and very appropriate book for the young readers of a family is a story of the russian campaign translated from the german an historical novel on a small scale entitled the

easily another of these small historical novels of which the story is connected with the french revolution of 1848 is adolphe benouard 13 a stirring tale which has the benefit of being very copiously illustrated it is the pictorial christmas tale issued from the office of messrs ingram and cooke pictures of a higher classthough those last mentioned were excellentwill be found in a childbook called

flying off from it to the subject of comets or if we do the subject must be our excuse a neat little book containing a popular account of comets 24 by as sound authority as mr hind will certainly be chosen by a good many who seek giftbooks for though young the subject of comets is as wonderful and full of interest even to many ofthe young as any fairy tale we name this volume therefore among christmas books we might almost add to it the german conversation book 5 of mr bernays founded as it is upon the happy plan of substituting for the dull dialogues of the old school dialogues of an amusing kind fitly selected from the german drama or wo might add among our christmas books the account of iwchew and the jjcwcheuans 2g by the bishop cf victoria which while it pleads for the support

the last of the four tile llzuntaia nelson m michlelet writes fancifully if not fantastically the chief characteristic of his books being as he says that  they attempted not to give a meaning of their

little soul and whether the earth which for present purposes is made up altogether of mountains has a heart an allpowerful organ in which its energies are made manifest by which it aspires and

oriental fable which represents the various animals as assembling to consider the cause of all their woes and of the raven clinching the controversy by saying my friends what we are seeking lies under our very noses i perceive what this evil is and how futile will be all attempts to propitiate it for it is clear that man insatiate man is our devil  this work not too long to be read in halfanhour is

for children about  the world at home and the sea and its wonders here furnish half a hundred short and interesting chapters concerning the gay birds of the tropics the hues and features of which are

fashion the former claiming to be  of a high order and the latter designed to be  a bunch of neverdying flowers culled from a few of the thousand and one gardens of british poetry and prose some of the woodcuts are good but the letterpress is not always well chosen even shelleys  skylark and wordsworths  lucy and bumss auld lang syne can be quoted too often as the volume contains but one extract

had it not been stolen from our table and secreted in the nursery there to be devoured at leisure by a small critic who found in it a solution of the old impossibility of eating a cake and having it too this is lady bark rs best book it gossips in the pleasantest way possible about the christ mas experiences in england jamaica india and new zealand of a lady who certainly must be the authoress who used to be constantly surrounded by boys and girls in a chronic state of storyhunger but who fortunately i never seemed to tyre of telling all that they wanted to hear the stories here told consist mainly of illustrations of emigrant and native customs in the colonies and are all very interesting and save for an cccasional touch of horror very wholesome mr lewis carrolls through t le lookingglass and what alice found there macmillan is a sort of sequel to  alices adventures in wonderland and though hardly as good as that altogether delightful book is quite good enough to delight every sensible reader of any age it tells with wit and humour that all children can appreciate and grown folks ought as thoroughly to enjoy how alicein a dream as she afterwards found outbroke through the drawingroom lookingglass to look at the furniture that was the reverse of all that was around her and then entered upon a series of wonderful adventures among red kings and white queens and all the people of the chessboard saw funny things without number met with humpty dumnpty and other wonderful people and heard and herself sang queer songs of all sorts and the best of all is that the book has no moral and is nothing but a capital jumble of fun from boston we have in 2mfother gooses melodies for the nursery sampson low and co a very complete alphabetical collection of the good old nursery rhymes with the various english readings and some american adaptations with critical and historical notes chiefly taken from mr halliwells nursery rhymes and popular rhymes with musical

fair one with the golden locks each told in verse by mr francis davis and mr tennysons  sleeping beauty with gorgeous illustrations by mr marcus ward in antique style and printed in colours and gold there is quaint humour in the pictures and each story is supplied with music arranged or composed by mr b h carrol each is also issued as a separate book as nursery books very fairly illustrated there have been published the three little kittens the three white kittens the three good friends and our fourfooted friends nelson the same publishers have also issued four packets of colourprinted cards one containing a picture alphabet another bible animals another birds of the bible and another garden flouwers the first are well fitted to entice small children into learning their letters and the last are really artistic productions in cramers christmas carols we have a very cheap collection of music quite appropriate to the season fourteen carols some of them old enough to be novel are here brought together with the original melodies or with good and easy settings by fresh hands where there are no old tunes to be used   christmas books higgiedypigyledy or stories for everybody and everybodys children by the right hon knatchbullhugesseii longmans green and comr knatchbulliiugessen dedicates his little books to the silent members of the house of commons and takes this opportunity of eulogising their unselfishness in abstaining from speech and allowing the business of our representative assembly to proceed he inscribes it to them he tells us becausein the tirst place its title admirably describes the condition in which the business of the house usually is and also because the stories themselves were written within the precincts of the house it is apparently mr hugessens custom to sit in the gallery during those debates to which he does not care tc listen and in this retreat to conjure up for himself a temporary utopia of fairies goblins mermaids prophetic pigs and all the rest of his puppets this pleasant occupation is interrupted only when the division bell tinkles  and mr hugessen bids goodbye to dreamland just in time to record his valuable vote whether he confounds fairy tales and politics on these official occasions we know not but it is to be remarked that a very decided political vein runs through the whole of his fairy stories perhaps it is his design to supply politics and satire for  everybody and pigs and squirrels for  everybodys children   but we cannot help thinking that his senior readers will show little interest in the pigs while the little ones will object to the solitics how can children be expected to understand mr inatchbulliiugessens admirable witticisms concerning poaching the game laws publicans and county magistrates his funny little allusions to school boards to church controversies and to wifebeating  his sounding but not very navel remarks concerning female suffrage and his little squibs at charitable institutions  a not very pleasant feature of the book is the jocular and rather unchivairic tone in which it speaks of women we object especially in a book intended for children to the use even in fun of the words  female and petticoat for  woman and to the systematic bringing out in clear relief of all the little frailties and foibles of the weaker sex which a witty  stronger vessel  can manage to gather together the book is nevertheless clever and amusing and a great improvement upon mr hugessens last christmas volume its matter is more interesting in itself and its style is simpler and pleasanter though its author still indulges in too many long words and still  takes as we once heard a juvenile critic say of him  a very long time to say a very little thing1 among the many contents of every boys annual routledge for this christmas may be mentioned a complete nautical story by jules verne a series of papers on  modern magic  winch explain many popular and startling tricks and

my eye and lark but it is on the whole well written and likely to be a favourite tell me a story by ennis graham macmillan is a volume specially adapted for small children who will delight in its woodcuts and in its simple and homely phraseology its author sympathises thoroughly with all the tiny joys aud woes of the nursery domain thc young surveyoi low and co is a story of american life and manners and those not of the most refined kind it abounds in yankee dialect and survey measurements and we hear of  perdickerments  clar soapgrease  theodolites  transitinstruments and  doggoneations whatever they may be the illustrations are so bad that they might have been executed with the surveying instruments of its own hero it is a lamentable fact that our storybooks are illustrated as a rule much better by foreigners than by englishmen french drawings careless as they often are have a spirit a drollery and a grace peculiarly their own but the quaint careful cleanlycut german illustrations are always the greatest favourites with children who will pass over any amount of french wit or sentiment to admire the stolid back of a little german babys head the volume of chatterbox for 1875 gardner contains its usual supply of amusing and wellwritten stories the illustrations are less than usually artistic but it is to be supposed that small readers are not hypercritical and that for them a very little suggests a great deal on this account a juvenile journal cannot be too plentifully illustrated even where the pictures are of the roughest and most commonplace kind so long only as the artist contrives to suggest ever so dimly what is in itself beautiful and good at the same time now that some of our best artists condescend to illustrate childrens books the older folk who buy these books are becoming more fastidious and our children will not be long in following their example thc childrens prize gardner another serial contains some pretty music with words which children will easily learn to sing sunday heading for the young gardner is a combination of amusement and instruction which reminds us of the dose of physic hidden in jam which most sensible children strongly object to its cover is characteristic a vindictive little old lady in spectacles is represented in red and blue hearing a small girl con her sunday lesson while at her elbow stands the naughty boy looking extremely uncomfortable in a fools cap we thought that the day for such trash as this had long since passed by little wideawake routledge is a collection of stories and verses for children the print is largea great point in juvenile booksthe pictures are in some cases extremely graceful but the verses might be better mrs sale barkers book is likely to be a favourite with her little readers the modern playmate warne and co contains the rules and modes of playing every game which is in vogue in the present day besides many that are new or forgotten there are chapters also on archery boating sailing shooting fishing swimming skating and pedestrianism we have playground games games in the snow outdoor games indoor games and games specially adapted for winter evenings at home among thee last may be reckoned charades of which there are given two very elaborate specimens or models the volume is full of amusing matter and will be found extremely useful as a holiday handbook national natural history warne and co is a collection of pictures and notes of animal life the print is excellent the notes are short and readable and will with their coloured illustrations amuse children as well as instruct them the plays for children by miss walker routledge include five plays two only of which are original the rest being taken from hans andersen and grimm these last are not close translations and it is a pity that miss walker has been obliged to add so much dreary dialogue in the process of dramatising the old stories ju doing so she has converted pretty simple tales into dull and spiritless plays but although tiny are scarcely lively enough to tempt children to learn thin by heart and to act them they will be read with pleasure an1 may help to illustrate

the malioiou back ward look of the hoary jew the enemy who came and i sowed tares in the night abroad in the field with the hyena and the snake while the night gathers over the last gleam in the western sky he looks back in malicious triumph at the light in the householders chamber as he clutches with one hand the great bag of tare seed slung over his shoulder and with the other scatters evil seed from a full palm admirable again is the whole treatment of the group of the foolish virgins against whom the bridegrooms door is shut and mr millais is at his best also in his illustration of the parable of the good samaritan and 1 that of the lost sheep or of the prodigal son we have by no means equal regard for all the designs but the work is beyond doubt full of the noble thought of an artist who4 has the true gift of genius to spend upon a theme of which i he feels with all his heart the dignity in such books lies the best worth and honour of our christmas literature an edition like this of mr millais illustrations to the parables is not only a credit to the publisher it is a credit to the country at the head of the childrens storybooks for christmas 1863 we are glad to be able to place a cheap edition of the storybook of storybooks the arabian nights bntertainment 2 somewhat abridged and cleared of those passages which in the eyes of judicious parents are to the young a stumbling block we never knew or heard of in the bygone generations of the young a child who read the real original arabian nights and found sensuality where judicious age finds eastern fancy over fervid but this generation of children is said to be precocious and our boys and girls are pronounced little men and women so perhaps they may not be invited to a bright revel of fancy with the old confident sense that to the pure all things are pure so be it the stories are here pruned skilfully by the hon mrs sugden not very much spoilt and therefore acceptable everywhere it is the business of every judicious man at this season to ascertain whether he has a nephew or niece son or daughter in so hopeless a state as never to have read the  arabian nights and to provde for the right education of all who are in that case by supplying copies we fear that there are many poor children in the land who know none of the stories of the barbers brothers and have never dreamed of prince camaralzaman or rubbed aladdins lamp unhappy creatures who have no better christmas hope than that papa twill buy them peter parleys annual 3 here it is the original parley is gone but his annual is edited by

since by edgar taylor have been collected by mr bohn into a threeandsixpenny volume of his  illustrated library with the pictures by george cruikasban and ludwig grimm mrs t k hervey too is entitled to some thanks for endeavouring not unsuccessfully to provide children with a new christmas book containing some reminder of the substance and the spirit of arthurian romance the stories in her feasts of camelot and the tales that were told there 5 are too clearly modern antique to please the student of old literature have in fact no more flavour of king arthur than a tale of old time by the author of  mary powell is able to suggest other sort of talk than that which is conceived over the modern tea and muffin yet the child wiil be pleased and we are grateful to the lady who does not write parleywise but seeks to bring the bright tints of romance into the childs workaday life if it be true as we fear it is that many children even of the rich who might be better l cared for now live workaday lives and suffer by star 4 vation of their fancies perhaps less entertaining to a young child but more genuine romance of the old time is a transformation by mmr or miss emma letberbrow of

the ambras library in the tyrol it was then lost sight of for centuries and rediscovered about  forty years ago its first edition appearing in the first volume of hagens i heldenbuch this english

it is very possible that some children may find a want of exciting incident or regularlyconstructed story and that the charm of the true picture of childlife is rather greater for the elders than for the children of a family but whether or not that be so this book about children and a pet dog that the old read throughout with a smile of pleasure must come near to the hearts of the young with whom the writer shows herself to be in such delightful sympathy the book is hardly to be called a tale but as a cheerful and true sketch from the child world it is one of the happiest and wholesomest

those of a good sturdy english sort who like to come in contact with the spirit of adventure and read about deeds of daring which is all right and justifies some toleration of these boys books of adventure a toleration seasoned only with strong hope that the young readers do not carry away a morsel of the information they disguise mr j g edgar is bent on historical romancing he hau done danes

but we are not yet at the bottom of the pile of holiday literature for this christmas 1863  a christmas carol bv charles lickfkens with 8 illustrations in colour bv honour c appleton  net simpkin marshall e very christmas brings us a new edition of at least one of dickenss immortal christmas stories we are not prepared to say offhand how many different artists have interpreted the christmas carol  since john l eech illustrated it on its first appearance but we have no hesitation in saying that miss appletons eight paintings are worthy to rank beside the best of those illustrations by her many predecessors she is not much concerned with the humour the grotesquerie of the story but we doubt if the poetry the grace the tenderness and fantasy of dickens were ever more delicately or more sympathetically depicted than they are in her drawings her scrooge should have been a little grimmer a little harder of feature perhaps but her tiny tim and bob cratchit and the rest of his family are delightfully natural and human she is very successful too in dealing with the eerie ghostly elements of the narrative her wintery nights have the hue and atmosphere of winter and the spirits that haunt them are veritable things of mist and bodiless we congratulate both artist and publishers on this beautifully illustrated and tastefully produced edition of the best and most popular of dickenss christmas books  christmas storiese ceaistms stories are according to some running a race with the  chronicles of the fleet prison from the papers of the late alfred seedy esq by charles roweroft 3

successful embellishment of standard literature or the illustration of works for particular objects scenie historical or scriptural are alone adapted for a competition of that kind christmas stories are peculiar to themselves and miss toulmin as a new competitor in this field has penned a truly beautiful domestic tale the story of a proud and wealthy man whose one son weds a governess and the other when at oxford gives away his heart to a lowly maid but both of whom are reconciled to their father by the partner of partners mr mierrythorpe the felicity of whose domestic lhearth is only rivalled by that of the discarded william hamilton  partners for life is we should think well adapted for the stage how mrs gorethe clever versatile mas gorecould write such a sad tale as this for a new years book we are at a loss to conceive poor dear little georgey we are miade to interest ourselves in his boyish simplicity his childish career free from vice and sin and his mysterious parentage for what to weep over his deathbed for the fountains of human sympathy must be dried up when tears flow not at so tragic a conclusion the perusal of this story mlay however chasten many a heart for

in notes the divisions arc also illustrated by popular introductory comments and the separate poems often by biographical notes on the writer which may be of use to the young the editor himself never goes beyond popular knowledge of his subject is content for example to explain yule in a note by saying  yule is the anglosaxon for christmas when it would have been much more to the purpose to say that it was anglosaxon for  the merry festival the name geol pronounced yeol or yule was originally applied to both the great feasts of the year and is derived from gal merry yule therefore means not christmas alone but merry christmas now that its name is restrieted to that single feast but the slight annotation with which the christmas verses are introduced will be welcome enough to the young

pictures match the text a hunted elephant charging a tree that has a negro king on the top of it has so many arrows in his hide that he looks like a christmas tipsy cake mr ballantynes storybooks of

past twelvemonth in monthly parts and now forms a very handsome volume well printed on good paper richly illustrated with a dozen coloured plates of exciting sport in chase of elephants lions tigers wolves bears and whatever else there may beferm nature there are also plenty of woodcuts scattered about the text which is no series of imaginary adventures but a lively compilation by mr james greenwood under the head of each beast that is hunted of what is most interesting to boys in the sporting adventures of the men who have distinguished themselves as its hunters there are portraits also of great hunters and the volume includes a map of each quarter of the globe showing in a popular way the distribution of animals over its surface for any boy with an interest in stories of the chase or in the history of all sorts of wild beasts this handsome volume of wild sports of the world will be a famous christmas box another seasonable boys book of adventure is produced by mr james grant author of  the romance of war jack manly his adventures by sea and land routledge and co but chiefly by sea here there is plenty of romance and peril of the good oldfashioned sort well told and illustrated striking pictures of african adventure form a part only of the range of incident the picture by mr keeley halsewelle of the executions from the baboon cliff is good enough almost to set a young heart throbbing very good too is the perilous adventure of a man lying on a ledge of precipice with bears advancing on him from above and from below the pictures which are all by mr halsewelle are not equal in merit but the power shown in one or two is beyond the common level a good storybook for girls is miss bowmans how to make the best of it routledge and coit being a stepmotherwhich

lucabor by his  iendly adviserd ntronio in comfirmation of the good advice given by him from time to time on all kinds of subjects among them are some wellknown tal like those of the fox who cajoled the crow out of its cheese and the woman who counted her egga before they were hatched but there is always plasure in seeing how old friends like these are dressed up and most of the stories will be altogether new to all but a very few readers the most pathetic story in the series is one telling how a certain count having been stricken with leprosy for defaming his wife was tended through all his degradation by three faitgful knights too loyal to allow their disapproval of his crime to interfere with their chivalrous devotion and how in the end they were rewarded for their labours here is a good story of a different sort three impostors came to a xing and told him they were clothweavers and could fabricate a cloth of so peculiar a nature that a legitimate son of his father could see the cloth but if he were illegitimate though believed to be legitimate he could not see it now the king was much pleased at this thinking that by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed fathers from those who were not and so be enabled to increase his treasures for among the moors only legitimate children inherit their fathers property and for this end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture of this cloth and these men in order to convince him that they had no intention of deceiving him agreed to be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured which satisfied the king  when they were supplied with a large quantity of gold silver silk and many other things they entered the palace and putting their looms in order gave it to be understood that they were working all day at the cloth  after some days one of them came to the king and told him the cloth was commenced that it was the most curious thing in the world describing the design and construction he then prayed the king to favour him with a visit but begged he would come alone the king was much pleased but wishing to have the opinion of some one first sent the lord chamberlain to see it in order to know if they were deceiving him when the lord chamberlain saw the workmen and heard all they had to say he dared not admit he could not see the cloth and when he returned to the king he stated that he had seen it the king sent yet another who gave the same report when they whom he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth he determined to go himself  on entering the palace and seeing the men at work who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of the invention as also the design and colour in which they all appeared to agree although in reality they were not working when the king saw how they appeared to work and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described and yet could not see it although those he had sent had seen it he began to feel very uneasy fearing he might not be the son of the king who was supposed to be his father and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he might lose his kingdom under this impression he commenced praising the fabric describing its peculiarities after the manner of the workmen  on the teturn to his palace he related to his people how good and marvellous was the cloth yet at the same time suspected something wrong at the end of two or three days the king requested his alguacil or officer of justice to go and see the cloth when the aglacil entered and saw the workmen who as before describod the figures and pattern of the cloth knowing that the king  had been to see it and yet could not see it himself he thought he certainly could not be the legitimate son of his father and therefore could not see it ile however feared if he was to declare that he could not see it he would lose his honourable position to avoid this mischance he dmmenced praising the cloth even more vehemently than the others  when the aiguacil returned to the king and told him that he had seen the cloth and that it was the most extraordinary production in the world the king was much disconcerted for he thought that if the al acil had seen the cloth which he was unable to see there cold 1o longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of the king as was generally supposed he therefore did not hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill of the workmen who were able to make it on another day he sent one of his councillors and it happened to him as to the king and the others of whom i have spoken and in this manner and for this reason they deceived the ing and many others for no one dared to say he could not see the cloth things went on thus until there came a great feast when all requested the king to be dressed in some of the cloth so the workmen being ordered brought some rolled up in very fine linen and inquired of the king how much of it he wished them to cut l off so the king gave orders how much and how to make it up  now when the clothes were made and the feast day had arrived the weavers brought them to the king informing his maesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he had directed the sing all this time not dating to say he coild not see it  when the king had professed to dres himself in this suit he mounted on horseback and rode into the city but fortunately for him it was sumner time the people aeeing his majesty come 1 in thismanner were much surprised but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers kept their surprise to themselves fearing the dishonour consequent upon such a declaration not so however i

attative of all in this ollection is one recounting m what happened to a young man on his wedding day in wh inl may have been the first rude suggestion of the plot i of the taing of the shrew  there lived in a city said patronio  a moorwho was much r respected 4nd who had a son the most promising youth in the world but not being rich enough to accomplish the great deeds which he felt in his heart equal to he was greatly troubled having x the will and not the power l now in the same town there lived another moor who held a r higher position and was very much richer than his father and 3 who had an only daughter the very reverse in character and appearance of the young man she being of so very violent a temper that no one could be found willing to marry such a virago b one day the young man came to his father and said you r know that your means will not allow you to put me in a position r to live honourably adding that as he desired to live an easy and i quiet life he thought it better to seek to enrich himself by an advantageous marriage or to leave that part of the country the father told him that he would be very happy if he could e succeed in such a union on this the son proposed if it were e agreeable to his father to seek the daughter of their neighbour in e marriage hearing this the father was much astonished and t asked how he could think of such a thing when he knew that no man however poor could be induced to marry her 8 nevertheless the son insisted and although the father 1 thought it a strange whim in the end he gave his consent the d good man then visited his neighbour telling him the wish of his a son i when the good man heard what his friend said he answered  by heaven my friend were i to do such a thing i should prove t myself a very false friend for you have a worthy son and it would i be base in me to consent to his injury or death and i know for cer tain that were he to live with my daughter he would soon lie or death at least would be preferable to life do not think i say t this from any objection to your alliance for i should only be too r grateful to any man who would take her out of my house the young mans father was much pleased at this as his son was so intent on the marriage all being ultimately arranged l they were in the end married and the bride taken home according i to the moorish fashion to the house of her husband and left to i supper the friends and relations returning to their respective homes waiting anxiously for the following day when they feared to find the bridegroom either dead or seriously injured  now being left alone the young couple sat down to supper i when the bridegroom looking behind him saw his mastiff and said to him  bring me water wherewith to wash my hands the dog naturally taking no notice of this command the young man t became irritated and ordered the animal more angrily to bring him water for his hands which the latter not heeding the young man arose in a great rage and drawing his sword commenced a savage attack on the dog who to avoid him ran away but l finding no retreat jumped on the table then to the fireplace his master still pursuing him who having caught him first cut off his head then his paws hewing him to pieces covering everything r with blood thus furious and bloodstained he returned to the l table and looking round saw a cat  bring me water for my hands said he to him the animal not noticing the command the master cried out  how false traitor did you not see how i treated i the mastiff for disobeying me if you do not do as i tell you this  instant you shall share his fate the poor little harmless cat i continuing motionless the master seized him by the paws and r dashed him to pieces against the wall his fury increasing he again placed himself at the table looking about on all sides as if i for something to attack next his wife seeing this and supposing i he had lost his senses held her peace at length he espied his horse the only one he had and called to him fiercely to bring him i water to wash his hands the animal not obeying he cried out l in a rage  how is this think you that because you are the only horse i have that you dare thus to disobey my orders know then that your fate shall be the same as the others and that anyone living who dares to disobey me shall not escape my yengence saying this he seized the horse cut off his head and hacked him to pieces and when the wife saw this and knowing he had no other horse felt that he was really in earnest she became dreadfully alarmed he again sat down to table raging and all bloody as he was swearing he would kill a thousand horses or even men or women if they dared to disobey him holding at the same time his bloody sword in his hand he looked around with glaring eyes until fixing them on his wife he ordered her to bring him water to wash his hands  the wife expecting no other fate than to be cut to pieces if she demurred immediately arose and brought him the water   ha thank god you have done so said he  otherwise i am so irritated by these senseless brutes that i should have done by you as by them he afterwards commanded her to help him to meat she complied but he told her in a fearful tone of voice to beware as he felt as if he was going mad  thus passed the night she not daring to speak but strictly obeying all his orders after letting her sleep for a short time he said to her get up i have been so annoyed that i cannot sleep take care that nothing disturbs me and in the meanwhile prepare me a good and substantial meal  while it was yet early the following morning the fathers mothers and other relatives came stealthily to the door of the young people and hearing no movement feared the bridegroom was either dead or wounded and seeing the bride approach the door alone were still more alarmed she seeing them went cautiously and tremblingly towards them and exclaimed i traitors what are you doing how dare you approach this gate  speak notbe silent or all of us you as well as i are dead  when they heard this they were much astonished and on learning what had taken place the night previous they esteemed the young man very much who had made so good a commencement in the management of his household and from that day forward his wife became tractable and complaist so that thqe led a very happy ufe a4w ivo jo f9oq go hsw bs aa
