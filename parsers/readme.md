parsers
=======

This folder contains code used to parse various bibliographic sources. Right now the central project is the *Book Review Digest.* Code used for that project is not contained in the top-level folders but in subfolders that are specialized for particular timespans.  ```/brd``` is actually for the ninteen-teens (1912-1921), and ```/brd1920s``` picks up at 1922.

Other code here is old and deprecated, or used for *Poole's Index.*
