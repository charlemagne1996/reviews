and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its author has so far given us	northamerica_contra
B3277	['8978958']	  the man and the moment by elinor glyn duckworth  co 6s mrs glyns latest heroine differs alike from elizabeth of the visits and caroline the passive victim of a didactic godmother she represents in fact a throwback to the  doormat type of midvictorian fiction and both she and her masterful admirer seem strangely out of place in a world which at present has little use either for supermen or sentimentalists the story though not overpossible is ingenious enough in its construction and breathes an atmosphere of saccharine amiability contrasting oddly with the authors earlier work	northamerica_contra
B7579	"['3163393', '6736772']"	  days spent on a doges farm this book perhaps need never have been written certainly it never need have been printed many however will read or at least skim its shallow pages and doubtless those will echo its praises most obediently who are first to fling it aside one cannot escape from the feeling that to plod through it is somehow a tribute to the authors father the late mr j a symonds to whom none of us can afford to be ungrateful for is there one who can honestly say that he has gleaned nothing from the harvest of the laborious historian of the renascence mr symonds judgement was however sometimes at fault never perhaps more so than when he sanctioned and even urged the publication of this work it consists of or more probably is based on passages from a desultory and impressionist journal intended for his amusement and on his daughters return his indulgence for her high spirits may well have been fortified by parental pride in the many promising features of her writing we are told that he  laughed at the crudities which he forgave that his  marks are over all the manuscript and that he intended to compose for it an historical introduction this project was defeated by his death for his sake we would rather believe that he would have revised recast and severely pruned for publication a manuscript that as an artless con fidential communication was harmless enough nay not with out its charms and graces but which says so little for the taste of the writer or the judgement of her censor it is indeed painful to decide who is responsible for so deplorable a breach of manners as is involved in the third chapter to say nothing of other errors that the authoress could and sometimes indeed does write pleasantly and effectively we do not deny but here she is working on bad principles and working carelessly lazily and erratically the subject is rather a promising one george sand would have handled it to perfection all that miss symonds has to say of value or interest she might have said in ten or at most twenty pages the rest is made up of endless repetitions trivial incidents and remarks superficial descriptions and rarely successful attempts at fine writing but its oddest feature is the tendency to literary practical joking the writer is always preparing us for something tremendously novel and interesting and then putting us off with the most ridiculous of mice take her chapter on the  flowers of the plain these turn out to be the usual habitants of our english ditches but our hopes revive as we read  the wonder of the flora appears in the first weeks of july it is the convolvulus rightly the americans have called that flower the morning glory but in spite of enthusiastic description it turns out that the only species are the two common english bindweeds surely the american morning glory is the annual ipomoea which our gardeners call convolvulus major again the real name of the village is vescovana its fancy name groomboolia is borrowed from a novel even the doges farm is a pious fraud no doge ever came there or lived there at all i must she says openly acknowledge that the title of doges farm was bestowed more for the sake of its new and pleasing sound than for any historical fitness in the term this however was the doing of the proprietress and miss symonds has merely adopted the attractive title for her bookcover not very much at least not too much has been written about the rarely visited euganean hills and the broad alluvial plain at their feet a consummate artist could have made a beautiful little book about them truly there is not very much to say about a region whose charm is its impressive monotony but all that is said should be in strict keeping the traveller should be alone or suppress his uncongenial companions he may describe the scenery as subjectively as he likes but he must maintain a mood in harmony with it now miss symonds has undoubtedly caught the spirit of such scenes and represents it not seldom as effectively as mr stevenson in his  inland voyage but unfortunately she mars the effect by careless selection by irrelevance and by the usual tourist facetiousness hence the meagreness of the book is only too apparent in fact to treat such a subject successfully requires firstrate talent and ripe expe days spent on a doges farm by margaret symonds fisher unwin rience you want to give the impression of breadth and monotony without being monotonous yourself you can not give it by perpetually repeating your sky effects and colour ecstasies as we have hinted out of the 250 pages of fine large print one could piece together about twenty or so of more or less permanent value the agricultural operations the buildings and the oxen are fairly sketched and on the whole one comes away with a more or less distinct impression of what vescovana is like in spite of the mystification and practical joking miss symonds little sketches also help one a good deal some are very pleasing but the botanical drawings are unsatisfactory miss symonds satire however demands a serious protest harmless enough in a private letter surely in print it is in bad taste if not offensive she more than once passed a considkrable time as a guest at the doges farm enjoying the princely if rather theatrical hospitality of its mistress she now holds up that unfortunate lady to public ridicule not even keeping back her name true she dwells also upon her excellent pointsher business capacity her versatile accomplishments and her munificence but the general fortrait is that of a clever parvenue driven crazy by an aristocratic marriage and by having her own way miss symonds hostess is it seems an englishwoman who married a venetian gentleman who was attempting to repair the fortunes of his house by farming on modern principles it seems the countess has the carts painted with his title  almoro the third though we gather from miss symonds that almoro iii flourished in the fifteenth century as a landlady and a farmer the lady has been very successful but as a countess she must be a burlesque if we are to believe what we read i prefer not to believe it there may or may not have been a doge in the familywhat venetian is not descended from a doge but the doges caps all over the house and even on the ladys hairpins are too shocking this comical portrait recalls thackerays princess de moncontour nee higg only it is more florid and eccentric the chapter called  first impressions under pretence of the confusion of mind caused by arrival at groomboolia gives a burlesque account of the ladys person conversation manners or rather lack of manners her ridiculous garden her flighty housekeeping and in short her general craziness aghast at this chapter with its wild and exaggerated descriptions of places and persons and indignant at the exposure of a hostess by her guest we turn to the next called  second thoughts which positively begins  the above description is not of course to be taken for a reality or for anything final any more than mark twains  tramp abroad  the authoress seeing she has gone too far thinks well to put in this caveat but she soon drops the point without explaining how much of her statements she wishes us to believe the most offensive certainly admit of no explanationeither they are true or they are false here and there later on there are hints which seem to confirm them thus then we are reluctantly forced to believe that miss symonds having very excusably made fun of her hostess in letters to her father is now so illadvised as to print these playful animadversions there is however a possible alternative namely that miss symonds feels sure that the eccentric queen of groomboolia is by no means averse to having her eccentricities advertised still it would perhaps have been as well to reserve them for her obituary we must add that the book is beautifully got up and contains promise of much better and more serious work in the iuure y y  bays spent on a doges farm by margaret symonds fisher unwin miss margaret symonds is altogether her fathers daughter and at every turn of the page she recalls the lamented author of the italian renaissance she has the same quick eye for picturesque form the same sensitive feeling for colour the same minuteness which is not quite convincing and the same naive and confidential egotism these qualities and defects of qualities are not so strongly developed in miss symonds nor are they set off by her fathers wealth of eclectic erudition but to them her book owes its genuine charm this is the less surprising because it was as she tells us written for him and under his influence and he had promised her an introduction  in which he was going to deal in particular with virgils connexion with lombard scenes mr j a symonds was indeed actually on his way to the doges farm where he hoped to write the preface when he fell ill he died in rome shortly afterwards and now she says  what i have written seems incompletea thing with though spirit gone out of it but my fathers marks are all over the manuscript and because he liked the book and took an interest in it and wanted me to print it i do so now and give it back to him an unmistakably pathetic meaning is thus given to the lines from the daisy placed underneath the dedication  o love we two shall go no longer to lands of summer across the sea the book is in effect an album of pen and pencil sketches made at vescovana on the estate of an english lady residing in the basso padovano the ladys husbandshe is now a widowbelonged to the pisani one of the famiglie nobili of venice who in the last century conferred a doge on the republic these nobles spent most of their time in the city of the lagoon and most of their money on their venetian palaces so that these country houses were greatly neglected the pisani doge never in fact came to vescovana and the title of doges farm has as the writer characteristically acknowledges been bestowed more for the sake of its new and pleasing sound than for any special historical fitness the country is like so much of lombardy simply reclaimed marsh and its fertility represents though lives and labour of many generations of contadini across it runs the adige not the noble blue river that swirls joyously through the piles of the scala bridge at verona but a breadth of sullen water moving between high banks and on the high bed of alluvium brought down from the alps  these banks are calculated to inspire something like panic in the mind of the ignorant observer they rise to a height of from twentysix to twentynine feet above the level of the land and the church spires and houses which once commanded are now shadowed by these mountainous banks standing on their summit you see the entire plain for miles spread like a map below you interminable fields of corn or maize stretching between ditches hedged by mulberry and willow with here and there a mud hut or a stable now and then a small thin campanile lu the far background faint shadows of the alps arise and on the breeze a suspicion of saltair is born from the invisible lagoon in the heart of this country lies vescovana whither in 1850 the english contessa came to a desolate home the family had before lived on the ground floor in the fine old palatial drawing rooms the linen hung on lines among the family portraits pigs wandered through the iron gates the threshing floors were before the diningroom windows hardly a tree or a flower was in sight but one curious remnant of greatness remaineda lions head carved ia marble by the door and under it the words bocca delle denoncie segrete though political espionage of the council of ten transferred to the petty jealousies of the paduan farm now all is changed there is a garden filled with tall chestnuts and catalpas grass and flowers cover the threshing floor paths wind among syringa hedges and tamarisks line the edges of the moat a longtailed tit builds in the bocca delle denoncie segrete and the lions mouth is filled with down not less wonderful are the improvements in the land on though farm and in the great grey cattle whoso beauty makes miss symonds justly enthusiastic the story of the transformation which is due solely to the energy of the countess is told with great spirit and the picture of this lady at once so unusual and so admirable a figure was well worth the painting for her the mass waits on sundays she orders physic to the sick oxen she fixes the day for the harvest though hour for the admission of the gleaners and all this intensely modern activity has for setting or background a peasant life which structurally is altogether mediaeval nothing however gives so profound an impression of her commanding personality as the story of the saving of the fields during the great floods of a few years back we ought to say that though we are not left in much doubt as to the actor who plays the part of the dca cc mach ina the authoress forbears to state positively that it was the contessa pisani miss symonds must be allowed to recount this moving incident in her own words   it had poured and poured with rain for many days and always it went on pouring up in the alps the torrents had broken loose and were hurling down their floods and boulders over the meadows  the adige was swollen yellow ghastly  but still by its banks restrained a dread aud a terror was in though minds of the people on the plain they went up in the evening to though top of the banks and looked then they crept down for a shudder passed through them  and still it poured  at midnight a gig rattled up to the gates of a lonely villa on the plain   though river has broken on the rovigo side suid though man inside  though people are mad they are coming across to open our lock and let the flood into our land as well as their own its a horrible flood but why should both sides perish r the lady of the villa arose she ordered her horses and she drove through the dark and the blinding rain at dawn she stood on thu banks of the adige beside her lock she was a woman but she stood thero alone and  shoot then shoot she cried to the men on the opposite bank of the river  they were all there half mad with fear they had their guns pointed at her but they didnt shoot and the flood went over their land and not over hers not less graphic is the account of the fire on the podere and of the contessa  in her gorgeous evening dress held up over a still more gorgeous petticoat storming at the crowd collectively and individually and then manipulating the hose with her own fair hands while all around the millions of frogs sang on and above was  such a heaven of quiet and indifferent stars no one can be more sensible to the beauty of the plain than miss symonds but she seems still more impressed with its melancholy the houses are clean the people are sober and thrifty without much beauty indeed except for the womens hair but all of them possessing she says  that charm of lithe and easy motion which is so hopelessly lacking in the mountaineer perhaps though the question of race has something to say to this for some of the mountain folk of the venetian tyrolareconspicuously graceful but any how at vescovana she noted th at even at the joyous harvest time they were sad and their very songs seemed weighted with misery she mentions too the frequency of suicide and quotes the explanation given of a suicidal youth who did not care to live because  there is never anything new the malady du sikle seems to have overtaken these poor peasants with a vengeance when they court death on such grounds miss symonds attributes it to the monotony of their lives the immense ennui of the great green seathe waveless plain of lombardy we are inclined to think that the vera causa is simply endemic fever miss symonds is to be congratulated on the success with which the local colour is suggested in these rough but spirited sketches they are all full of true southern warmth and appeal to us here with particular force whore every fresh winter makes us feel how right that savant was

B5277	"['8880211', '6788507']"	  the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained

is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters	northamerica_contra

really has all the faults her philosophical and critical jargon is hopelessly out of place and her chorus of girls with their frocks and their eyes are quite as vulgar as she intends and she has never learned how to write style she says with unconscious irony  style alone will give you a place in letters worth having but style is a land unknown to mrs atherton it is not for want of trying she  wordpaints conscientiously and strenuously and she clangs on every critical nerve consider this once she rode to the foothills escorted by dick they were covered with yellow and purple lupins miniature jungles which harboured nothing more sanguinary than the gopher and the cottontail the tawny poppies had hills all to themselves a blaze of colour as fiery as the sun to which they lifted their curved drowsy lips the mariposa lilies grew by the creeks in the dark shade of meeting willows the goldgreen moss was like plush on tile trees from the hills the great valley looked like a dense forest out of which lifted the tower of an enchanted castle not another signal of man was to be seen nothing but the excrescence on the big weddingcake house of a bonanza king beyond the hills rose the slopes of the mountains with their mighty redwoods their dark untrodden aisles their vast primaeval silences how it jars the ugliness of that plush upon the trees the grotesque discord of that confectionery simile nor has mrs atherton any more notion of structure than of ornament in fiction she has that terrible habit of beginning at the beginning the substance of the californians for instance consists in the varying relations of one man with two girls friends he falls in and out of love with each of them in turn and there is a good deal of play of temperament upon temperament a good deal of emotional crisis in the process this is all well enough but to get to this you have to work through a hundred pages of local colour and if you please a biography from childhood of the two young ladies in question all because mrs atherton does not know how to set the puppets working without it it was just the same in patience sparhawk it was just the same in american wives and english husbands tolerable the first time the device becomes irritating by repetition and yet when all is said and done mrs athertons are good novels you  pish  and  pshaw  for a while and then you feel that she is getting a hold on you her people are vigorously conceived and what is more they are interesting and they grow develop under circumstances furthermore she has an undeniable power of creating strong situations here is an example helena has taken magdalenas lover from her and after a short engagement throws him over she comes to tell magdalena that she has found him to he a man with an impure past magdalena knew this the knowledge the womans desire to save had been an element in her love for him her nerves are overwrought to the point of trying to kill her friend helena paused abruptly and caught her breath she had felt magdalena extend her arm and stealthily open a drawer in the bureau beside her chair there was nothing remarkable in the fact for in that drawer magdalena kept her handkerchiefs nevertheless helena shook with the palsy of terror the cold sweat burst from her body in the intense darkness she could see nothing only a vague patch where the face of magdalena was the silence was so strained that surely a shriek must come tearing across it the shriek came from her own throat she leapt to her feet like a panther reached the door in a  bound fled down the hall and the stair her eyes glancing wildly over her shoulder and so out to her horse it is many years since that night but there are silent moments when that ride through the woods flashes down her memory and chills her skinthat mad flight from an unimaginable horror through the black woods on a terrified horse the shadow of her fear racing just behind with outstretched arms and clutching fingers helenas sudden flight left magdalena staring through the dark at the spanish dagger in her hand her arm was raised her wrist curved the dagger pointed toward the space which helena had filled a moment ago i intended to kill her she said aloud i intended to kill her thisand this is only one of two or three equally strong scenes in the californiansstrikes us as really dramatic with a writer of less true instinct it would have been melodramatic but mrs atherton knows magdalena the spanish blood in her the starved life she led outside her love for the sinner make her and her

tains more detail and is altogether a more elaborate piece of work among women who have written american novels mrs atherton probably holds a position hardly contested by any rival there are however a good many modern english women novelists with whose method and style hers might be compared she secures an advantage over these ladies in the novelty and picturesqueness of the life and scenery with which she deals she is always vivacious and clear she can be sentimental without being mawkish but she seems unable to add the touch of delicacy and tenderness with which a great writer heightens the effect of his most vigorous studies from human nature in concentration of effect 4 a daughter of the vine shows an advance on 4 the californians it is a pity that the authors determination to be trenchant at all costs has led her in the later book to a conclusion which is almost brutal excessive length both of narrative and dialogue goes far to limit the interest of a passing emperor by robert shortz routledge  sons it is a story of life first at the united states military college at west point and afterwards when the hero and his comrade have been expelled in mexicoduring the days of the archduke maximilian otherwise the emperor maximiliano both sections of the book show the same lack of proportion in dealing with matters of detail and the whole volume amounts to little more than a wild story of adventure unsuited to boys as literature solely because there is a want of delicacy nearly amounting to impropriety in various places fighting and military movements are described with the same care and interest that appear in the same writers story of the days of napoleon in italy entitled  the gift of bonaparte the author in question now and then uses phraseology which stamps his writing as transatlantic 44the governors expected visit did not materialize your intentions were good though they did not materialize are instances that occur in narrative and dialogue respectively the story is told mostly in the first person by the hero a cadet of the united states army and a campaigner in mexico and the form of narrative adopted is not always successfully maintained we do not think the book ranks high as fiction though it gives promise of more interesting work mrs marshalls place as a writer of tales for the young is vacant and one may reasonably

easy at first sight to say why it should be considered a reproach to call a novelist sentimental and a compliment rather than otherwise to call him or her impassioned novels are supposed to be chiefly valuable as representations of different varieties of human nature and sen timent is as real an element in human nature as passion and perhaps a rather more common one so that it might seem to have at least an equal right to representation the source of the prejudice is to be found probably in a vague but not quite baseless belief that sentiment is more likely in pro portion than passion to find an unreal or false expression the representation of passion is subject to control or verification by the necessity of giving a credible account both of the person by whom the passion is felt and of the object by which it is inspired for it is only when both these are made clearly conceivable that the relation between them or the passion itself appears real and natural to the spectator if the circumstances described are those which in real life would stir deep emotions to which the characters in the romance appear insensible the work is commonly sensational if on the other hand the writer succeeds in representing men and women in considerable agitation of mind without provocation or upon pro vocation which would naturally induce a different kind of agitation from that exhibited the work may be called sentimental as fairly as if it had been deliberately intended for a representation of sentiment which is simply passion unattached a disposition to feel strongly about something or other with a degree of obtuseness as to the comparative claims of the different things about which human beings are supposed to be capable of feeling to excite the sentiment which the author chances to be able most easily to re produce iu two liftle wooden shoes ouida as usual does not get beyond a kind of sentimentalism which is however sufficiently effective to make it worth while to ask why on reflection the effect is always felt to be tricky and unsatisfactory the reason we inmagine is that the author aims directly at exciting in her readers the sentiment which she conceives to be appropriate to the situation always the same which she pre fors to treat instead of representing the situation itself with such commanding truth and power as to ensure a response of some kind even in readers who may take a different view of the situation from herself the consequence is that the situation is never realised at all even by the author and that which is realised by her and more or less effectively communicated to a con genial reader is a sentiment wandering at large amongst impossible occasions and therefore never more than half true tolifeand nature in the present instance the sentiment to be communicated is one of ianguidly reproachful acquiescence in the order of nature which causes a dreamy little flowergirl to come to an untimely end like one of her own rosebuds or as the author puts it having confidence enough in the theory to lay it down with epigrammatic generality m men are true children and women are their rosebuds now ouida notwithstanding a genuine fondness for children which is one of the pleasantest traits in her writings has never made the discovery that a healthy child is the most unsentimental of beings exactly because all its experiences are concrete and particular and if she had further been able to believe that in this respect the child is generally father to the man her heroes would have less of the appearance of being created a priori as the purely ideal correla tives of a natural disposition on the part of flowergirls and novelists to be very much inpressed by what they do not understand lady novelists especially are apt to imagine that they are realists as soon as they have 1 summoned up courage to disregardor i better still to invertthe oldfashioned rules of poetic justice but it is evident that something more is needed to complete the i portrait of a sinner than an assurance on i the last page of his impenitence and im  punitythough this may be true and plau x sible enough as far as it goes ouida however i never knows anything more of her heroes than  that they are very wicked very clever very t handsome and cause a great many flower c girls and others to drown themselves for t love of those superlative qualities but the f latter part of the process which the novelist  describes is not reckoned amongst the evii dence of the heros diabolical fascination  and craft because the sentiment of fatal awe a and admiration which attends his steps prei supposes a magic in his presence quite apart 3 from anything he can be made to do or say  on the stage in one way the present volume gains in veracity by its slightness be cause flamen a luxurious artist who wishes to paint a gretchen is not in evidence long enough to display qualities actively incompatible with the sentiment of which he is the shadowy object but then as his loyal worshipper b6beewho wears her little wooden shoes into holes by walking from brussels to paris when she hears he is illis something of a genius as well as a good and industrious little girl it is hardly fair to suppose her to be fascinated by a lay figure without any individuality at all the scenes descriptive of the quaint fancies and lonely businesslike life of the pretty young orphan amongst friendly villagers before flamen lends her paul and virginia are pleasantly drawn but as we advance the style becomes senti mental in the same vicious sense as the matter and meaningless refrains with a pathetic sound are used at intervals as a kind of warning that these are the places where it is desirable to feel as tearful as possible a good deal of sound virtuous indignation has been expended we cannot but think unnecessarily in denouncing the moral tendency of the fictions of this author and her school an admiring critic in the revue des deuv mlondes who gives ouida credit for a daring imagination rare in this country quotes her as silencing prudish objections by the assurance je n6cris pas pour les femmes jecris pour les militaires in which we should be tempted to see a piece of profound cynical selfcriticism if the slightest touch of humour in her works would allow us to suppose that she is herself not altogether imposed upon by the heroes who are probably admired by no living x men except perhaps very young officers in x regiments of higher social than literary i repute however this may be the little  wooden shoes will certainly not do any i harm to any one who does not make the x mistake of thinking the writing really fine i whilst anyone who is capable of making a such a mistake deliberately must have a 1 mind too impervious to literary influences i to be in much danger of suffering moral x deterioration from anything in print i mr robert turner cottons ideal of mas e culine perfection has much in common with e that of ouida but perhaps out of regard to i the degeneracy of the age he displays it less i crudely and as it were symbolically he s has a generation of young men who are t comparatively possible and prosaic but they  have a few surviving ancestors who in their r youth fought duels drank gambled and v made love on an heroic scale while towering r above the heads of even these distinguished f persons there appears the real hero mr a carington who arranged for them whom c they should shoot marry disinherit or d otherwise provide for while he was himself f4 too distinguished even to condescend to take r part in those aristocratic diversions which b he superintends in a grandly providential manner we are told that mr carington i when he could not find a good novel to read used to send to the circulating library for the silliest of the season and generally de lrived amusement from it perhaps mr cotton was not uninfluenced by this pecu liarity of his hero in writing what is more like a burlesque upon ordinary novels than a lserious attempt to achieve something more imaginative than even mr mortimer collinss tranemigration it is true that both these iworks are supposed to have really but one i author under different names the chief i reason being that in both all the characters have a habit of eating lobsters with enthusiasm at all hours of the day or night and that in both the poetical mottoes which abound are taken from the comedy of dreams which we gather to be an unpub lished trilogy in which things earthly and celestial do their best to look as if they were standing on their heads but have some difficulty in keeping in recognisable shape because they are released from obedience to the laws of gravitation as well as from the minor canons of probability we believe there are some people besides mr carington who do find novels amusing in which a great many things happen for no reason in particular and every one talks animatedly and with an air of deep con viction about nothing who prefer in fact a magic lantern to dissolving views and both to a panorama mr carington may be read without the sustained mental effort requisite to follow for instance a cunningly devised plot of mr wilkie collins and yet it con tains if possible more of marvel and mystery in the same space because none is wasted upon explanatory details or futile attempts to fill in the missing links of causation there is a russian prince who is so very wicked that nobody but mr carington can keep him in order and there is a russian secret society of which the late emperor napoleon iii was the headit is impossible to guess why as the final cause of the society seemed to be a desire to do something rather dreadful as soon as it could settle what to the russian prince the foreign office of course knows nothing about all these transactions till they are explained to a discreet subordinate by mr carington who we are given to under stand puts an extinguisher on the society by carrying off into cumberland and marrying to a friends son the italian lady who acts as the emperors second and aidedecamp it does not appear that the love and con spiracy  have any thing more to do with each other than is implied in the business of both being looked after at the same time by mr carington if we had to choose we should on the whole give the preference to the conspiracy half of the production for mr cottons ladies are nearly as bad as ouidas men though to do him justice he is content with traducing their manners and introduces no immorality to speak of that is less than fifty years old one young lady who we are told is a comical imitation of a stage chambermaid answers sufficiently well to the description but the real heroine elinor for whom the author professes unbounded reverence and admiration does not succeed in so demeaning herself as to make his boisterous assurances that she is the perfection of noble grace and gentle breeding appear as impertinent as such express statements would do if made concerning the absolute perfection of womanhood to say that the ideal lady is perfect shows a want of faith in the selfevidence of her perfections but to praise her in so many words for being ladylike is a positive insult or a confession of innate vulgarity for it is not more mar vellous for the ideal to be innocent of pert ness which by the way she is not than of pocketpicking the hero of transmigration has three lives one to each volume of which the first and third are spent on earth and the second in the planet mars the gere ral result of which seems to be that wherever lobsters and pert nymphs of erratic habits may be found man may enjoy moments of contentment but that for solid durable happiness it is necessary to be a schoolboy subject to flogging the book is not amusing because the author tries to play with his fancies before they are full grown and seems not to be quite sure but what if they were allowed to grow they might develop into a serious contribution to philosophy still the second volume is the least tiresome of the three though we cannot commend the modesty of this new dante who summons the great estese from the shades to act as his guide philosopher and friendly codevourer of lobsters the change of planet however seems to have moderated the length as well as the depth of the coleridgian harangues the chronicle of the ferniors is a chapter of domestic romance from the last century with the scenery carefully got up from contemporary memoirs and correspondence but the only justification for the second part of the title horace walpole itn love seems to be the assumption that horaces way of being in love would be to give no signs of the fact until the lady appeared to favour some other suitor in which case he would begin to satirise her mother there are no means of disproving the first part of the hypothesis but the second seems to prove too much for horace walpole can scarcely have been in love with the daughters of all the ladies of whom he has something spiteful to say in his correspondence the author scarcely succeeds in showing that he took more interest in lady sophia fermor than in any other famous beauty who was expected to marry one lord lord lincoln for love and was consoled for her dis appointment by the elderly but illustrious premier lord carteret there is an anachronism in some of the political wisdom which the duke of newcastle is supposed to bestow on his nephew lincoln who is to be consoled for the loss of sophia by the prospect of the government of ireland which has the advantage observes his grace of requiring neither skill nor knowledge it may be doubted whether the idea that skill or knowledge might be expected by a troublesome population from their rulers had so far taken shape in the ducal mind of the period as to be worth noticing even as a fallacy edith slmcox  two little wooden shoes two little wooden shoes a sketch by  onida author of  chandos under two flags c london  chapman and hall grotesqueness and vivid colouring the latter not always very carefully laid on are the prominent features of the later works of  ouida in the outset of her career and for some time afterwards she devoted herself to undisguised sensuality and the world was not a little startled in the nineteenth century to meet with a woman whose views of life were something more advanced than those of a pagan her language was not perhaps so objectionable as that of mrs aphra behn but her heroes and heroines were quite as impassioned the novelty to some extent wore off though the author cannot yet rid herself of that grossness which marked her former productions we know her theory of existence tolerably well by this time wines choice viands and animal passions are the gods of her idolatry the end of life is not to prove oneself worthy of it but to enjoy itnot utterly to destroy the intellect but to exercise it upon inferior objects and overlay all the solemnity of being with epicureanism and carnality the reflection is not a very pleasant one that books upon which such teaching is unmistakably stamped should attain wide popularity though we have as a setoff the confidence equally pronounced and unmistakable that this popularity can only be ephemeral time will ruthlessly sweep away into oblivion all the enticing trivialities of such writers as this in vain do we look through the numerous novels of  onida and their name is legion for some trace of an apprehension of the real dignity of man or woman save for the form in which it is enshrined humanity is bnt little superior to the beasts of the field like them man is to eat drink and enjoy and at the end of the farce their death is to be his likewise two little wooden shoes is in some respects an advance upon the previous stories of  ouida it is not so flushed with sensuous feeling nor is the expression so highflown but when we have diligently read it through we ask in amazement if this which has been put before us is all that the author has to offer touching the great realities of being she never gets beyond the rudimentary stage of existence her philosophy is sufficient only for children and dangerous for them and when the anal words of her story have been reached we find ourselves inquiring  what next   to tell a story well and with some degree of power is not all that is demanded of a novelist that were placing the art too low even through the garb of fiction man must receive something more than mere amusement but we suppose it is useless insisting upon this lesson as regards very many of our living novelists with a talent so inconsequent as  ouidas and one which is chiefly noticeable when describing the ecstasy of animal passion it is difficult to tell what to do we have the impression that but for these gleanings in forbidden fields her books would be miserable sustenance and therefore we are forced to the irresistible conclusion that it would have been better for her never to have written at all the owner of the  two little wooden shoes from which this story takes its name is one bebee a little peasant of brabant very poor and very bewitching when we first see her she has just completed her sixteenth year she dwelled in a little hut left to her by an old man who had adopted her illiterate to the last degree she is represented as never speaking without giving utterance to poetic thoughts and some of the sentences put into her mouth by the author we are constrained to say are really very beautiful bebee was in the habit of going to brussels to sell her flowers and was regularly to be seen under an awning fronting the maison du roi pursuing her avocations one day there came to her a strange customer in the form of a painter  he walked with an aey grace he was clad in picturelike velvets he had a beautiful poetic head and eyes like deep brown waters and a face like one of jordaens or rembrandts cavaliers this magnificent being was attracted by the beauty and artlessness of the peasant girl whilst she stood in awe of him the painter was called flamen but it was not his real name he had become famous in france at the age of twenty by painting a picture that brought paris to his feet he became still further famous by verses by plays by political follies and by social successes one year he wrote a witty political pamphlet that hurt where it was perilous to aim and he fled from the country a large portion of the story is occupied in detailing the gradual fascination which crept over bibles soul from her frequent interviews with the painter onida makes no scruple in telling us that he indulges the thought on several occasions of accomplishing her ruin but even his vicious soul is kept in check by her strong purity at length one morning he leaves her but promises to retain months pass on but he does not do so bebee hears that he is ill and travels on foot and in her little wooden shoes all the way from brussels to paris on arriving in that city she discovers his abode and rushing into his apartments to attend upon him in his sickness as she thinks she is appalled at the sight which meets her gaze we are not sure that we ought to quote  ouidas  description of this scene but a portion of it will serve to show that the author has not yet forgotten how to paint sensual pictures   she saw the dusky room as in a dream she saw him stretched on the bed leaning on his elbow laughing and playing cards upon the lace coverlet she saw women with loose shining hair and bare limbs and rubies and diamonds glimmering red and white she saw men lying about npon the couch throwing dice and drinking and laughing one with another beyond all she saw against the pillows of his bed a beautiful brown wickedlooking thing like some velvet snake who leaned over him as he threw down the painted cards upon the lace and who had cast about his throat her curved bare arm   with a great piercing cry she let the little roses fall and turned and fled at the sound he looked up and saw her and shook his beautiful brown harlot off him with an oath this passage does not occur in the mysteries of london but in a work published by a firm

B6564	"['3177338', '8909877', '6776895']"	  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed 6s john long smrs campbell praed is one of the most readable of the novelists of australian life to begin with she is more intelligible there is less slang in her books than is usual in australian novels so far as we remember no one in  the maid of tne river  cooks or boils a  bill whatever that mysterious article mav be in fact the only really unintelligible word which occurs in the book is humpy wvhat a  humps  is we have not the remotest idea but the rest of the book vould be intelligible to the rawest  new chum yet the whole atmosphere of the story is distinctively australian it is the work of one intimately acquainted with the country the local colour is real it is part of the book and not simply daubed on after a few months cursory studv the pljt is elementary it is the familiar story of the confiding girl and the fascinatin seducer and it suffers from the usual wieakness that ihe seducer is not sufficientiv seductive nuni destiac is a pathetic figure but her innocence is almost inconceivabbly childish and stewart the villain of the piece is such a heartless and repellent blackguard that we fail to understand nulnis preference for him lnfatuation of this kind is only explicable where there is real passion and mrs iraed is too far lacking il passion to make her heroines conduct convincing  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed john long this is another of the prolific authors australian tales and one of the best she has produced it has none of the improbability of her  fugitive anne and is more carefully and sincerely written than her last english story indeed it is a genuine and very painstaking piece of work the realism of which will at once be admitted by all who know anything of australian life we are chiefly concerned here not with the hazards and simple pleasures of the bush life which mrs campbell praed has often portrayed in the past but with the life of a young girl who after a childhood spent in pleasant circumstances upon her fathers station up country is taken to live in the colonys capital as the immediate result of the banks foreclosure upon her fathers station the father obtains an inferior government clerkship in the capital and thus our heroine after a youth spent amongst all the generous freedom of a squatters homestead is introduced to the somewhat squalid realities of life on an inadequate income in the poor quarter of a colonial city the authors picture of this phase of australian life u especially deserving of commendation life as she here depicts it is actually being lived in singlestoried weatherboard villas in all the poorer suburbs of melbourne and sydney it is a less squalid life perhaps than that led by equally needy people in england because it is somewhat less cramped and confined but it is squalid petty and unlovely the heroine is a commonplace character enough though not unpleasing while she is little more than a child her vanity and simplicity combined with her unusual prettiness mark her out as a victim of the unoriginal wiles of a handsome blackguard who boasts that he has royal blood in his veins the girls downfall is a stereotyped piece of fiction but as a young mother she adopts a course which is certainly unusual among heroines and successfully sues her betrayer for breach of promise all this is rather deftly managed and without serious disregard of the probabilities we are enabled to reach the sort of denouement which the majority of novelreaders have long ago pronounced to be the most fitting  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed long 6s mks campbell praed clearly gave her imagination a rest when planning her latest story and was content to follow a wellworn track which runs through some rather dreary country here is once more a beautiful innocent girl who rejects an honest mans love and yields to the florid attractions of handsome swaggering alexander stewart betrayed by a mock marriage she meets with the usual experience of scandal and desertion when for her childs sake she demands recognition as a wife the author does not hesitate to provide stewart with a legal wife shut up in a lunatic asylum nuni destiac is dismayed and the reader is sorry for other than sympathetic reasons the only variation upon the old theme is that at mrs stewarts death nuni brings an action for breach of promise the sort of revenge hardly consistent with her character and a departure from the tradition she had closely followed hitherto her numerous predecessors in misfortune were equally ready to die of a broken heart or to marry the patient lover in the background  they would have scorned to appeal to a jury there 13 vigour and individuality in several of the characters and the story is well told but as a whole it falls far below mrs praeds best work the bitterness and hopelessness that become part of the life of the struggling official class in leichardts town are almost too faithfully reflected in these pages it is not the first time that mrs campbell praeds australian stories have made us realise that all the gold of the diggings

poor girl has worn a face full of trouble  and to use the housekeepers words  has fallen into a sad hystericky way lately it seems that she was born and brought up in the village where her father was parish clerk and she was an early playmate and sweetheart of young jack tibbets since she has come to live at the hall however her head has been a little turned being very pretty and naturally genteel she has been much noticed and indulged and being the housekeepers niece she has held an equivocal station between a servant and a companion she has learned something of fashions and notions among the young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis insomuch that her finery at church on sundays has given mortal offence to her former intimates in the village this has occasioned the misrepresentations which have awakened the implacable family pride of dame tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a spice of coquetry in her disposition showed it on one or two occasions to her lover which produced a downright quarrel and jack being very proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back upon her for several successive sundays  the poor girl is full of sorrow and repentance and would fain make up with lier lover  but he feels his security and stands aloof in this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother who is continually reminding him what he owes to his family for this same family pride seems doomed to be the eternal bane ct lovers  as i hate to sec a pretty lace in trouble 1 have felt quite concerned for thc luckless phoebe ever since i heard i er story it is a sad thing to be thwarted rn love at any time but particularly so at this tender season of the year when every living thine even to the very butterfly is sporting with its mate and the green fields and the budding groves and the singing of the birds and the sweet smell of the howers are enough to turn the head of a lovesick girl i am told that the coolness of young readymoney p very heavy at poor phoebes heart instead of singing about the house as formerly she goes about pale and sighing ana is apt to break into tears when her companions arc full of merriment   mrs hannah the vesta gentlewoman  of mv lddv lihycraft ha had long ua alld walks with phoebe up and down the avenue of an evening and has endeavoured to squeeze some of her own verjuice into the others milky nature she speaks with contempt and abhorrence of the whole sex and advises phoebe to despise ail the men as heartily as she does but phoebes loving temper is not to be curdled she has no such thing as hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole composition she has all thc simple fondness of heart of poor weak loving woman and her only thoughts at present are how to conciliate and reclaim her wayward swain 1 the spells and lovecharms which are matters of sport to the other domestics are serious concerns with this lovestricken damsel she is continually trying her fortune in a variety of ways i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six wednesdays and three fridays successively having understood that it was a sovereign charm to ensure being married to ones liking within the year she carriesabout also a lock of her sweethearts hair and a ribbon he once gave her being a mode of producing constancy ina lover she even went so far as to try her fortune by the moon which has always had much to do with loverv dreams and fancies tor this purpose she went out in the night of the full moon knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the od traditional rhvme  i  all hail to thee moon all hail to thee 1 pray thee good moon now show to me the youth who my future husband shall be  when she came back to the house she was faint and pale and went immediately to bed the next morning she told the porters wife that she had seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow which she was sure was young tibbets  at any rate she had dreamed of him all night both of which the old dame assured her were most happy signs it has since turned out that the person in the jneadow was old christy the huntsman who was walking his nightly rounds with the great staghound  so that phoebes faith in the charm is completely shaken 9 a village politician  i am a rogue if i do not think i was designed for the helm of state  i am so full of nimble stiatagems that i should have ordered affairs and carried it against the stream of a faction with as much case as a skipper would laver  against the wind tue goblins  in one of my visits to the village with master simon he proposed that we should stop at the inn which he wished to show nie as a specimen of a real country inn the head quarters of village gossip i had remarked it before in my perambulations about the place it has a deep oldfashioned porch leading into a large hall which serves for taproom and travellersjoom  having a wide tireplace with high backed settles on each side where the wise men of the village gossip over their  e and hold their sessions during the j og v inter evening jhe uudloid i aa i easy indolent fellow shaped a little like one of his own beer barrels and is apt to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on one side n 1 his hands in his pockets whilst his wife and daughter attend to customers his wife however is fully competent to manage the establishment and indeed from long habitude rules over all the frequenters of the taproom as completely as if they were her dependants instead of her patrons not a veteran alebibher but pays homage to her having no doubt been often in her arrears i have already hinted that she is on very good terms with readymoney jack he was a sweetheart of hers in early life and has always countenanced the tavern on her account indeed he is quite the  cock of the walk at the taproom  as we approached the inn we heard some one talking with great voiubilityand distinguishing the ominous words  taxes  poors rates and  agricultural distress it proved to be a thin loquacious fellow who had penned the landlord up in one corner of the porch with his hands in his pockets as usual listening with an air of the most vacant acquiescence  the sight seemed to have a curious effect on master simon as he squeezed my arni and altering his course sheered wide of the porch as though he had not any idea of entering this evident evasion induced me to notice the orator more particularly he was meagre but active in his make with a long pale bilious face  a black beard so illshaven as to bloody his shirtcollar a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at the sides into a most pragmatical shape he had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction of mine host  at sight of master simon the landlord was evidently a little flurried and began to rub his hands edge away from his corner and make several profound publican bows while the orator took no other notice of my companion than to talk rather louder than before and with as i thought something of an air of defiance master simon however as i have before said sheered off from the porch and passed on pressing my arm within his and whispering as we got by in a tone of awe and horror  thats a radical he reads cobbelt  1 endeavoured to get a more particular account of him from my companion but he seemed unwilling even to talk about him answering only in general terms that he was  a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded trick of talking and was apt to bother one about the national debt and such nonsense9 from which 1 suspected that master simon had been rendered wary of him bv some accidental   rn encounter on the held of argument for these radicals are continually roving about in quest of wordy warfare and never so happy as when they can tilt a gentleman logician out of his addle  on subsequent inquiry my tupiciou have been cooirmed i find the radical has but recently found his way ioto the village where he threatens to commit fearful devastations with his doctrines he has already made two or taree complete converts or new lights he shake tiie faith of several others and hnartevously puzzled the brains of many of the oldest villagers who had never thought about politics or scarce any thing else during their whole lives  he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness of mind and body worrying about with newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has shocked several of the staunchest villagers by talk ing lightly of the squire and his family and hinting that it would be better the park should be cut up into small farms and kitchengardens or feed good mutton instead of worthless deer  he is a great thorn in the side of the squire who is sadly afraid that he will introduce politics into the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking community he is a still greater grievance to master simon who has hitherto been abie to sway the political opinions of the place without much cost of learning or logic but has been very much puzzled of late to weed out the doubts and heresies already sown by this champion of reform indeed the latter has taken complete command at the taproom ofthe tavern not so much because he has convinced as because he has outtalked all the old established oracles the apothecary with all his philosophy was as nought before him he has convinced and converted the landlord at least a dozen times who however is liable to be convinced and converted the other way by the next person with whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king master simon and the squire she now and thea comes out upon the reformer with all the fierceness of a catomouutain and does not spare her own softheaded husband for listening to what she terms such  lowlived politics what makes the good woman the more violent is the perfect coolness with which the radical listens ta her attacks drawing his face up into a provoking supercilious smile and when she has talked herself out of breath quietly asking her for a taste of her houicbreej the only person that is in any way a match for this redoubtable politician is readymoney jack tibbet who maintains his stand in the taproom in defiance of the radical and all his works jack is one of the most loyal men in the country without being able to reason about the matter he has that admirable quality for a tough arguer also that he never knows when he is beat he has half a dozen old maxims which he advances on all occasions and though his antagonist mav overturn them never so often yet he alwav brings them anew to the ricld he is like the robber in ariosto who though his head might be cut off half a hundred times yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling and returned as sound a man as ever to the charge whatever does not square with jacks simple and obvious creed he sets down for  french politics for notwithstanding the peace he cannot be persuaded that the french are not still laying plots to ruin the nation and to get hold of the bank of england the radical attempted to overwhelm him one day by a long passage from a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes in newspapers in reply he gave him one ofthe stanzas which he has by heart from his favourite and indeed only author old tusser and which he calls hisgolden rules  leave princes affairs undcscauted on and tend to such doings as stand thee upon  fear god and offend not the king nor his laws and keep thyself out ofthe magistrates claws when tibbets had pronounced this wilh great emphasis he pulled out a well lilied leathern purse took out a handful of gold and silver paid his score at the bar with great punctuality returned his money piece by piece into his purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned up  and then giving his cudgel a stout thump upon the tloor and bidding the radical  good morning sir  with the tone of a man who conceives he has completely done for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity out of the house two or three of jacks admirers who were present and had been afraid to take the field themselves looked upon this as a perfect triumph and winked at each other when the radicals back was turned  ay ay said mine host as soon as the radical was out of hearing let old jack alone  ill warrant hell give him his own 1  some of mr irvines sketches are much in the manner of the characters of theophrastus and the microcosmographia of bishop earl  we shall

they please and so on still the whole country or kingdom over theres liberty thc birds of the air can take no morejovial crew since the meeting with the gipsies which 1 have related in a former paper 1 have observed several of them haunting the purlieus of the hall in spite of a positive interdiction of the squire they are part of a gang that has long kept about this neighbourhood to the great annoyance of the farmers whose poultryyards often suffer from their nocturnal invasions  the mention of this work reminds us of a hoax that has been played on some of the morning and country newspapers who have reprinted several of bishop earles characters as co pied from an old ms just discovered and northeast rr hf fore pridedln they are however in some measure patronised by the squire who considers the race as belonging to the good old times  which to confess the private truth seems to have abounded with goodfornothing characters this roving crew is called  starlight toms gang from the name of its chieftain a notorious poacher i have heard repeatedly ofthe misdeeds of this minion ofthe moon for every midnight depredation that takes place in farm or fold or farmyard is laid to his charge starlight tom in fact answers to his name he seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be traced in the morning bv the  mj mi mischief he has done he reminds me of that fearful personage inthenursery rhime  who goes round the house at night  none but bloody tom who steals all the sheep at night  none but one bv one  in shortstarlight tom is the scapegoat ofthe neighbourhood but so cunning and adroit that there is no detecting him old christy and the gamekeeper have watched many a night in hopes of entrapping him and christy often patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose but all in vain it is said that the squire winks hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feeling towards the vagabond because of wu being very expert at all kinds of games a great shot willi the crossbow and the best morrisdancer in the country  the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested about the skirts of his estate on condition that they do not come about the house the approaching wedding however has made a kind of saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension of all sober rule it has produced a great sensation throughout the female part of the household  hot a housemaid but dreams of wedding favours and has a husband running in her head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies  there is a public footpath leading across one part of the park by which they have free ingress and they are continually hovering about the grounds telling the servant girls fortunes or getting smuggled in to the young ladies  i believe the oxonian amuses himself very much by furnishing them with hints in private and bewildering all the weak brains m the house with their wonderful revelations the general certainly was j very much astonished by the communica i tions made to him the other evening by j the gypsy girl he kept a wary silence to j wards us on the subject and alfected to treat it lightly  but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his attentions to lady lillvcraft and her dogs  i have seen also phoebe wilkins thc  housekeepers pretty and lovesick niece holding a long conference with one of these old sybils behind a large tree in the avenue and often looking round to see that she was not observed 1 make no i doubt that she was endeavouring to get some favourable auzurv about the result of her lovequarrel with young ready money as oracles have ahvavs been more consulted on loveaffairs than upon anv thing else i fear however that in thinstance the response was not so ftvoura hie as usual for i perceived poor phoebe returning pensively towards the househer head hangingdown her hat in her hand and the ribbon trailing along the ground  at another time as i turned a corner of a terrace at the bottom of the garden just by a clump of trees and a large stone urn i came upon a bery of the young girls of the family attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was at a loss to comprehend the meaning of their blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation until i saw the red cloak of a gypsy vanishing among the shrubbery a few moments after i caught sight of master simon and the oxonian stealing along one of the walks of the garden chuckling and laughing at their successful waggerv having evidently put the gypsy up to the thing and instructed her what to say  after all there is something strangely pleasing in these tamperings with the future even where we are convinced of the fallacy of the prediction it is singular how willingly the mind will half deceive itself and with what a degree of awe we will listen even to these babblers about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry with these poor vagabonds that seek to deceive us into bright hopes and expectations i have always been something of a castle builder and have found my liveliest pleasures to arise from the illusions which fancy has cast over commonplace realities as i get on in life i find it more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful manner and i should be thankful to any prophet however false that would conjure the clouds which hang over futurity into palaces and all its doubtful regions into fairyland 9 the squire who as i have observed has a private good will towards gipsies has suffered considerable annoyance on their account not that they requite h indulgence with ingratitude for they do not depredate very flagrantly on his estate but because their pilfering and misdeeds occasion loud murmurs in the village 1 can readily understand the old gentlemans humour on this point i have a j great toleration for all kinds of vagrant j sunshiny existence and must confess i  take a pleasure in observing the ways ot j gipsies the english who are accustomed to them from childhood and often suffer from their petty depredations consider them as mere nuisances but i have been very much struck with their peculiarities i like to behold their dear olive complexions their romantic black eves their raven locks their lithe slender n gures and to hear them in low silver tones dealing forth magnificent promjjs of honours and estates of world s ean and ladies love     their mode of life too has sometime iii it very fanciful and picturesque they are the free denizens of nature and maintain a primitive independence in spite of law and gospel of county gaols and country magistrates it is curious to see this obstinate adherence to the wild unsettled habits of savage life transmitted from generation to generation and preserved in the midst of one of he most cultivated populous and systematic countries in the world they are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people about them they seem to be like the indians of america cither above or below tiie ordinary cares ami anxieties of mankind heedless of power of honours of wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations of the times the rise or fail of grain or stock or empires tiiev seem to latish at the toiling fretting world around them and to live according to the philosophy of

B3857	"['8956515', '3171566']"	  the school for saints by john oliver hobbes fisher unwin this fantastic story by john oliver hobbes is absolutely different from the ordinary novel for it has no particular plot and the characters walk in and out in a delightfully inconsequential manner in fact it resembles a succession of brilliant scenes interspersed with reflections rather than a connected story among other things there is a good deal of roman catholic lore introduced robert orange the hero turns roman catholic and he and his friends discuss religion with some fervour but they never become tiresome about it or give the impression that they are preaching at the reader one feels that the conversations are introduced more from the authors exuberant joy in the subject than from any wish to proselytize the book resembles indeed in this characteristic and in the clearness with which the most subordinate characters are defined laurence oliphants 1 altiora peto a book like this one written by a brilliant writer evidently under the obsession of a very strong religious idea but even in the case of such an artistic writer as john oliver hobbes the weakness of introducing a pet subject is curiously illustrated where the subordinate characters are so good by the comparative failure of robert orange the hero and his lady brigit who produce almost all the roman catholic talking and writing they do not seem to live quite in the same way as reckage and his brother lord wight lady fitzreeves and that accomplished scoundrel purflete the hero and heroine are elusive they seem more minds than persons and this coldness and want of directness in their presentation seems due to thef actthatthey are used chiefly for the emission of the authors ideas butas we have hinted the author riots in a wealth of minor characters whose conversation and acts are most amusing and convincing real and imaginary people are mingled in a most eccentric fashion disraeli is introduced by name though it must be confessed he is rather disappointing and an english ambassador to paris is brought in under a very thin disguise and for many of the other characters actuality is suggested by footnotes or parentheses purporting to represent actual events but there is no vulgarity about it and none of them depends for its interest on any likeness fancied or real to actual persons then the plot itself is wild enough to satisfy the fantastic character of the actors we are whirled off from paris to an english byelection and thence to general prim and a carlist rising in spain reigning grand dukes and their agents intrigue mysteriously and purposelessly throughout the proceedings and altogether it is one of the most fascinating olia podrida we have met for some time at the end the author promises to continue the history of mr robert orange and if the second part is half as good as this it will be decidedly welcome  the school for saints a new period in john oliver hobbes literary career begins impressively in  the school for saints she has travelled far since  the gods some mortals and lord wickenham and there was need for that was an ugly story with a nauseating atmosphere and the air in this one is pure even to austerity from the first her habit of smartness has been tempered by an intellectual outlook but here mental energy dominates the book making it a storehouse of suggestive things brilliant things paradoxical things which the reader should by no means pass by breathless for the story for these things make all the worth of the volume intellect conviction a personal vision of life have stamped themselves on the pages but the story the characters hardly ever help and often hinder the effect as a book it is a brilliant chaos as a story it is a complete failure probably the writer had no intention of making a vivid and balanced plot but there is clear evidence she aimed at the achievement of living human portraits orange is a dreary fiasco he is the young ladys hero handsome aristocratic of ancient lineage dignified portentously solemn a model of piety chivalry and the manners of the high world perfectly inhuman and a consummate bore we have met him before in the pages of ouida but there we could laugh at him here we dare not for he is the mouthpiece of the most admirable sayings his creator endows him with her own literary aptitudes his gait and conduct are wearisomely  the school for saints part of the history of the right honourable robert orange mp by john oliver hobbes 6s unwin immaculate and his style in detached passages ascribed to him is delightful the heroine brigit is impossible bred in a convent she yet talks and acts and comports herself at seventeen with the aplomb the eloquence the skill the trained intellect of an unusually experienced woman of fifty that she is the granddaughter of an emperor does not explain this on one occasion we are allowed to see her as the child she must have been  oh take me away from these people they are stronger than i am and they frighten me i feel my weakness while i am with them i try to look bold and clever but my heart always trembles and i know that in the end no matter how well i fight i must lose the day i am like a small bird on a battlefield  here for once the young fluttering girl is near us then disraeli is a mere shadow so are the carlists hercy is quite unnecessary the fairly well conceived characters are the dull whig reckagebut how much better would he have been in trollopes hands and penste fitzreeves the sentimental kindhearted little fool who is cleverly suggested and who by a triumph of christian feeling is hardly ever made fun of english politics the carlist agitation and the strong refuge of the catholic church are the matters chosen to be welded there is a description of an election but the picture of the fight is blurred the escape from prims soldiers is hardly more vivid there is an enormous amount of undigested catholicity including a long description of the boxa mors ceremony introduced apparently because disraeli was once present but whether he slept or scoffed or was reverential we do not learn the obiker dida on politics on society and human nature are all stimulating all excellently expressed the catholic attitude to life is ably and brilliantly expounded these things are the reason for the books being the incidents are detached tawdry in arrangement never inevitable hardly visualised john oliver hobbes is always original and her latest book demands that you should skip the story and feed on

B7323	['8935177']	  the worka of john m synge 4 vols dublin maunsel  co the publication of these volumes is an event of great importance and the fact that they appear without that preface by mr w b yeats which we had been led to expect throws a grave responsibility upon critics the poet who could have explained finely and faithfully the art and purpose of his friend is silent and it remains for reviewers to indicate as best they may the nature of synges achievement synge saw deeper than others not into the motives but into the significance of men and things that we think is the peculiar quality of his genius he reminds us oddly of gauguin for like that painter he sought amongst simple people to discover the significance of human life and came in his search to feel the mysterious solidarity of the universe he is an epic rather than a lyric poet he goes beyond the expression of particular and definite emotions to give a general sense of continuity and reality he has to make us believe in his vision and this he does by convincing us that his emotions are felt for a world more real than the world that is known to common men it is the  aran islands the third volume of this edition that reveals the dramatists sense of epic this volume is also to be regarded as the reliquary of his narrative style  for the fourtha collection of studies and sketchescontains a good deal of journalism that should never have been reprinted of the tourists and irishscholars who visit these islands few assuredly see what synge saw all that is superficial and quaint and pretty has been brushed away nature he rids of meretricious glamour and sham romance man and the universe confront each other without a single barrier of unreality between them only what is fundamental remains  and that is neither squalor nor brutality but the essential dignity of man and the awfulness of nature if synge is always in touch with the earth he touches it with wings  and surely the earth beneath him is a mountain top the loftiness of the regions to which we are transported is made manifest by a curious accident in describing an interior the author allows himself to use one or two rather commonplace expressions and to compare it with a picture probably he has a millet in mind the intrusion of this note of culture produces the same kind of shock that would be produced by an odious and unexpected piece of vulgarity in an ordinary book the reader is pitched suddenly from a world of impressive reality into that familiar world where worn counters are the current coin of expression and it requires a dozen pages of synges finest prose to lift him back into an atmosphere where prettiness and taste are irrelevant the medium in which the artist expresses his sense of this new world is itself new and superbly adequate it is simple sensuous musical english prose moulded in a celtic mind and spoken by celtic lips we take as an example a passage from  the playboy of the western world which will also serve to introduce another aspect of the authors genius  pegeen providence and mercy spare us all christy its that youd say surely if you seen him and he aftef drinking for weeks rising up in the red dawn or before it maybe and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of may and shying clods against the visage of the stars till hed put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows pegeen  and there was no one in it but the two of you alone  christy the divil a one though hed sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world and not a one of them to this day but would say their seven curses on him and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze maybe in the deadness of the night a man who has penetrated the web of accidents that hides one human being from another will be restless and unsatisfied till he has dived deep beneath the surface of nature and if he be an artist brought up to common light a handful of realities that strange confusion of shapes and colours and sounds and smells had for synge an essential unity also he felt that animate or inanimate all spin together on one planet great is the antagonism between man and man between man and nature greater but between fate and the universe greatest of all at worst men feel this in common they are all in the same rudderless boat at best they can read profound meanings in nature and feel with her subtle sympathies dan in the shadow of the glen turns his wife out of the house  the old vagabond she has sheltered bids her take heart there is a world out of doors let her come and tramp it along with him tramp youll not be getting your death with myself lady of the house and i knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth well be going now im telling you and the time youll be feeling the cold and the frost and the great rain and the sun again and the south wind blowing in the glens youll not be sitting up on a wet ditch the way youre after sitting in this place making yourself old with looking on each day and it passing you by youll be saying one time  its a grand evening by the grace of god and another time its a wild night god help us but itll pass surely youll be saying come along with me now lady of the house and its not my blather youll be hearing only but youll be hearing the herons crying cut over the black lakes and youll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm and its not from the like of them youll be hearing a tale of getting old ttke peggy cavanagh and losing the hair off you and the light of your eyes but its fine songs youll be hearing when the sun goes up and therell be no old fellow wheezing the like of a sick sheep close to your ear the contrast between the smug security of a yeomans cottage and the fine life of the roads and commons is not greater than the contrast between the roads and commons of the fine writer and the motorist and this country discovered by the poets imagination but synge is most profound when he turns his emotional insight upon men and women in great and moving situations as a revelation of the logic of the heart the second act of deirdre is hardly surpassed the story is well known deirdre having overheard a conversation between her lover naisi and fergus emissary of conchubor high king of ulster realizes in a spasm of clear vision what she had never guessed beforethat love is mortal and that her lovers passion great though it be is less pure less simple and less confident than her own he can doubt and love dies she feels that the only thing left to do is to end well what began beautifully to see that nothing fair is spoilt they must go back to king conchubor in his city of emain though there is more than a suspicion of treason and a certainty of sorrow and emptiness no one who reads the play whose mind has been exalted by what has gone before doubts for a moment that deirdre is right though her reasons are not those that cold sense can approve the argument is emotional not intellectual and we feel at every turn that emotion is right it is something greater than instinct or intuition  it is the sure and perfectly lucid perception of a higher truth than can be reached by chopping logic deirdre in a very low voice with the tide in a little while we will be journeying again or it is our own blood maybe will be running away sile turns and clings to him the dawn and evening are a little while the winter and summer pass quickly and what way would you and i naisi have joy for ever   naisi protests that they will stay in safety deirdre theres noplace to stay always its a long time weve had pressing the lips together going up and down resting in our arms naisi waking with the smell of june in the tops of the grasses and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest its a long time weve had but the end has come surely he still protests deirdre shaking her head slowly there are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of samhain  but there is no way to keep life or love with it a short space only its for that theres nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleepingits for that were setting out for emain macha when the tide turns on the sand naisi giving in youre right maybe it should be a poor thing to see great lovers and they sleepy and old deirdre with a more tender intensity were seven years without roughness or growing weary seven years so sweet and shining the gods would be hard set to give us seven days the like of them its for that were going to emain where therell be a rest for ever or a place for forgetting in great crowds and they making a stir synge died before he was forty to assign a class and a division to imaginative artists to register marks and award prizes is the privilege and pleasure of examiners and literary historians it is not for the

B8856	['9429114']	  trevlyn hold or squire trtvlyrcs heir new novels bythe author of  east lynne 3 vols tinsley brotherstrevlyn hold is more interesting and less melodramatio than most of mrs woods later works there is nothing startling about it not even a ghost she has succeeded in working out a good story full of action and plot without the aid of any very gross crime there is not a single murder worthy of the name not a robbery commonly so called not a forgery not a divorce case and only a very mild commonplace trial before a few county magistrates and yet strange to say in spite of this forbearance mrs woods new novel is more exciting than any she has produced since her first success in east lynne this is partly owing to her having refrained for once from imparting to her readers any lessons in teetotalism or political economy so that the story runs its course uninterruptedly and is full of interest from beginning to end another marked improvement in trevlyn hold is that there is more delicacy of touch in the delineation of the characters more light and shade than is usual with this author there aresome good points to be found even in members of the unpopular family and we are led to suppose that some of the persecuted race are liable to occasional failings of temper which render them infinitely more lifelike and true to nature than her heroes usually are mrs wood true to herself however is far from neglecting her favourite theory of retribution villany she believes brings its own reward even in this world innocence is sure to triumph sooner or later whether this is always the case in real life we do not feel so confident but in the world of fiction where the author has an unlimited power of bestowing rewards and punishments it would be hard if the wicked were to go scatbless and if the virtuous failed to obtain their rights at the end of the third volume the story of  squire trevlyns heir is as follows the old squire dies leaving one single daughter and two married daughters to succeed to his estates of his two sons one has run away in early youth and is supposed to have died abroad the other always a delicate invalid has died of consumption also abroad leaving a wife and an infant daughter but the squire never knows for it is fraudulently kept from him that joes widow has given birth to a posthumous son who should of course be heir to trevlyn hold the squire is a passionate vindictive old gentleman and tyrannical withal he is angry with his eldest daughter for having married tom ryle the gentleman farmer and he is angry with his son joe for having married the clergymans daughter and it is not difficult to persuade him to leave his property which is not entailed to the other married daughter mrs james chattaway and her children james chattaway has for years established himself at  the hold as confidential adviser and manager of the estates and by persuading or bribing the unmarried daughter to aid him in keeping the secret mr chattaway succeeds in concealing the birth of joes son and securing the inheritance for himself after his own sons rupert and joseph the squire accordingly bequeaths the hold to his second daughter mrs chattawaythus cutting off all hope for though children of his son joe and of his eldest daughter mrs ryle at the time the story opens james chattaway has been for born years in possession of trevlyn hold and his son cris lords it over his cousins bravely as the young squire should do mrs kyle is bitterly aggrieved that her son trevlyn kyle is deprived of his lawful rights and the neighbours generally regard the chattaways as usurpers and interlopers and feel convinced that rupert trevlyn poor joes orphan boy should be if all had their rights the master of trevlyn hold mr chattaway has received into his family joes children for their widowed mother is also dead and a pleasant life rupert and maud trevlyn have of it there mrs chattaway a weakminded helpless woraau does her best for them but she is as much afraid of her husband as they are and she can do but little to help them maud is made governess to the younger chattaways and rupert is honoured with the office of clerk at some mining works on the estate cris and octave chattaway taking good care meanwhile that they shall not be spoilt by any foolish overindulgence from softhearted mrs chattaway aunt diana tbe unmarried miss trevlyn who also resides at the holl is anxious that no gross injustice or cruelty should be perpetrated and so far as she is concerned administers justice to all her nephews and nieces with an even hand the hero of the tale is george ryle mrs ryles stepson a thoroughly upright conscientious young man who with the most unselfish motives manages trevlyn farm for his stepmother and halfbrother pays off all chittaways unjust claims upon them and is ready to retire in his brothers favour the moment he is required to do so of course george ryle falls in love with maud trevlyn and though persecuted with attentions from octave chattaway never swerves from his allegiance to the oppressed governess and equally of course is handsomely rewarded at last rupert trevlyn is however the bestdeveloped character in the book and in his wrongs and sufferings the interest chiefly centres worn out by a long train of daily insults from his uncle and cousins and stung to madness by a horsewhipping unjustly administered for some trifling offence rupert seizing a burning torch plunges it into a hayrick which stands temptingly close at hand and thereby ruins all his hopes of any mercy from the avaricious chattawaywe will not here relate the end of the story for it would forestall the pleasure of reading the book itself assurance may be given that though cruel chattaways are defeated in the most surprising and unexpected manner and that  the hold  becomes the property of its rightful owner all in good time there are some very welldepicted scenes scattered about the three volumes the accident at the mine and the burning of the ricky ard the death of farmer ryle and the advent of the mysterious stranger with the red umbrella are all excellent some of the characters too are original and well contrasted one with the other gentle mrs chattaway and her strongminded bisters airs ryle and diana trevlyn are good so are nora the bustling housekeeper at the farm and ann canham the weakeyed but worthy charwoman at the lodge take it all in all  trevlyn hold is a successful novel and will be more popular than many of its predecessors though perhaps it is not up to the standard of east lynne which seems to be still the work of this prolific author	northamerica_contra

so one every three months which or something like it seems to be about his present rate of output must bo a heavy strain on the most fertile imagination we seomto see some evidence that it is telling on him not that he writes less carefully than usual but the tendency to disquisition on general subjects seems to be growing on him as if the strain of thinking out his story had to be relieved by a little discursive talkof a kind that comes easily to any practised writeron topics moro or less remotely suggested by his narrative thus we have several pages upon divorce socialism and the  woman question at large one or two about the transmission of letters and the theories it i j might suggest to an inhabitant of mars if  j provided with a glass which would appaj rently enable him to see the letter and not f the vehicle which bore it and a finale upon art and truth on all these subjectsthe first and last at any ratemr crawford writos shrewdly and suggestively but most readers will we think a little resent being stopped in their progress through the story or detained when it is finished in order to hear just then what he has to say another sign of overhaste is a certain lack of organic construction the scene at the opening in which sylvia strahan over a copy of diirers famous  knight and death betrays her heart to though chivalrous elderly colonel who is the hero of the story has little or no bearing on what follows it is not referred  i to again and except as an illustration of a j col wimpoles character serves no purpose 39  in the development of the narrative sudden lj j death too is surely a cheaper mode of ie  solving a dilemma than a writer of mr t j crawfords skill is entitled to use on the je whole the book though readable like everyp thing its author writes strikes us as a trifle  fragmentary  a rose of yesterday by f marion crawford 6s mac millan there is a disappointment in store for admirers of mr crawfords work he gives them in a rose of yesterday  neither glowing italian romance nor the careful detailed study of roman or new york society evidently he has written his new book with a serious purposethat of warning us against the dangers of facilities of divorce we have no quarrel with that his reflections on the subject are not interesting mr crawford is not a thinker nor even an inspiring preacher but as a man with something earnest to say we respect him now to make his sermon effective he should either have made his middleaged heroine divorce her mad and bad husband or convinced us by glimpses at her later life that she never did so as a warning or as a fine example she would equally well serve his purpose but he has not the courage to do one or the other just when the virtuous faithful old lover is trying to persuade her that there she is under no obligation to rejoin her husband who is about to be released from the asylum and when she is resisting but not in a way convincing to the reader mr crawford kills the mad bad husband and the virtuous old lover steps respectably into his shoes  what is the use of his storywhich apart from a moral is not entertaining and which has no moral there is a halfdeveloped boy that interests us a little and an abortive romance of a young girl for an elderly man which does not interest us at all and does not interest mr crawford for he drops it limply and wanders away from it to preach his sermon with the illustration which is no illustration but a shirking of the whole position  new novels i4 rose of yesterday by f marion crawford macmillan  co mr marion crawford is one of the few novelists whom one cannot take for granted other men have their brands and are true to them before we open their books we know what to expect but mr crawford is continually producing a surprise he has now pulled out yet another new stop and in a rose ofyesterday  we are offered sheer ibsenism the rse of yesterday is mrs harmon whom we meet at lucerne travelling with her son archie a halfwitted youth of exceptional strength mrs harmon is the wife of a man who took to drink became brutalise4 illtreated his wife lost his reason and was confined in an asylum enter colonel wimpole the old lover of mrs hprmon he never told his love but she is aware of it and silently returns it they discuss harmon and his possible recovery and the colonel without success urges her to take divorce proceedings this is in the morning and in the afternoon of the same day mrs harmon hears that harmon has recovered and receives from him a letter asking her forgiveness and making plans for the restoration of their home life her struggle over the reply to this request is the kernal of the book she cables the word  forgiven and then for the first time learns from archie a true account of his relations with his father in this scene mr crawford reminds one not a little of ghosts and the total effect producedd is very similar to that left by ibsen archie who is but a child in intellect is led to tell the story of his fathers cruelty the man had continually hit him with the knob of his stick on the back of the head the narrative proceeds i once when you were off somewhere for two or three days on a visit he came at me with a poker that was the last time i suppose he had been drinking more than usual what happened   asked helen oh well id grown big then and i got sick of it all at once you know he never tried to touch me again after that 1 helen recalled distinctly that very unusual occasion when sbe had been absent for a whole week at the time of a sisters death harmon had seemed ill when she had returned and she remembered noticing a great change in his manner towards the boy only a few months before he had become insane what did you do she asked i hit him i hit him badly a good many times then i put him to bed i knew he wouldnt tell  archie smiled slowly at the recollection of beating his father and looked down at his fist helen felt as though she were going mad herself it was all horribly unnaturalthe fathers cruel brutality to his afflicted son the sons ferocious vengefance upon his father when he had got his strength i you see continued archie  i knew exactly how many times he had hit me altogether and i gave all the hits back at once that was fair anyhow heien could not remember that he had ever professed to be sure of an exact number from memory  h ow could you know just how many times  she spoke faintly and stopped half sick   blocks answered archie  i dropped a little blot of ink on one of my blocks every time he bit me i used to count the ones that had blots on them every morning when they all had one blot each i began on the other side till i got round agin some had blots on several sides at last i ont know how many there were now but it was all right for i used to count them every morning and remember all day there must have been forty or fifty i suppose but i know it was all right i didnt want to be unfair and i hit him slowly and counted oh his eyes brightened suddenly ive got the blocks here ill go and get them and we can count them together then youll know exactly  archie unpacked the toys in silence and arranged the blocks all on one side in a nest pile while on the other he laid the soldiers and the little cart with the few remaining toys helens eyes became riveted on the bits of wood there were about twenty of them and she could plainly distinguish on them the little round blots which archie had made one for each blow he had received he began to count and helen followed him mechanicall he was very methodical for he knew that he was easily confused when he had counted the blots on each block he put it behind him on the floor before he took another from the pile he finished at last sixtythreeju 1 he checked himself i forgot i wont say  jukes any more i wont there were sixtythree in all mother besides i remember now yes there were sixtythree i remember that it took a long time because i was afraid of not being fair this is gruesome enough and something new from the author of dr claudius  and  mr isaacs  a roman singer  and zoroaster mrs harmon is moved by her sons story to write her husband a long letter in which she offers again to live with him but states that love is impossible another scene with cilonel wimpole follows in which he pleads for her and her frustrated life but she refuses to be diverted from what she believes to be her duty on returning to the hotel they find a telegram announcing harmons death such is mr crawfords theme or all of it that need be told there are two other characters and a parallel story but they are of no importance the object of the book appears to be ethical a contribution to the solution of the problem of duty before desire in his concern to find an answer mr crawford has forgotten that it is the duty of the novelist to put his readers pleasure before philosophy i cannot describe  a rose of yesterday

constrained him to fight to the last such is the real key to this very clever novel it is perhaps the most finished of mr levers as to plot the nominal hero is one f his stock charactersa man of the world who has been everywhere seen and done everything always losing everything and always tumbling on his feet again in some extraordinary manner we cannot take much interest in him he resembles a civilised hawkeye if hewas new he would be very good but we have seen his double too often before however he fills up space uncommonly well and his adventures give opportunity for some capital descriptions and little bits of worldiyadvicejwhich come from no one better than the author of  harry lorrequer a party intrigue to get an octogenarian judge to resign would not seem a very promising basis for a novel which was to appear by instalments in a popular magazine yet few could pass a scene with baron lendrick and not wish to know whether he was ultimately triumphant over courts cabals and an unscrupulous press true there is much to be said for his enemies his incredible vanity tempted attack but the sharpness of his tongueand we not only read about bis wit bnt can enjoy itooa pat down the assailants the reality of his danger makes the contest perilous enough to interest whilst the extreme inferiority of the dogs which would beard the sick lion enlist all sympathy on one side only his generosity prevents his eating them up and though we see their footprints as they come out it is evident they have been sorely mauled varied attainments will always excite more varied if not more powerful envy and as the chief baron is alwaysin his old age at leastacute enough to appear only on his own grounds he could only be reached through the newspapers once indeed the lordlieutenant tried to see what he could do himself he fared as agamemnon would have done in the tent of achilles the host asserted every privilege and he told the story to his son who he used to say had inherited his temper but not his abilities in these words he twice rose to go away but on each occasion i had something to say that induced him to sit down again it was the whole case of ireland we reviewedthat is did i deployed the six millions before him and he took the salute yes sir education religious animosities landtenure drainage emigration secret societies the rebel priest and the intolerant parson even nationality and mendicant insolence all marched past and he took the salute   and now my lord said i  it is the man who tells you these things who has the courage to tell and the ability to display them and it is this man for whose retirement your excellency is so eager that you have actually deigned to make him a visit that he may carry away into the next world perhaps a pleasing memory of this it is this man i say whom you propose to replaceand by what my lord and by whom  will a mere lawyer will any amount of nisi prius craft or precedent give you the qualities you need on that bench or that you need sadly need at this councilboard  go back my lord and tell your colleagues of the cabinet that providence is more merciful than a premier and that the same overruling hand that has sustained me through this trial will uphold me i trust for years to serve my country and save it for some time longer from your blundering legislation that a man of such conceit as this at last falls a prey to some one who knows how to fool him to the top of his bent is a matter of course but there are many excuses for the blindness of sir william the villain of the tale is his own stepson separated from his wife and at issue with his son the old judge must fabricate for himself some kind of domestic lares his good dinners and what all who hear them for the first time admit them to be his good stories will provide him with listeners and flatterers for his evenings but he wants a majordomoa man who will make out his dinnerlist and see that his champagne is iced who can receive sir brook fossbrookes and doctor his horses in fact a primeminister whose head nevertheless is in every sense alwajs at his disposal but dudley sewell the man of forged acceptances and questionable racingbets is not to be governed altogether by even an irish chief baron and a possible peer it is a rich treat to see how he not only carves the judicial meat but rearranges the judicial wardrobe sir william is transformed into a  dandy of fifty who bows with a grace this deception does not last long but it is necessary in an artistic point of view the old man deserves a fall and even his best friends are glad to find he is not infallible meanwhile sir brook who ought to have been his most trusted friend is far away making his fourth or fifth fortune and of course spending it in daydreams before he has got it he comes back in triumph to find sir william as great as ever still demanding his peerage as the price of resignation but sobered by the recollection that he has at last given some ground for the accusation of senility at last he extorts the offerbut from the enemy he outlives the government which denies him justice and is too magnanimous to lend himself to the intrigues of their successors perhaps the incapacity of his heir may have something to do with his refusal and affection tempers pleasantly enough the last exhibition of intellectual conceit mr lever is rather too fond of letting ns know exactly what his characters like for their meals it is not that they are gluttons but we dont go to books of this class for a dietary though we might easily compile one from them the dialogue is sparkling the perpetual flavour of irishisms is not overdone and much as mr lever has written we doubt if he has ever told a less affected or a more wellwrought tale wo dont like the book the less because it appears without any grotesque illustrations like so many of the novels which are published by messrs blackwood and sons it is got up beautifully and will take a handsome place in any library long after thc first gloss is worn off by the thorough perusal its merits will ensure  sir brook fossbrookke there was a controversy some years ago between two wellknown periodicals upon the subject of lord lyttons novels one declaring its preference for his earlier the other for his later works however this may be there can be no doubt that mr levers productions are susceptible of a similar dispute for whilst they are all more or less based upon a similar plan of fiction their diction their colouring their construction have undergone from the first a gradual but marked modification this even to a careless observer was sufficiently apparent in  tony butler and in the story now before us it will be found confirmed  sir brook fossbrooke  we conceive to be one of the best of mr levers productions we cannot characterise it better than by the word clever it is essentially a clever novel moreover it exactly conforms to the true idea of the romance it supplies us with the precise entertainment that is expected to be found in fiction it is interesting and it is amusing excitement is offered without the violation of probability and it is eloquent without labour or artifice it is wholly destitute of those narratives of practical jokes and that eagerness to excite merriment which so retard the action of his earlier novels though the scene of the story is almost wholly laid in ireland the author has ver sensibly omitted all the hackneyed expletives of the conventional hibernian interlocutor there is only one  faix  in the book and what little irish there is supposed to be is so englished as to pass almost unnoticed dr lendrick a mild and amiable but nervous man the discarded son from matrimonial reasons of chief baron sir william lendrick of the court of exchequer resides with his son and daughterlucy and tomin a pleasant little spot near the river shannon thither one day attracted by the rumour of the excellent fishing to be had in the neighbourhood come sir brook fossbrooke and young trafford a subaltern in hms th casually meeting tom lendrick they are invited to his fathers house the swans nest and there he introduces them to his sister lucy the description given of sir brook fossbroope is excellent an old man who has combatted life in a multitude of shapes whose early years have been devoted to dissipation and who in his riper age yields himself up to abstract contemplations and scientific inquiries sir brook no sooner casts his eye upon lucy than he feels himself insensibly attracted towards her a resemblance to some cherished object in the past awakens in him a paternal affection and it may be said that from that moment he becomes the firm and faithful friend of the two young people nor is the impression made by lucy upon trafford less acute though with him it assumes a nature more romantic prior to his visit dr lendrick makes a journey to dublin to see his father who has been suddenly seized with a severe indispositiona fact that leads his warmhearted medical attendant dr beattie to believe a favourable moment has arrived to reconcile the father and son we are then introduced to sir william lendrick the chief barod an octogenarnan and an insufferable egotist this portrait is elaborate and apparently laboured but it is coloured with great discrimination sir william lendrick claims a larger share of attention than is perhaps neces  he s indeed the przninent character of the book e spargnul of the b with a lat repueo sir brook fabrook by chals lver londoa m d ad willim lokmwoo as as a lawyer envied flattered and caressed by men in all ranks of life his happiness is however far from complete badtempered himself he has had the misfortune to ally himself in second marriage with a woman of a nature the most acid and intractable and domestic turmoils having at last become too frequent to be longer endured this happy couple finally agree to separate nevertheless the wife occasionally honours the husband with a call and these encounters are generally marked with the profoundest courtesy on one side and the most eccentric politeness on the other the interview between the father and son results in this the old man requests him to allow lucy to live with him at his residence  the priory and further adds that he has the gift of an inspectorship of hospitals abroad which he offers to dr lendrick and which after some hesitation is accepted lucy takes up her abode with her grandfather and tom and sir brook fossbrooke both equally poor lay their heads together to devise some method of amassing a fortune the following will afford some idea of the ingenuity of their speculations the colloquy occurs between tom and his father prior to the departure of the latter from his country dr lendrick asks tom his schemes for the futurei we have got several sir the difficulty is the choice sir brook was at one time very full of buying a great tract in donegal and stock ing it with all sorts of wild animals we began with deer antelopes and chamois and last night we got to wolves bears and tigers we were to have a most commodious shootingbox and invite parties to come and sport who instead of going to bohemia the rocky mountain and to africa would find all their savagery near home and pay us splendidly for the privilege there are some difficulties in the plan it is true our beasts might not be easy to keep within bounds the jaguar might make an excursion into the marketplace the bear might eat a butcher sir brook besides doubts if ferne could be preserved under the game laws he has sent a case to brewster for his opinion dont tell me of such absurdities said lendry trying to repress his quiet laugh  i want you to speak y and seriously i assure you sir we have the whole details of this on pap even to the cost of the beasts and the pensions to the widows of the keepers that may be devoured another plan that we had and it looked plausible enough too was to take oat a patent for a wonderful medical antidote as sir brook says there is nothing like a patent medicine to make a man rich and by good l1ck he i posd of the materialfor one he has the secret for curing the bite of the rattlesnake he got it from a tusoarora indian who i believe was a sort of fatherinlaw to him three applications of this to the wound have never been known to fail  but we are not infested with rattlesnakes tom  thats true sir we thought of that and decided that we should alter the prospectus of our company and we have called it the antidote to an evil of stupendous magnitude and daily recurrence a new method of flotation in water by inflating the cellular membrane to produce buoyancy a translation of the historical plays of shaktespe into tonga for the

great smelting furnaoes paole of subtilized metal are carried away to the amount of to d n sterling not merely is the quantity great but the quality as m be inferred is of the most valuable and precious kind to arrest and precipitate this waste is his project and he has been for years g experiments to this end he has at lth he believes a  the long soughtfor problem and as he pose a ieaduin

with much contentment though without much rot meanwhile colonel sewell the son of iady latrick by her 1ls marriage returns with his wife and two children from india these are the evil genii of the book the are admirably sketched but intensely repulsive characters colonel sewenl is an accomplished swindler of the worst type he fleeces or attem to fleece everybody he meets he is shown to us as a thidf aa forger and there is no crime that he is not capable of o mg or at least that his despicable cowardice would him to commit he treats his wife rather worse than a dog and a endures his

whisk evan hermktuwas au om whidk no du mwz u the captivation of her beauty became perfect and it seemed as though each and all these appropriated that radiant beauty to himself and felt his heart bound with a sort of ecstasy yet this is the woman who is maltreated by her husband in the most atrocious manner once flogging her with his horsewhip once turning her out of the house in the dead of night and for ever muttering in her ear with white lips and trembling whisper words of cruel import yet whatever sympathy for her position her sex may compel from us we cannot help the edge being blunted by the despicable character that is disguised beneath an immaculate exterior  nor can we easily deny that all that she gets she very richly deserves however much we may detest the unmanly heart that dictates the chastisement this lady comes to the priory where she strikes up an intimacy with lucy lendrick who however does not entirely reciprocate her apparently friendly attention old sir william lendrick contemplates her with much satisfactionas much for her beauty as for the ease and gaiety of her manners subsequently the colonel ingratiates himself in the household and by much show of humility and assumption of profound respect for the judges wisdom succeeds in rendering himself endurable nevertheless the old man from certain motives fully disclosed before long significantly hints the departure of the gallant colonel and on the strength of this his mother lady lendrick rents the  swans nest  for him where in company with his wife and children he proceeds to ensconce himself he collects round him here through the medium of dinnerparties and brandy and water a number of officers whom he endeavours to swindle but to one of whom he is unfortunate enough to lose a thousand pounds this occurrence is described with great power and the unexpected presence of his wife who watches the players from the back of her husbands chair renders the whole scene singularly effective it is not our intention to enter into any further analysis of the plot believing that we have already said enough to disclose to the reader the nature of the volumes that await his perusal it is of a somewhat complex nature though uniform and consistent indeed strength is the chief characteristic of the story the interest is unflagging the incidents with which the narrative is enlivened being disposed with the nicest discrimiia ion one error however though on the right side which will be sufficiently obvious to an attentive reader we cannot pass over without comment the dialogues are almost all too brilliant from the epigrammatic point and polish with which they are contrived we miss the flow and ease of spontaneous conversation in such men as sir brook fossbrooke and the chief baron this might be thought reasonable but to make girls or men of mediocre intellect converse with the precision and point of matured elocutionists is to violate nature the dialogues in fact seem too laboured the declamation of each speaker is too sententious the conversation seems dictated by the author of  rasselas and however admirable it may be as containing specimens of a just bty le or as a record of profound observation it could have been wished for the sake of accuracy that the language of the women bad something more of sprightliness and ease and of the men something less of artificial point as a fault apart from the artistic quality of the book may be mentioned a grievous solecism in taste which we regret mr lever should have fallen into baron lendrick is a portrait so thinly disguised that every irishman will recognise it at once while a doctor in the novel is positively identified by name this is not a legitimate course for a novelist anid mr lever is clever enough to interest an audience without wounding the feelings of a family	northamerica_contra

direction of them which ensures bira so large a portion of fashionable favour in conformity willi what we then observed we learn that the appearance of these tales has been anxiously looked for in the wellbrea circles to whom after all that is ever the most welcome which sails smoothly on the current of their predominant associations without startling them by any fatiguing originality of thought or offending them wit the inttusiou of a sentiment which can disturb the selfcoinplacency wbioh is their elysium in the article to which we allude we not only endeavoured to show that mr washington irving was essentially a writer of this class but that the curiosity is enhanced anti the approbation more pointed in consequence of so complete a conversion to the tone of the best company of an american republicanif in sinking the sentiment mr i has not also given up the name composition from an angloamerican exhibiting no small portion of the grace and aineuky of the addisonian school in point of expression and that without the occasional annoyance of a sentiment half so bold as even addisons whiggisrn is a curiosity in the world of fashion  not to mention thc insinuating properties of a studied attention to all the estnhlislied notions of the individuals composing it with respect to themselves the adoptions pf their selflove and what they  think they think in relation to a

very  pleasant story of the  stout gentleman in bracebridge hall they j are related as if told at the hunting dinner of a gentlemanly although foxhunting bachelor of a baronet by the different guests and are  rather incidents or isolated adventures than tales bearing out our general observation that the leading faculty of mr irving is a light and pleasant power of combining reminiscences for of positive inven  tion there is scarcely an iota indeed cur author exhibits a little j consciousness on this score for in his address to the reader he  calls very apprehensively for indulgence therefore although several j of these tales are pleasant in themselves there is scarcely one of them which is not traceable in its elements if not in its concoc  tion the adventure of my uncle for instance is in character and locality a loan from the introduction to quentin durward  the german student is an avowed piece of borrowing and if we recollect aright the only thing not borrowed is a sneer at german mysticism and the destructive fervour of mind and fluctuation of principle prevalent at the era of the french revolution from the tale entitled the mysterious picture in this collection we expected something forcible in the development but it exceedingly disappoints and to say the truth mr irving is not a man to deal with the whirlwind of passionthose tempests of mind which strip human nature of its surface and discover the primary anatomy of the soul to say nothing of length and importance of mrs ratcliffe who did all that a woman can do in this department mn irving must not pretend to bear up the train by far the best piece in this commencing portion of the storytelling is  the bold dragoon related in the person of an irish captain of cavalry it is airy and pleasant in the extreme although from an author not so entirely on the right sideawe might suspect the purity of its morality tm materiel of the next division which is entitled  buckthome and his wends is

clinker as given by himself to his corps of reviewers it is pleasant in reference to a conversing and a curving partner in the persons of the bookselling firm who give this dinner but we can only say that if the lofty mr murray has told mr irving that he arranges bis guests above and below the salt in the form of a russian noblemans table at which the visitors at the lower end drink inferior wine

first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living novelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a novelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no good puri posethe very thing which she wishes us to think that she has left undone	northamerica_contra

north and southwhich its author has gathered from the columns of a weekly contemporary retouched and extended the author of  mary barton possesses some of an artists best qualities she will be attended to having never as yet written without engaging the readers interest whether he agrees with or dissents from her philosophies her dialogue is naturalher eye for character is keen she enjoys humour obviouslyshe calls out pathos skilfully few things have been met in modern fiction more touching than the fading away of the poor girl to whom margaret hale attaches herself on removing from the south to a manufacturing town in lancashire the poetical methodism of thisgirl111011011101 uncomplaining affectionthe mixture of rudeness and of reverence with which she looks up to the delicatelynurtured lady make up an admirable picture the author of  mary barton  seems bent on doing for lancashire and the lancashire dialect what miss edgeworth did for ireland and scott for the land across the border there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good	northamerica_contra

B7607	"['9443972', '9586879']"	   the literary examer jj babaannanaan reuben medlieott or the coming man brm e savage esq author of  the bmmmit albany  my uncle the curate atlfi1 chapman and hall llm  reuben medlicott is defined by professor chatterton of the gentlemen with whom the readers of tinnier0118 fitable novel will become acquainted as the comis  who never comes full of promise in his youml11 the highest expectations on all sides able to do snvmi which he will only make up his mind he never does i up his mind and tails accordingly his great mturalr enable him to wander at will over the fieldsof human exertit and to erect his house wherever it may please him to select domain that he will make his own he settles down tobum therefore in many places but before he has advanced mill higher than the first story of a house his humour chant and he shifts the development of his energies to other mound a great energy of talk being among reuben s properties thii grows upon him as his energies of action become less and less effective his infirmities increase upon him the quality of his talk deteriorates and the subjects among which his shifting enthusiasm travels become more absurd finally after missing halfadozen times the tide of fortune he falls to pieces stranded on the shore of active life he has always been the comiug man and nothing more the experiences of reuben medlicott form therefore as we hare said a novel very profitable to be read many a clever young reader will be all the better for this vigorous lesson from a practised pen on the necessity under which those lie who would do good to themselves or to society of first finding their true path and of then woiking vigorously forward on it without looking to the right hand or the left the high reputation obtained by the former novels of mr savage will cause the public to sit down with much expectation of a feast before the present volumes every one will know his host and be justified in expecting choice food and good cookery that the food is of the wholesomest we have already shown and that it is well presented we are quite able to testify in the first place however it must be understood tbt reuben medlicolt does not present the usual characteristics of a novel in respect of intricacy of plot breathlessness of interest narrowingness of tyrants and devotedness of brets mr savage divides his work into nine books prefaces each with an argument after the manner of fielding and has indeed constructed his narrative very much more after the humour of fielding who raised novelwriting to the dignity of epic poetry than in accordance with the custom of these later times fielding however never directed all the forces of a work to any one didactic purpose and in that respect mr savage has followed the humour of our modern school that good for everything means good for nothing is the moral chosen by the author of this book and his great care throughout is to enforce it thoroughly by all the resources of his humour wit and knowledge while he is carrying the reader through a series of scenes and working out a group of wellcontrasted characters among the characters of the book dean wyndham is especially to be remembered the hardheaded restless overbearing and ambitious polemic with his ttrlffl7fj generosity his learning and his mixture of wo7  and simplicity of heart is a character of the kind which bespeaks the utmost skill and power in the  depicted it on paper the dean is not one of those abstract ideas of some three or four qualities with which oar storybooks are

indications of it will be found in the succeeding extract which will introduce us also to the parents of reuben and his future wife  tbs dean was indeed the guest of canon old port at the time as mr broad and the vicar supposed the canon was an old bachelor abo had a tolerably good library and kept only toogood a table for between the sedentary habits of the student and the bonvicant he bad generally two fits of the gout in the year while in the intervals be waa ao afflicted with corns that in fact he might be said to pass bia whole life in his elbowchair accordingly being passionately fond of gossip and conversation he was always delighted when a neighbour or old college acquaintance dropped in to dine or spend a few dat with him his greatest friend was wyndham and yet the peso was so troublesome a guest that the canon was generally aa veil pleased when he left his house as when he came to it the dean turned every house he entered topsy turvy but he provoked oldport roost by his unceremonious way of tumbling about his books which kept the canon in a continual fret particularly as the dean never restored a volume to its place so that his friend was continually hobbling after him to keep his library in order one evening while toe dean continued oldport a guest it suddenly occurred to him to pay the medlicotts a visit and accordingly leaving the canon to drink his wine alone the thing of all others least agreeable to him dr wyndham took up his huge goldheaded cane tod strode across the fields to the vicarage he was a man of huge frame and gladiatorial muscle nature seemed to have designed him fer physical as well as polemical conflicts he valued himself indeed on his personal strength as much as upon his prowess in controversy and was particularly proud of his pedestrian powers he had each a pair of legs as hogarth would have given to an irish chairman er wilkie to one of the swarthy demonlike coalwhippers to be seen issuing frora those black arches in the strand which might well be imagined to form the regular communications between london and the aether world the vicar was watering his plants apparently screened from public coservation by a close hedge of beech nearly six feet high which separated his garden from the road when he heard a wellknown roogh stentorian voice call out  medlicott you know no more of gardening than you do of newtons principia ill show you how to water when you think proper to let me in the vicar looked up and beheld the broad pugnacioua face of his wifes father with an immense aquiline note and an acre of wellhaven akin the whole overshadowed by a shovelhat with a particulady intolerant cock peering at him over the hedge which he waa veil able to do without atanding on tiptoe having hospitably welcomed his distinguished relative and visitor he ventured to observe goodhumouredly that he did presume to know something of a garden though he waa an humble vicar and had all his life been ready to receive instruction from any one who was so competent to afford it on moat subject aa the dean aa be spoke he hastened to open a small wicketdoor in the hedge to admit the dignitary who instantly thrust himself in stooping more than waa necessary and observing that it would not have coat five shillings more to have made the door a couple of inchea higher the vicar again meekly smiled and excused the door by observing that there waa not such a tall man as dr wyndham in the pariah of underwood or he believed in the diocese give me the wateringpot cried the doctor without noticing the vicars apology

promise which he lived to redeem poor medlicott had generally a good word to say for the quakers but he rarely ventured to controvert any opinion of dr wyndhams and upon the present occasion he observed a most servile silence some time elapsed before mrs medlicott succeeded in drawing her fathera attention to reuben and to the interesting fact that the very next day was fixed for his departure for school  so you are taking my advice at last you ought to have taken it long ago he cried addressing both parents but looking at neither which was no deviation from his ordinary manners in society he then fell upon the eatables on the table as if hia friend the canon bal given him no dinner talking loudly and volubly on the subject of public schools in the necessary intervals of eating and sometimes during the process relating his own exploits at harrow and further to encourage reuben giving lively and forcible descriptions of the discipline which at that period was in vogue in most english seminaries of any notoriety reubens school days remind us of another point in which this novel is inadmissible mr savage has perfectly succeeded in truly representing the state of mind peculiar to boyhood and youth  at least so far as it concerns the depiction of a boy of cleverness and sensibility the sketch of reuben and of one or two of his schoolfellows up to the age of sixteen or seventeen is elaborate and masterly here are some pictures of reuben at a showy ball given by the barsacs who take care to patronise a select number of mr borough a boys the longexpected evening came at last and reuben found himself transported into the midst of a tumultuous assembly of welldressed people in the gay house of which he had so long desired to penetrate the interior except his schoolfellows he was acquainted with nobody there was nobody to tell him the name of any one which of the company were the barsacs or whether they were present or not he was in their bouse for an hour without knowing more than the man in the moon as the raying is he knew the ball had commenced by hearing the music feeling the floors vibrate and finding himself swayed to and fro occasionally by the movements of the dancers though he could scarcely see them he wondered what had become of winning and paid close attention to the ladies in white dresses among whom alone be expected to find miss blanche barsac so strongly had his grandfathers description of her affected his imagination suddenly his shoulder was tapped behind he turned about and found winning at his elbow  why are you not

borough yonder is dry sherry and stay theres pale sherry actually looking at us asking us with her eyes tou shall honour her with your hand  what is her namer asked reuben in great excitement  blanche replied winning little guessing reubens interest in the answer pale sherry was pale  but at the same time very pretty she was what people commonly called an interesting girl she had soft grey eyes which had a particularly earnest and devoted expression in them when she was talking to you which was very flattering and very fascinating besides she had a nice figure and a demure and composed manner which corresponded admirably with her pale complexion and soft eyes none of the barsac girls were mere girls the eldest was probably twentyseven and there was net more than three er four years difference in standing between the eldest and the youngest jf course it was condescending ef the angelic blanche to dance with a boy of thirteen but he was tall for his age aad she acted her part with perfect goodhumour and goodnature keeping him right in the figure as far as she could and trying te put kan as much at his ease aa possible both were dificult things to do t not onlj was reubens

object to mr thackeray as to a novelist who deals too grudgingly with all that is amiable and elevated  but even into his most discouraging scenessuch for instance as the surprise of becky over her petit soaper with lord steynehe will every now and then throw a touch of strong feeling and human interest now we have met with few writers who scatter their amenities so sparingly as mr savage without commanding de balzacs force or minuteness he has all de balzacs dreariness his story contains a character and exhibits a complete picturebut the person selected is singularly unpleasingand the

in platform oratoryfailure even in the quaker asceticism through which the coming man passes as one phase of his many changes such are the incidents of mr selvages book reuben medlicott has many showy qualities and gracious gifts but he is as unstable as water and as vain as a foolish french beauty of the ancien regime such a hero mr savage may rest assured would never have married the daughter of the quaint old dissenting dame from whom he had his schooling nor is there any one character in the book which may serve as a foil to the hero in right of extraordinary gifts or virtues his mother is foolish his father is a nonentityhis aunt is weak the idol of his schoolboy days marries his grandfatherhis favourite associates a french shoemaker and a sister are not much better than they should be the descriptions are more smart than strongmore diffuse than impressive we select one of the best and most manageable scenes a protestant meeting at chichester all tremendous demonstrations resemble one another very closely an excited knot of noblemen and gentlemen on a platform a tumultuous sea of heads on the floor an agitated bevvy of mothers aunts and sisters in a gallery a little table for reporters a peer in the chair if a peer can be found to fill it but never anything beneath the baronetage on the present occasion the platform was thronged with parsons and squires until it overflowed and every now and then a vicar or a pair of topboots came tumbling down among the smockfrocks who united their shoulders to heave him up again when this disaster befell a man of ordinary dimensions he was reinstated on the platform with no great difficulty  but when it happened to public characters of more than average weight the attempt to replace them sometimes proved as ineffectual as in the case of the celebrated humpty dumpty in the nursery rhyme it was unquestionably a  tremendous demonstration of the lungs of the men of sussex john bull bellowed like a herd of his fourfooted namesakes and the protestant lion roared his best without the slightest respect to the nerves of though ladies bottom would have been greatly scandalised awful resolutions were proposed by peers and seconded by commoners but as to the eloquence it was uniformly stifled by its own applause and perished for ever in the premature raptures of the audience it was proved however beyond a doubt that there were two curtii present ready to jump into any chasm which the british soil might please to open beneath their feet a brutus in buckskin was equally prepared to sacrifice all the private affections to the public welfare  as to sydneys hampdens and russells they appeared that day in a force that reflected undying honour upon the patriotism of englishmen how often popery was flatly negatived with the energy of cromwell himself is not to be told in figures but three orators at least pledged their lives and fortunes to defend the throne and the altar the same number of prophetic voices foretold the sunset of british liberty and thrice three times was it powerfully urged upon thc vast assembly to unite heart and hand in a  strong pull a long pull and a pull altogether in the front of the gallery assigned to the ladies who came to brave the roaring of the lion aforesaid sat mrs medlicott and hannah and mary hopkins their eyes were riveted on the platform but it was not on the chairman they gazed although he was the earl of stromness nor on the vicar for he was lost in the crowd nor on mr pigwidgeon ludicrous figure as he cut for there was no novelty in that you had only to watch the point where the three lines of female vision united to convince yourself that they sought nothing saw nothing thought of nothing during that great day and demonstration but the youngest of thc patriot band he who came to dedicate the firstfruits of his talents and his fame to the service of his creed and his country probably few of the ladies present had been unobservant of reuben from un early period of the day for he was conspicuous not only by his heindsome person but by his dress which could scarcely have been gayer or more elaborate had he been going to be married instead of only going to make a speech his hair artfully divided thone like apollos and flowed on his shoulders almost as wantonly as in his boyhood a bouquet nearly as large as barsacs bloomed in his buttonhole and the virgin whiteness of his gloves typified the maiden eloquence with which ho was about to enchant the world the foppery was not entirely his own  the gloves were due to his mother the flowers had bein insisted on and even arranged on his breast by the young quakeress nor was it amiss that so much care had been bestowed on his toilette for had he been confounded with the parsons nnd the squires his rising would not have commanded the attention that it did and his oratory would probably have been lost like that of the rest in the incessant uproar of the meeting everything however was propitious but perhaps most of all the emphatic and gracious manner in which the earl of stromness a man of the highest courtesy introduced him to the audience as  the son of his respected friend the rev thomas

B4784	['9456054']	  barren honour a tale by the author of guy livingstone 2 vols parker son  bourn the title of this novel is the clue to the lesson which it is intended to inculcate it is generally considered a high crime and misdemeanour against the laws of novel reading to glance at the end of a book till we have fairly and honestly worked our way through the preceding volumes up to the last page without having a notion wnat we shall find there but nevertheless we believe that by bearing in mind the catastrophe upon which the plot is hinged we are not only able to take a more lively and absorbing interest in the story itself but we are also better qualified to appreciate justly and without bias the powers and abilities of the writer in carrying out the design he has in view we do not therefore apologise for quoting here the last words of the author of barren honour  i have attempted he says to sketch roughly what befell a man very weak and erringwho was often sorely triedwho acted ever up to the light that was given him at the cost of bitter selfdenial and selfsacrificewho nevertheless in this life failed to reap the tithe of his reward alan wy verne was strong up to a certain point but he had not faith enough to make him feel always sure that he had done right in defiance of appearances nor principle enough to keep him from repining at results he could neither comfort himself nor others thoroughly he was a chival rous truehearted man but a very imperfect christian he dared not openly rebel against the laws of god but he was too human to accept unhesitatingly the fulfilment of his decrees throughout alans life honour usurped the place where religion ought to have reigned paramount he shrunk from shame when he would perhaps have encountered sin to that one principlesound enough if it had not been the ruling onehe sacrificed love and friendship and revenge and life thus it will appear that the author proposed to himself no very light or pleasant task when he undertook to prove by relating this story what a barren fruitless dreary comfortless and unsatisfactory thing honour becomes when a man has no higher principle of action no more solid basis on which to rest his future hopes sir alan wyverne had but one great object in life the desire to do his duty thoroughly as a gentleman and a man of honourand he did it but his life was a failure the story is an old one but not the less interesting for that sir hubert vavasour is an honest goodnatured reckless country squire with a mortgaged estate an idle son a lovely daughter and last but not least a clever and intriguing wife alan wyverne the squires nephew is not unlike him in character and the two are sincerely attached still more attached however is sir alan to his beautiful cousin helen and though he knows he has already wasted the chief of his substance in riotous living and that lady mildred will certainly  forbid the banns he nevertheless has the temerity to avow his affection to his cousin as well as to her father and ventures to indulge in some hope that it may be possible to arrange satisfactory settlements enabling him eventually to carry off the fair helen as his lawful prize sir hubert is quite aware of all the difficulties in the path but he cannot resist the temptation to make his daughter and his nephew happy so he shakes his bead and consents but owns he has not the moral courage necessary to announce the awful fact to my lady my lady however baffles them all she caresses her daughter playfully reproaches the culprits plan and fairly puzzles her husband by her tacit acquiescence but in her heart she makes a vow that  it shall never be  she thought that such a weddingdress would become her daughter worse than a windingsheet and she will leave no stone unturned to break off the engagement she goes to work warily and with caution and makes alan feel properly grateful to her for her great kindness and consideration she however contrives to persuade him to wait a twelvemonth before fixing the weddingday and she insinuates that her daughter is exacting and absurdlyjealous for the rest she trusts to her usual good fortune and lies in wait for an opportunity to make the most of the little advantages she has already gained on her sons max vavasour return home the tug of war begins in earnest max openly avows his regret at the marriage having been even so far settled he owns he  has no prejudice against wyverne personally for nobody has such weaknesses nowadays but it is a simple question of political expediency max brings his friend lord clydesdale to the dene it is too late now of course to hope any good can come of that but max and his mother understand each other and they have a year before them yet raoul tenth earl of clydesdale was the premier parti of england and a coarse selfish overbearing illlooking young man but it would have been a very proper match for helen and so lady mildred feels naturally aggrieved at the thought of how much had been lost by alans rash and precipitate conduct lord clydesdale moreover no sooner set eyes on helen than he began to think himself an illused man he could have made up his mind to confer on her the title of countess of clydesdale and he did not see what right wyverne had to secure the young lady without even giving him a choice in the matter it was not to be born with patience his friend and toady harding knowles suggests that many things might happen before the fatal twelvemonth is over  sir alan might die you know or miss vavasour come to her senses harding does not object to laying very long odds say 6000 to 50000 that the marriage will never take place the bet ls accepted and booked with looks of wicked crafty significance by knowles who for some trifling reason hates alan and is sadly in want of money from this moment the plot thickens alan is persecuted by letters with a curious cypher engraved on the envelope lady mildred and her daughter receive anonymous letters warning them to inquire into his conduct during his absences from the dene explanations are given and received but somehow they are not quite satisfactory lady mildred pretends to make excuses for him thereby doing his cause a great deal more harm than good helen has seen mrs lenox once and has heard of her often she is hurt and grieved at what she believes to be alans conduct with regard to that dangerous lady but she trusts him still and would conting to trust him till death only lady mildred takes care to prevent that and alan gives up his case as hopeless and retires from the field this is the weak point of the story it is extremely improbable that a man conscious of his own innocence and aware that a trap is likely to be laid for his ruin would voluntarily sacrifice the woman he loves for the sake of the woman who loves him nina lenox is a careless imprudent creature always in trouble either about love or money wyverne does not pretend to care the least about her but he was goodnatured and helped her out of her scrapes and thought her rather a bore than otherwiseyet sooner than betray her confidence to his future wife even in his own justification he quietly breaks off his marriage with helen and makes both her and himself miserable for the rest of their lives this is the great instance of alans preferring honour to every other virtue or even duty helen not caring much what becomes of her after this marries lord clydesdale and hates him though he frees her father from his heavy embarrassments and saves the dene from passing into the hands of the jew who had intended to secure the property for his own thereby earning for himself the eternal gratitude of lady mildred and her son max we will leave the dinodment of the story to unfold itself to its readers at their leisure feeling convinced that with a little judicious skipping of lengthy digressions and superfluous descriptions of character in the first volume they will never rest till they reach the end of the book there is a most exciting description of a fight with some poachers and another of a hunting feat of sir alans which will delight the male readers of barren honour and there can be still less doubt that every lady will sympathise deeply with the sorrows of the countess of clydesdale and be ready to lament the mistaken views of the too scrupulous sir alan who in everything but this overstrained sense of honour is about as perfect and loveable a character as can be met with in any novel of the present day	northamerica_contra

she had had in plentyyouthful peers with slender incomes middleaged commoners solemn wealthy dull    but barbara refused them all she told her aunt that she was playing for a high stake but instead of playing the game out barbara like many girls who would be selfish and worldly if their better natures would permit them ceases to care about the high stake and turns away from the green cloth with a modest prize instead of marrying a rich peer she becomes the wife of frank churchill a journalist on the staff of a daily newspaper who has no connexion whatever with the world in which barbara is accustomed to move franks father was an unsuccessful artist in poverty frank picked up his education at a country school and a german university  and when he falls in love with barbara he is living with his old mother in great adullam street which as scarcely anybody knows is a street lying between grays inn gardeas and mecklenburg square indeed barbara and frank churchill are separated by so wide a bar of social circumstances that mr yates feels it necessary to explain with much care how it was that they were guests in the same country house such a coincidence of highborn beauty and obscure toil is by no means usual but the author accounts for it satisfactorily and manages his story so well that when barbara throws her grand wicked old aunt over and in spite of protests and expostulations becomes the wife of a poor journalist readers do not feel that she is acting otherwise than naturally and in accordance with everyday experience after the wedding comes the honeymoon after that the flood of tears and regrets it is a gloomy hour for barbara when she makes her first entrance into frank churchills house in great adullam street from which humble unattractive dingy dwelling franks mother has retreated in order that the bride may feel herself mistress of her own house she is in harness  but though she begins to work with a good will her pride rebels and the weariness of her days whilst her husband is working away from home is too much for her powers of endurance of course the distance between grays inn road and park lane cuts her off from her old friends  and she is offended by such society as frank can procure for her the pipesmoking artists jealous authors and noisy bohemians who spend their evenings in his study are not persons to her taste  and she is even less pleased by their illdressed wives and chattering daughters other sources of trouble arise barbara and franks mother pull against each other  and through the malice and idleness of lookerson mutual jealousy springs up between husband and wife at last after many outbreaks of temper on the part of barbara and after a trifling display of injustice and violence on franks part the younga wife flies from great adullam street and seeks shelter in the house of a married lady how she is brought to repent this hasty step  how frank learns to judge her more leniently  how grief and the prickings of conscience bring her humbly to his side  how he acknowledging his own misconduct whilst he pardons hers takes her again to his arms  and how she is at last  broken to harness and runs merrily on thinking herself lucky in having fallen into the hands of a skilful and merciful trainerare matters about which the reader must learn from mr yates himself the ending of the tale does not quite please us frank churchill ought not to have obtained that legacy and commissionership in the tintax office  the fitness of things requires that he should by hard work in his own profession have raised himself to prosperity and power and barbara as mistress of a house in russell square ought to have made the discovery that life in mesopotamia may be and in many cases is quite as happy and gracious and refined as lifo in belgravia but our disappointment in this respect does not make us unjust to mr yates an historian must be truthful and as barbaras husband became a great man and a rich one in official circles and as she saw fit to live in a pretty villa on the banks of the thames what can mr yates do but state that such was the case apart from barbaras troubles the story contains much good matter the sketches of the clublife of authors and artists are capital enough has been said of mr yatess cleverness and power  but we have scarcely done justice to the unaffected amiability

literary photographer i w1ve say this rather in praise than in depreciation of the first important wvork which he has ever brought 1efore the public hitherto he has been inainly known as far as literature was concerned as a facile essayist and smnart writer like mnany other authors of his generation he suffered for a time from the supposed necessity of imitating mr dickens nobody call have a

married life is fillyll brougiht to a sense of her folly and lbecomes a devoteld and obedient wife possibly if a lady had lescrilel the samne stor sle would not have been so positive as mr yates that so much of the fault in the quarrel was onl the side of the wife and so little on that of the husband however it is a comfort nowadays to meet with a novel in which all the wome n tare not described as injured innocentstoo good for the men whom they reform by their cxample the interest of the story can scarcely be said to centre in loveaffairs at all three ladies may be called the heroines of the novel but the passages from their lives to which mr yates introduces us have very little to do with courtship frank churchill wins the proud beauty to whom he has lost his heart very early in the tale and without any of those traditional obstacles which are supposed to beset the path of true love miss townsends marriage is of the most prosaic character and poor kate mellon never gets married at all still in this as in most other respects mr yates represents life as it really is at the present day if anybody tries to recall the courtships he can recollect within his own circle he will find that ninetenths of them were eminently straightforward and businesslike arrangements and that the course of love ran as smooth as settlements and housefurnishing would allow in most cases if there is anything of romance at all in peoples lives it comes after and not before marriage nor is there any very direct moral to be drawn from  broken to harness except perhaps that literary men had better not marry fashionable ladies and that when ladies are married they had better make the best of a bad bargain life however very seldom conveys any very direct moral the plot of mr yatess novel is simple enough almost from the beginning the reader can guess what is going to happen at the end and the mere desire of finding out the clue to the mystery on which the story is professedly based will not suffice to induce any but the most inexperienced of novelreaders to go on to the last chapters the real merit of  broken to harness consists in the graphic talent of its sketches rather than in any dramatic power to any one acquainted with london life  broken to harness is a photographic gallery you turn over the pages as you might do those of an album and are surprised to see face after face with which you are acquainted the horsebreakerwho is pure as well as pretty simnel and his brother officials at the tin tax office schrdder the german banker of hebrew extraction scadgers the moneylender harding of the statesman charley beresford dr prater mr slade and many others are all persons more or less known to the public under other lames slow far this system of photographing p people you have met in the pages of a novel is altogether a desirable one me 1o ot pretend to sa y if it is to bo dtone at all it could scarcely be lone with less impleisantness than mr yates has done it snpo in always that truth in dlelineatioll is not to 10 sacrficl to consideration for the ob ject of the portirait we have very little doubt that the author had no idea his own descriptions would be easily recognised  and probably to ninetyninlo readers out of a hundred they will seem nothing more than vivid sketches unfortunately the hundredth reader will say at once  oh this is so and so  and the person or persons described are quite certain to be among this small minority and not to like the description the whole question is ono of taste many of the persons whom mr yates depicts may be regarded as public property and types of a class rather than individualities there are one or two however of the characters in broken to harness to whom the world will certainly assign other names than those given in the novel and whose introduction is we think to be deplored having made this criticism we have very little else to do except to praise mr yatess novel it has for us the wonderful chalm that the men and women talk like living beings and do not indulge in soliloquies on every possible or impossible occasion moreover the author is perfectly free from the affectation so common of late amongst minor writers of representing literary men as a sort of caste apart associating on equal terms with every class of society andoccupying aproudposition notconceded toordinaryprofessional men on the contrary mr  yates appears to us to err if anything in taking too low an estimate of the class to which bo belongs the statesman must have been singularly illiberal in its payments to contributors or else frank churchill must have had an unfortunate talent for choosing his friends amongst the lower class of newspaperwriters if he was obliged to introduce his wife to such a circle as that which is described as having frequented the house in great adullam street meopotamnia the feature which chiefly dietinguishes literature as a profession is that the personal character status habits or mode of life of its members have less direct bearing on success than in any other branch of life nobody cares whether a leader is composed in a palace or an attic written by a sot or by the most respectable of mankind the motives therefore which induce men with a view to success in their pursuits to conform carefully to the ordinary standards of society have less influence with professional newspaperwriters than with others and in consequence if a man is illbred and coarse by nature he perhaps exhibits his defects more offensively if his trade is journalism than if he were a clergyman or a lawyer on the other hand it must fairly be admitted that success in journalism presupposes a good deal of information and a more or less intimate acquaintance with a very great variety of subjects there is no class of men therefore who in virtue of their profession are more likely to take an interest in promiscuous topics of conversation than newspaperwriters and we repeat that frank churchill must have been unlucky in his circle of friends if a clever pretty woman like his wife could find no common ground of interest in their talk and society they were men so we are told who outraged none of the social convenances of life about whose manner or behaviour no direct complaint could be made and often she thought herself somewhat exacting when she would repeat to herself as she wouldoh how often that they were not gentlemen not her style of gentlementhat is to say not the style of inen to whom she had been accustomed whein for instance would a man have dared to address his conversation to any other man in preference to her she being present  when could a man have permitted her to opeti a door or place a chair for herself in that set amongst which she had previously nmoved respect her her lhuslbands friends wouild inolre her resencee saying in reply to a remark from her   look here chturchill alu 1un1derstand this or wrould pre vent her ilnerrupiting

that a main  in churchills position would not lave had acquaintances amonist his fellowcraftsmen as illbrud and stupid as m1r yates describes but it must have been his own fault if he could find no fitter associates for his wife amongst the men with whom he was thrown into daily contact in truth as is the case in most photographic pictures the passing sketches of mr yatess book are better than the elaborate portraits it is difficult by any single extract to givo an idea of the authors power of throwing off a sketch as a specimen let us take the account of mrs harding the wife of the editor of the statesman mnrs 1harding was a tery fair average kind of woman a dowdy little person mrs harding the daughter of a snufly welsh rector who had written a treatise on  aorists and with whom h1arding had read one long vacationa roundfaced oldmaidish little woman classically ibrought up who could construe cicero fluently i and looked upon horace q flaccus i mean as rather as loos personage

buti am reduced to the phraseology of the servants hall to express my meaningthey  kept company together and when george took his degree and started in life as leaderwriter for the morning cracker long since lctiilct lhe thouight the best thing he could do for his comfort was to gto for a run to wales and bring back sophia evans as his wife this lhe did  andl they had lived thoroughly happily ever since mirs iarding believed intensely in the statesmnan read it every day from the title to the printers name knew the name of every contributor and could tell who had done what at a glance lier great pride in going out was to take one of the cards sent to the office and observe the effect it made upon the receiving attendant at operas flowershows or conversazioni she always took care that the tickets for these last were sent to her and her headdress of blackvelvet bows with pearl beads hanging down behind was well to the fore whenever a mummy was unrolled the fossi jawbone of an antediluvian animal was del scanted on or some sallow missionary presented himself at burlington house to be congratu lated by hundreds of dreary people on having escaped uneaten from some place to which he never ought to have gone she herself was fond of having occasionally what she called a social evening this recreation was held on a saturday when there was no work at the statesman office when the principal members of the staff would be bidden and when the condi ments provided would be brownbread and butter rolled into cornets tea and coffee and lemonade while the recreation consisted in contersation amongst men who had met for every night during the past twelve months and in examining photographs of the city of prague the ribald young men at the office spoke of mrs harding as plutarch al name given to her one night when mr slater the dramatic critic asked her what novel she was then reading and she replied  novel sir plutarchs lives  but they all liked her notwithstanding and for her sake and their dear old chiefs did penitential duty at the occasional social evenings in decorum street probably critics may complain that  i broken to harness  gives a cynical view of life it is a book written by a man about town of men anl women in town alnd is not therefore likely to be of the gushing order blut in stray touches which occur every now alnd then arlyates shows a pathos andtendlernes3 of feelinig for which a perusal of his earlier writings would harlyv lead the reader to give him credit the narrator of the account of kate mellons death has the power if he chooses of describing something higher than mere london life eil a  broken to harness mp yates has written a story which is romantic enough to fascinate the ordinary devourer of novels sufficiently sarcastic to please the cynics who generally despise them and fraught with a lesson which may render it acceptable to those who usually object as well to the morality as to the immorality of fiction no one can complain that broken to harness is not interesting and amusing while the scenes in which the breaking process are described are true to nature and bear the impress of earnestness and care the author describes his present story as being virtually his first attempt at characterpainting if his future works fultil the promise of this he will secure for himself a respectable position among the literary artists of the day frank churchill a juan of letters falls desperately in love with and marries barbara lexden a fashionable beauty and  a thorough coquette at heart full of anticipations of happiness he carries her off to his dreary house in  great adullamstreet and expects her to revel there in coinjugal bliss but she utterly fails to realise his daydreams cut off from her early friends destitute of the luxuries to which she had been accustomed obliged to exchange the animation and colour of her old surroundings for the dullness and the prevalent leaden hue of her new home in  mesopotamia she loses her spirits and manifests a tendency to be peevish and disagreeable she is worried by a commonplace motherinlaw plagued by wellmeansing neighbours and thrown into the society of men who talk a jargon she does not understand and who treat her as an inferior being instead of showing her the deference with which she used to be addressed until she begins to wonder how she could have been so mad as to sacrifice her brilliant prospects for the sake of a perpetual view of frank churchill he on the other hand discovering too late that the maiden who fascinated him in the paradise of a perfect country house is little qualified to lead the life of a middleclass matron in a dull london residence gives himself up to a gloomy despondency and looks back with astonishment on the foolish fancies which he entertained before his inarriae at length from trivial causes there springs up so serious a misunderstanding between the husband and the wife that they separate pride and jealousy prompt her to leave him and the same feelings prevent him from seeking her out and bringing her back again to his home their sufferings while they are kept apart are admirably described and the scene in which they at last meet and are reconciled by a common sorrow is the best in the book it is one of the merits of the story that its chief interest is reserved for the end instead of reaching its climax at an earlier period and flagging afterwards there is more strength and more feeling displayed in what is almost the last chapter than anywhere else the two threads of the story intermingle at its close and the various persons who have played their parts in its representation are artistically grouped together before the curttin drops the most original character in the book is certainly kate mellon the  pretty horsebreaker the beautiful young amazon who sets conentionalities at defiance who makes her living by breaking  broken to harness  story of english domestic life by

to her is that she is not as probable being such women mnay possibly exist but we are never likely to meet theni it seenins as if mr yates had taken the character of an ideal specimen of the anonyina

B7236	['9415989']	  peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi

ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath  your neighbour is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutysir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane  it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles  a more touching scene is that between sir charles pomander and mrs vanesir charles is in love with mrs vane  now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband pomander  what madam all alone here as in shropshiremabel for the moment sir pomander  force of habit

scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborn to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy  you would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a frienda friend  he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what

character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have i done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman  would he have chosen the day of my arrivalnot if he knew you were coming was the cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed  said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  my last letter written upon th roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly  read me the passage madam on which you argue1 poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish  i had but my husband and my god in the world cried she  my mother is gone my god have pity on me my husband does not love me there is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition the very clever scene in which mrs woffington imitates mrs bracegirdles acting and leads cibber to believe that the real bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as cibber was concernedwhat mrs woffington who had never seen mrs bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous apology  that this country has yet seen  the thing is impossible for cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last mr vane might have been

seem to be the motive of the story that is told with some power in this volume nora crofts is the daughter of a man who by the carelessness of his city friend was brought to ruin and death her childish instinct for justice sets hor apart to be avenger of his imagined wrongs and with all the force of her precocious nature she sets herself to work towards this end her younger brother is her chosen instrument upon his education and advancement she bends her every thought and his successful career at the university and in his profession of the law realises the first great step towards the

capable but illfeatured young woman of a vengeful nature soured by a series of family misfortunes and bowed down by a weight of disagreeable responsibilities time and prosperity however have a beneficial effect upon nora crofts character though as a heroine she is never attractive gradually she is forced to learn the lesson of tolerance towards the family of the man who was her fathers friend and whom for reasons not wholly valid she persists in regarding as the archenemy of her house and founder of its misfortunes finally trouble of the same sort overtakes the medletts longwaitedfor vengeance is within her grasp but love coming rather late into her life obliges her to forswear her childish vendetta and to pay the sum of forgiveness to its uttermost farthing apart from this one character which if treated with too many heroics is carefully studied the book concerns itself with a peculiarly uninteresting class of people and has no particularly remarkable quality to recommend it  the uttermost farthing by b p neuman 6s black this book more than fulfils the promise of mr neumans earlier work the idea is novel and carefully worked out told briefly the plot is this two men croft crofts and medlett friends only in the conventional sense of the word embark at medletts suggestion upon an unsound speculation medlett sells out in time but ashamed of his want of judgement delays to warn crofts crofts is unmanned by his loss and goes under leaving his children to face the world alone after a desperate struggle they pull through thanks mainly to nora a masterful but fascinating girl at last medlett fails as crofts had failed and is reduced to begging from the children of the man he had ruined it was the moment for which nora with her fierce yearning for vengeance had longed and prayed now at lastbut we had better leave the reader to discover what vengeance nora took such is the story improbable as it seems told in rough outline which mr neumann handles in masterly fashion we wish he could have spared us noras middleaged admirer the episode makes the book a little disjointed and it would have been easy to give her money in some simpler way as a whole the book is excellent nothing could be more convincing than the picture of the moral and mental collapse of john crofts the delineation of nora crofts herself strongwilled embittered by her

recognise the more notable workers in a scantily peopled field in mr nathan haskell doles fairly exhaustive compilation the reader must not expect to find necessarily much new light or new matter it

hitherto been applied to them there is much of interest in the notes essays and reviews by which the anglicised or europeanized verse is accompanied but any analysis of papers mostly printed years ago would be manifestly out of place at the present time and we may content ourselves with congratulating the able compiler on the value of his reproductions and the uses he has made of them if we venture to take exception to the assertion that thanks to the attention bestowed upon his writings by modern european critics  old omar stands clearly outlined before our vision and that  if he should teappear in our day it would be as a leader of modern thought we do so under the impression that notwithstanding all that has been said and conjectured about him we have not yet attained to a full appreciation of his already published writings moreover the notion of his reappearance amongst us as a successful uptodate teacher implies a certain experience of the later world which could hardly be acquired by intuition and which even an omar khayyam could not afford to ignore the section described as  comparative versions of the rubaiyat constitutes fitzgerald a kind of fugleman to the corps of translatorsthat is to say his rendering of the supposed original leads the way and gives as it were the cue to others but as might have been anticipated the position is not maintained fitzgeralds genius was never trammelled by adherence to a rigid text and it soon becomes apparent that each expositor abandoning his imaginative and erratic leader follows out his own method of interpreting the persian manuscript in the order prescribed for this particular set of quatrains come nicolas mccarthy korney whinfield garner bodenstedt and graf von schnell elsewhere we search for and discover with

given to the retrospect of prof cowells labours more especially for republishing that eminent scholars contribution to vol xxx of the calcutta review it is pleasant to recall how favourable and yet well poised is the professors estimate of the author of the rubaiyat as shown in the following extract  we find some excuse for his errors if we remember though state of the world at that time his clear strong sense revolted from the prevailing mysticism where all the earnest spirits of the age found their refuge and his honest independence was equally shocked by the hypocrites who aped their fervour and enthusiasm and at that dark hour of mans history whither out of islam was the thoughtful mohammedan to repair  no missionarys step bringing good tidings had appeared on the mountains of persia  the few christians who might cross his path in his native land would only seem to him idolaterschristianity came before omar only in the form of the first crusade unless oriental chronology is hopelessly misleading in regard to local history this must indeed have been about the period in which omar khayyam flourished and it is probable that the crusaders made their victorious entry into jerusalem under godfrey de bouillon shortly before his death though we have no evidence to affirm that he took the same exalted view of christianity as his religious brother and predecessor albiruni who spoke of its tenets with an admiration quite exceptional in the case of a votary of islam he could for the occasion pray with his fellowmen not only outside the precincts of the mosque but without the aid of a mohammedan spiritual guide his pen thus bears testimony on the subject wanting the rose the thorn well might avail wanting the day i make dark night avail wanting praise prayer and sheikh prescribd by rule i make church bells and christian rite avail and now before closing our brief notice of mr doles compilation we may appropriately take note of some three or four rubaiyat significant of a higherclass omar much has been said of our astronomerpoets freethinking his cynicism his restless allusions to an unalterable destiny but in how few of his stanzas have his warmest admirers or most sympathetic interpreters attempted to bring out an underlying christian spirit which is by no means quite occult or to be sought for only between the lines of his verse surely the two following quatrains taken from whinfields translation possess a sufficient flavour of christianity to acquit their author of any wholesale charge of irreligion or infidelity  whateer thou doest never grieve thy brother nor kindle fumes of wrath his peace to smother dost thou desire to taste eternal bliss vex thine own heart but never vex another  today is thine to spend but not tomorrow  counting on morrows

original and which are excellent enough to go beyond the second edition now published retain fairly the metre and meaning of the persian but translators like doctors disagree and this disagreement is often evident in small things for instance in lines breathing the same spirit as those last quotod we find according to mr garner the mosque the kaba tis a prison cell a chain the chimes that from the steeple swell the rosary the mehrab and the church are like the cross all signs of slavery fell according to mr whinfield the lines are thus rendered in english  pagodas just as mosques are homes ot

anglicised the same number of times by prayer is here a service of worship without relation to imprisonment chains or any outward sign of slavery mr whinfields footnote affirming that the meaning

B7698	['6848974']	  the later years of catherine de medici reviews catherine de medici by edith sichel archibald constable and co this is an eminently readable if not a very valuable book miss sichel frankly admits in her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact and has detected no error in accepted dates she has sought to paint the portrait of catherine de medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny she says  here in paris near the louvre beneath the window whence catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of st bartholomew     or near that other window which looked out upon the fastcrimsoning seine  it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past in fact miss sichels book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts but surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities that the window of the louvre overlooking the seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the st bartholomew massacre considerably postdates that tragic event for the sake of a picture however the most vivid details are sure to be selected and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt and this makes the kind of portraiture which miss sichel practises of small worth to the student and even misleading in certain cases but the method has a value of its own it supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history it gives him more than does the historical novel and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do to the appreciation of which qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable there is a danger however that the colouring of the picture may be overdone that the perspective may be false it is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice men historians often enough fall into the same fault under the influence of political and religious bias but with women it seems impossible to avoid it women are born into the world to love and love always entails hate miss sichel is not far from hating catherine de medici and the age of the renaissance in which she lived she writes  the ligue was the counterpart of catherine we have compared it to the great french revolution but there is this vital difference between the two the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea it was the beginning of an erathe death of catherine closed an epoch with her died the age of the renaissance and with the reign of henry iv there came the dawn of modern timesit was the destiny of catherine de medici to imbibe the poison of either influence that of the reformation and that of the renaissance from the reformation she derived its abusesits degradation of religion into politics its gross polemic materialism the more pernicious for priestly vestments from the renaissance she inhaled its stagnant paganism its cold curiosity its stupid blindness to aught but the senses its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in there are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men it is the death of the ideal of faith in man of faith in anything outside him these were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others history provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but sometimes unconsciously it reveals to us certain moral laws it is a medium for them not a pulpit if any person any age is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality that age is the reign of the last valoisthat person is catherine de medici most if not all of this is fustianlittle better indeed than sheer nonsense in the first place it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras epochs ages and modern times strictly speaking there is no such thing as an era an epoch an age or modern times with every minute that goes by the middle ages for instance are getting further and further away from the middle assumingwhich is of course not the case that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end to tell us that the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning and if miss sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the french revolution she is assuredly mistaken if anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudoclassical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movementa pseudoclassicism which by the way achieved among other things the complete destruction of the art of painting in franceat any rate for the presenta curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received especially as it is highly typical the gross polemic materialism of the reformation the more pernicious for priestly vestments is unfair to a highly complex movement one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison detre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism to accuse the renaissance of stupid blindness to aught but the senses is far too sweeping a charge and indeed a stupid one whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been the christian world owes to the renaissance an immense debt to say that catherine de medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man which he has never been without as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge is to give that good lady who had her commendable points an importance which she never possessed and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft  of the meed of immortality with miss edith sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency history she says provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page which is her last yet although for long men did not know it they were aremaking towards a common goal and using a common watchword that watchword that goal is freedom making f or  moving  is a slang expression but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist  of what use is the historian any way if he is not to be a conscious moralist with history or as much as he can find out about it as his text which is a theological text into the bargain  for the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of good over evil and in that conclusion we are entirely we think in accord with miss edith sichel	northamerica_contra
B9067	['9410645']	  dreamers of the ghetto by i zangwill heinemann mk zangwill is always at his best when he reveals the jews by his patient and sympathetic insight into their ways and by his fearless exposures not only of their greatness but of the more offensive sides of judaism he makes judaismthe judaism which seems to be slowly dying out as the narrow exclusive sect it was intelligible in all its majestic immovability in all its squalid and odious intolerance perhaps no one has ever rendered it so intelligible before sympathetic writers have insisted on the stubbornness of purpose the race and family pride the glorious selfsacrifice for what they hold true which have characterised the jews and their faults have found censorious critics but no one has like mr zangwill fearlessly shown the pathos and the greatness of their squalor and their bigotry and found the secret of their strength even in what renders them most unpopular in christendom ceremony as one of mr zangwills characters here says has been the chief element of their strength another less obvious one which he picks out is the enforced seclusion of the ghetto system which has really only been thoroughly broken down in the present century the bad laws which fastened on them distinctive badges and herded them together in narrow quarters where they saw none but their own coreligionists the insults and persecutions which seemed only to draw them tighter together have all added the strength of martyrdom to their bonds of connexion the removal of these restrictions has already done something to impair the vital unity of the race but not much yet and it remains to be seen if the scepticism and desertions of judaism which are more noticeable now are really anything more than superficial scratches on the system a point which mr zangwill does not notice but which stands out most prominently in his book is the parasitical nature of judaism in the sketch called chad gadya a young venetian jew comes back to venice and makes reflections on the stability of judaism when all the energy and the glory of life which once made venice the great state of the south have departed and he muses on the seeming eternity of judaism when he finds his father living in the palace of some once proud doge or senator that is of course true but he forgets the other point of view that while the proud old venetians gave up all their energy and their wealth to the glorifying of their state the jews a race apart have cared for no country hve made no country great they have flocked where riches were to be found and they have steadily silently selfishly gone on making their private wealth anally to enjoy the half  faded glories in which they had no part the persecutions of the jews are inexcusable but they are explicable from the feeling that all nations have had that they are a race apart who have not the stake in the country which comes from selfsacrifice for it this book is almost entirely concerned with the rebels against ceremony in the jewish foldjews who have been dreamers and have found their souls frozen with the mean ingless jargon and the empty forms which were supposed to make up so much of their livesmen who have tried to burst the bonds but in nearly every case have found themselves either driven back or striving to return to the religion which has guarded them through so many centuries mr zangwill deals with very varied typeswith gay laughterloving heine with the profound philosopher spinoza with the meteor ferdinand lassalle with moses mendelssohn and with sabbatai zevi a messiah who finally turned mohammedan and doorkeeper to the sultan these sketches are not novels they are hardly stories they are as a rule imaginary conversations or isolated incidents in the lives of different people in which their characters stand out translucently a reviewer of mr zangwill said once that he had no human sympathy that his characters do not live there is perhaps a grain of truth in the remark but what would be truer would be to say that all his human sympathy seems merged in judaism as a system he loves it so intensely that though he sees its faults and shows them up he looks on them more as a parent looks on the faults of a favourite child than as a stern critic as he himself justly says in his preface the book is to be looked on as a whole the subject being the old orthodox judaism which all these dreamers play around like flies on a lion as for the sketches themselves the best undoubtedly is that of lassalle the author brings out in a masterly way the stupendous conceit the oriental exuberance of fancy and the marvellous rapidity of execution of this wonderful jew he reminds us much of the glorious and extravagant heroes of disraelis novels or again of harry richmonds father in mr merediths novel heine is good but mr zangwill has fallen into the error which it is difficult to avoid in writing an imaginary conversation of such a wellknown figure he brings in too many allusions to heines own works and employs too many quotations from heine himself consequently the result seems almost too learned to be convincing however it is charming perhaps because there is so much in it of heine himself	northamerica_contra

and will certainly try the nerves of an average reader no doubt the author could quote chapter and verse by way of authority and this part of his narrative reads more like reality than some of the rest dr mac donalds present book is rather disappointing that there are highly poetic passages in it goes without saying yet it jg impossible to rate this volume as among his best it is eerie and mysterious with its strange spectral riders on the dark moor and the deep melancholy that seizes the lonely man with whom the child orba lives and that ever and anon drives him out into the inhospitable night but the mystery is too completely solved and the solution comes too near to the ridiculous the idea of a lady on board a ship is quite enough to set mr clark russell off it does not much matter whether the young woman is eloping or meets her hero for the first time in cabin or on deck he has done the thing before in both ways and as the reading public evidently likes a conjunction of neptune and venus from mr clark russell he will doubtless do it many times again the incidents of the  strange elopement  strike one as more improbable than those of any of the authors previous sea novels and the plot is as thin as thin can be but there is a dash of freshness in the narrative from first to last and it will not come amiss to a healthy appetite for novelreading a book dealing with cowboys and storekeepers rowdy emigrants and strange representatives of a spasmodic order and a frequently purblind justice does not raise high hopes but in the straightforward and vivid narrative which introduces the western hero from colorado to the little city in kansas the reader soon loses his slight repugnance to the theme and rapidly becomes interested in the simple story jeff grant is a very sufficient hero the rough life of the west which has strengthened his nerves and trained his eye has not hardened his heart or disqualified him for a more social existence when after

noteworthy that the same process very liberally applied saves the wretched hara not only from judge lynch but from the slightly more formal operations of regular justice although judge judas cochrane before whom the case was trie 1 had a strong pecuniary interest in his condemnation these methods however by common consent do not detract from though merit of the performance  the man who ll try to cure the wound he gives and stand between the cuss he dropped and a whole township if need be is rarer than a white buffalo there is a contrast between this manly merciful adventurer a gentleman at bottom and the rather supercilious young man from the east his rival in cleos affections but philip improves under reverses and we will hope shakes off some more of his cubbishness in europe whither

peerages of the land and in possession of a splendid fortune has an only son who is of too much importance to be trusted out of sight and is consequently tutored at home and turns out wayward and wilful he marries the only daughter of a french house of still greater antiquity and distinction than his own clandestinely though nobody would have been better pleased with the match than his parents this occurred at the commencement of the french revolution and to get out of the way of impending danger the beverleys remove to rome where in a few weeks the young man is found murdered and on examining his papers his connexion with mademoiselle davrancourt is discovered the lady is understood to be in the family way and to save the scion of their son no time is lost in flying to paris though too late to save the mother the child is miraculously rescued and identified marked on the breast with a bloody hand stamped by the mothers terrors before its birth at the sight of her fiathers

of their title and estate without proofs of legitimate birth  and as to the french property here is one whose interest it is no legitimate heir should appear with villainy enough to dare the worst to prevent it for a time however all goes smoothly the boy apparently the grandfathers successor is educated by the curate of the parish who has a lovely daughter of young arthurs own age and as they grow up naturally fall in love with each other luckily her mother had been of the noblesse and the beverleys now earl and countess of roxmere are liberal and care not for fortune they are willing it

ruffianly fellows and carried in a most tempestuous night on board a boat which after long tossing is capsized and he is thrown back upon the shore apparently lifeless the source of this seizure was of course the treacherous and bloodthirsty frenchman recovering however the youth now sets out a campaigning and in his absence folks are busy at homeespecially a match making dame of quality who has two girls to dispose of to prevent his marriage with the parsons daughter and secure the prize for one of her own she continues to keep up a little interesting correspondence with him and so

to return to the peninsula and making previously a confidant of the duke of york he departs in spite of all remonstrance on the part of the roxmeres who would have had him stay at homne and take to lucy again but his destiny must be run in spain he is taken prisoner and while with the french army he comes in contact with his french enemy who being in favour and power readily gets him into his

success it will not be creditable to the discernment of the reading public miss willocks is the stylist of the emotions she knows the moods and temperaments of both sexes and while we saw this in her first novel  widdicombe that book was after all only the promise of which  the wingless victory  is the fulfilment the story is really simple dealing with primitive persons in unalluring surroundings it is a case of one woman and three men or perhaps two men and a boy for archelaus rouncewell is scarcely old enough to be classified as a man when he falls under the influence of wilmot borlace the eccentric syren whose character dominates the book she has married mainly because she is tired of single life and although the union with the village doctor starts without any love on her side she has an idea that she can make him into a hero what opportunities for heroism he could have found in a dull cornish village it is difficult to say but wilmot is nevertheless disappointed and after a dangerous flirtation with archelaus  takes on  with a roger hannaford and is about to elope with him when conscience aided by the intervention of a disreputable woman johanna saves her and she returns to her husband repentant and ashamed then follows a period of penance for dr borlace has to leave challacombe and he deliberately selects another village where there is a plague of sickness here wilmot works out her salvation and when the end of the book is reached we find that everybody concerned has also come to a haven of rest and satisfaction this is necessarily a very brief sketch of the plot but it will suffice to show that miss willocks depends more upon her own skill in delineating and analysing character than in describing the sensational or the morbid the fact that she has not avoided the conventional happy ending and has yet been successful indicates her genuine strength a writer who can justify the conventional is an artist in words and miss willocks deserves this distinction she can be epigrammatic without being superficial and she can moralise without being prosy her descriptions of scenery are amongst the finest passages in the book even if they fall short of her incisive phrases when dealing with the small hypocrisies of human minds one sentence may be quoted  that summing up the fanatical devotion which we call  a mothers love mrs rouncewell one of the subsidiary characters is made to say every new child a woman gets is like a new patent medicine she always thinks it will do something wonderful for her and it never does miss willocks will be told that she shows the hardy influence but this will be an injustice talent such as hers was not and never could be acquired in any of the readymade schools of fiction it bears the stamp of originality  the wingless victory by m p willcocks john lane miss willcocks has followed up the success of her 4 widdicombe by a westcountry story which abounds in striking studies of character and real observation of human emotions she is bold here and there in her treatment of sex and seems to have been influenced by ibsen but her boldness is justified the two chief characters are introduced to us as a wedded pair the woman has made a manage de convenance or one might say de curiosite while the man is a doctor full of strength and uncouth oddity she is wilful and alluringone of those small dark women who suggest spanish blood the story tells how they won through much trouble to full understanding of the minor characters those who indulge frankly in western dialect are the bestindeed very good the author has certainly produced a notable novel as well as a good story it seems to us somewhat clogged by overelaboration of style and metaphor some of the descriptions of scenery are pretty enough but not really to the point they remind us of the glorious nineties when young men and women ran riot in metaphors and analogies not to speak of fine writing miss willcocks

died in 1656 at the age of seventytwo he was twice married and the tradition has been handed down that some time after the death of his first wife he employed the friendly services of one john alden to pay court in his name to a fair lady who however fell in love with his ambassador and priscilla mullins became the wife of john alden that courtship is the subject of professor longfellows new poem which tells how a brave and passionate campaigner the captaiu of plymouth read julius cmi3ar while his friend the fairhaired scholar and lover hiding the secret of his own heart went forth vainly to plead the cause of miles standish with the puritan maiden priscilla so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand came to an open space and saw the disc of the ocean sailless sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east wind saw the newbuilt house and people at work in a meadow heard as he drew near the door the musical voice of priscilla ainging the hundredth psalm the grand old puritan anthem music that luther sang to the sacred words of the psalmist full of the breath of the lord consoling and comforting many then as he opened the door he beheld the form of the maiden seated beside her wheel and the carded wool like a snowdrift piled at her knee her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle while with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion open wide on her lap lay the wellworn psalmbook of ainsworth printed in amsterdam the words and the music together roughhewn angular notes like stones in the wall of a churchyard darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses such was the book from whose pages she sang the old puritan anthem she the puritan girl in the solitude of the forest making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun beautiful with her beauty and rich with the wealth of her being so he entered the house and the hum of the wheel and the singing suddenly ceased for priscilla aroused by his step on the threshold rose as he entered and gave him her hand in signal of welcome saying  i knew it was you when i heard your step in the passage for i was thinking of you as i sat there singing and spinning awkward and dumb with delight that a thought of him had been migled thus in the ad psalm that came from the heart of the maiden silent before her he stood and gave her the flowers for an answer fidin no words for his thought he remembered that day in the winter after the first great snow when he broke a path from the village reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house and laughed at his snowy locks and gave him a seat by the fireside grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snowstorm had he but spoken then perhaps not in vain had he spoken now it was all too late  the golden moment had vanished so he stood there abashed and gave her the flowers for an answer john alden did his duty by his friend but as he warmed and glowed in his simple and eloquent language quite forgetful of self and full of the praise of his rival archly the maiden smiled and with eyes overruning with laughter said in a tremulous voice  why dont you speak for yourself john  0 here was for the true heart of the puritan youth temptation of satan he plunged into the wood he saw the mayflower at anchor  rocked

stamp the superscription of a poet yet let us own that it is well apted to the purpose of professor longfellow who writes not for the few but for the many and whose power over a vast army of readers lies in the steadiness with which he abides by the level of the weaker wit giving the charm of his own refined taste to commonplace reflection he never ventures upon thought of which the perfect meaning is not obvious to all men of ordinary apprehension he is glad to escape from the intricacies into which he might be led by a too perfect crystallisation of his verse and in a singsong that permits the utmost easiness of expression he can walk at the level of all ordinary thoughts and cares using the homeliest words when it so pleases him and using them with the rae tact of a true poet for the same reason this poem of miles standish like other of professor longfellows works abounds in iteration words or thoughts on which he would have us dwell recur lines are repeated as they were by the old ballad writers who had a rude audience to sing to and took good care not to puzzle them or let them over look in any portion of its course the main thread of their story the rhetorical artifice derives its beauty from the clearness with which it tends to lay open the heanr of any subject to the meanest apprehension it is this poets evident determination never to write what shall be caviare to the multitude all men can feel but few can think all men can assent gladly to what they know to be a truth and there are high truths known of all familiarly and current through the language of the people in a stream of acceptable commonplaces professor longfellow asks for no new effort of thought he takes the good he finds upon the common way and makes its beauty visible if it be a defect in him to possess little of the subtlety that has distinguished the worlds greatest poets we may say that he owes to that defect some part of his great popularity but from the weaker men who have earned popularity by a dexterity in utterance of the best class of commonplaces professor longfellow is widely parted for he truly has the heart of a poet and the fine taste of a scbolar  the

best of our ability we have endeavoured to appreciate him and in that endeavour have taken up as he bids us  with a heart for every fate successive pieces of his we have more than once tried to extricate the plot of  the spanish student to unravel the intention  of the golden legend and to feel satisfied j with the treatment of evangelinebut in all these poems we have constantly felt that we were  not achieving but pursuing and that no reasonable versifier ought to ask his critics or even his readers from time to time to  learn to labour and to wait the burden which the previous sorrows of mr longfellow laid upon us was really as great as we could bear under the addition of the last volume slight though it be the most benevolent reader however well disposed towards sorrow will timi it difficult to acquiesce judging from his poems our conception of mr longfellow for some time has been that he is an invalid poet who is morbidly partial to what has been called  the nightside of nature it is his fantastic pleasure to lie upon a bed of faded roses which are tinged by the illusive light of a very watery moon  within his breast he informs us  there is re no light but the cold light of stars syste lc matically and apparently from poetic principle tl he avoids everything of a cheerful and en it couraging tone listening only for  voices of tithe night for  inuftied drums beating funeral of marches for the footsteps of weak ghosts which co seem doomed to walk the earth and make an tin appearance when summoned for the purposes ob of poetry with more of sorrow than of anger pr these unsubstantial creatures regard the pale afl poetlay their cold hands upon his or lean he upon his cold shoulder or patiently sit to be yo photographed in vacant chairs which his iniagi

bund or lachrymose kind there is in his st immediate fancy either a chapel or a cloister fo  which he employs not for any specific religious ca  office but as an interesting object or motive to ai 1 sentiment hence he has the unusual luxury p 1 of hearing a bell tolling at intervalshe imagines friars chanting  solemn masses singing a  pray for this poor soul and is enabled  to ly suffer and be strong more especially how ai  ever it is  from the cool cisterns of the mid a night air his spirit draws repose at the d i dead hour of night he goes out in the world di  and listens to the chimes or

moonlightenable him to extend this thought  to the length of fifteen stanzas and make up r what we suppose we must call a poem  i if the world of things into which mr i longfellow misleads us is pale and cold c   and ghastly full of ruins of fires and graves   and wrecksor a world of feeble twilight i  where the embracing sunbeams chastely play t  equally dismal is his world of persons the 1  principal tendency of his poems is to make his   characters fall in love  and the issue to actor   and reader is invariable disappointment weak   love and romantic patience are the agents  i  which mr longfellow chiefly employs in this   service for hearts and souls in lamentable    attitudes and under inconceivably painful cir i j cunistances he solicits public emotionfor i a nameless  struggling

of distress of mind and bener diet bellefontaine the poor young ladys father o is in his last stage a sad instance of distress ie both of body and estate why all this wretchn edness should be thought requisite the reader h  at first is at a loss to understand when how it i ever persevering with the poem he begins to ll discover that mr longor to borrow a witty to j and truer name mr  protractedfellow has u  ordained this distress for the sake of a subsc fis quent piece of description or as the vehicle for  ly one or two exceedingly moral speeches the le reader feels that he has been very unworthily ie even allowing that he has been poetically ij practised upon n nor do the exhortations to calmness and resignation which are so plentiful in mr longfellow make us other than lugubrious they are uttered in so melancholy a tone that it is quite impossible for the reader to believe they are meant when the old priest by way of consoling evangeline for the unaccountable conduct of her lover informs the young lady that  affection never is wasted it is quite obvious that his meaning is and the event proves that she should continue to waste her affection which the poor girl like too many of her sex deluded unhappily does that odd youth too whose brow is sad and whose  blue eye beneath are we correct in understanding his eyelid flashes like a falchion from its sheathwho for no apparent reason carries a banner with a strange device utters in a very weak way through a number of stanzas rather bad latin and ultimately is found  lifeless yet serene in the twilight can he be considered by any sensible reader as anything but a very sad and most unfortunate poetical instance   the psalm of life which the heart of an t american young juan is supposed to be capable of repeating to the psalmist cannot with any justice be called an encouraging poem allusions to deith dust the grave muffled drums funeral marches soldiers perishing the dead past burying its dead and shipwrecked mariners are in our opinion images calculated to deter any reader from a desire to make his life in the least sublime and to leave so dismal a world as rapidly as he can never troubling himself as to his footprints in fact mr longfellows admonitions remind us of mr snodgrasss entreaties to his seconds dont call in the police said mr snodgrass  promise me you wont of course not replied mr tupnian dont despair from reading my poems exclaims mr longfellow to his readers  of course not replies the reader it is in its feeble fftoc rather than in its forms or metres that the vice of mr longfellows poetry lies these last are pretty imitations  but never can be mistaken for the original types of tegner goethe heine or chamisso t indeed if we compare the moonlight scenes of s evangeline with the truthful daylight pictures  of the  herman and dorothea or auerbachs  delicious barflissieif we set the golden  legend bv chaniissos poem or with goethes i faustthe building of the ship beside  the lay of the bellthe ballads by those  of heinethe difference between a composition i and an originalbetween reality and fantasy  is painfully evident  mr longfellow is not one of the poets in  whom gods or men can take much pleasure  our principal objection to him is that he is so a unobjectionable a writer his poems do not  stir exalt and strengthen us they only make  men continually passiveand women continually sr resignedwe do not believe in his vapoury  elysium and cannot reduce our imagination to  the level of his earth i not for men however does the american  poet gracefully rise and take down his shal dowy harp from the willows he is especially ir the young ladies poet for them to an old  german or swedish tune he adapts his melody o yet we doubt if even his most enamoured y readers will feel what mr longfellow calls is  the spell of glamour in consequence of the c present performance  evangeline with all ir i its faults was not wanting in a certain underle glow of poetic light  hiawatha to a certain extent might be pronounced poetical and by the aid of music it was possible to acquire a taste even for  a rainy day and one or two of the smaller poems how the author could be so careless of his reputation as to put forth n the greater part of the poetry which makes up fr this last volume we cannot at all understand d sad though it bc to think it has been written w it is sadder to know that it has been published e and must be reviewed w yet mr longfellow in some degree relieves  h us of a disagreeable duty by pleading guilty and a

olympuss shining bastions j  his audacious foot he planted subsequently there occurs to him the fate  of r milton and cervantes  t natures priests and ru1ante i by affliction touched and saddened a very natural question then presents itself j to the poetnamely this what is the use of perseverance in the art of poetry the occupation being laborious and the end in a worldly point of view too

pinions  the poem upon which in our vulturine capacity the author no doubt expects us to poetivorously write is entitled  the courtship of miles standish and displays mr longfellows method of debasing a fine old hero and diluting an historical fact in the hands of a true poet the deeds of that resolute little band which miles standish commanded and out of which grew all that is great and admirable in the american people might form a worthy subject for a drama or an epic the sailing of the mayflower and the lauding of the pilgrim fathers are events surely far greater in results and better capable of being poetized than the sailing of the argo or the wanderings of ulysses all that the genius of mr longfellow can elicit from them is matter for an exceedingly weak and protracted lovestory

afraid of bullets nor shot from the mouth of a   cannon  i but of a thundering no pointblank from the mouth  i of a woman  1 i that i confess im afraid of nor am i ashamed to confess  1  it   now john

he went by saying the captain was busy had no time for such thingssuch things the words grating harshly fell on the ear of priscilla and swift as a flash she made answer  has he no time for such things as you call it before he is married would he be likely to find it or make it after the wedding  that is the way with you men  you dont understand us you cannot the ambassador argues that the captain is of good family and gives his name and address he was a gentleman born could trace his pedigree plainly back to hugh standish of duxbury hall in lancashire england who was the son of ralph

wading through a mass of dialectical gibberish such as many writers of celtic stories would have us believe is the modern speech of irish men and women of the educated classes a thread of romance runs

preserves a rather futile incognito having devastated her london friends and acquaintance in her amusing leaves from a life now carries her raids into the country and especially into the  island  of purbeck wiith which she has been connected for half a century judging from the impressions produced by her revelations of london life we can easily believe that she  must have been as she admits  a regular dispensation to the place  mr stephen gwynn in his latest book describes himself and his fellow nationalist members as  militant insects we fancy he means white corpuscleswho perform a useful if annoying mission in destroying noxious political bacilli the author of fresh leavess evidently played a similar part in the quiet sleepy old world into which like a torpedo she plunged on her marriage i hit out right and left and made as much mischief and so many enemiesfor which i did not care one jotthat i can only compare those first years to the time spent by a wounded animal in a trap she  swore and declared  that she would not submit to the dictation of the gounty though profoundly happy in her lifecompanion i do not think any one was ever so miserable in the whole world as i was when i had been married about a couple of years and understood what i had let myself in for as long as i could get about with my husbani and we were left alone things were right enough but when i became a mother my life was one long nightmare the simple fact was that the sudden change from a remarkably vivacious household and all the varieties of london amusements to the deadly quiet of domestic routine in a peculiarly oldfashioned tory and churchy society was like a header into a wintery sea a liberal she  could not away with  the domination of the squires and to her capacious theological tolerationa more graceful way of expressing intolerancethe rule of the church was even worse the beloved old rector notwithstanding she was never fond of parsons of whom  i think the less said the better  and she tels with relish the familiar story of the rector  who used to climb to where he could see the kitchenchimneys of seven small manorhouses smoking on sunday and used to claim his dinner where much smoke promised a lordly feed possibly the clergy might retort that a lady who writes of the second commandment  as the one relating to the observance of the sabbath is hardly a competent authority on matters ecclesiastical but the author has now repented of her rebellion i was too young to know the perfect passion old people have for any association  i could see nothing good in old ways which appeared merely outofdate nuisances to me and above all i was appalled by the manner in which every single thing i did and indeed things which i did not do were discussed gossiped over and talked about till i felt as if i lived under a microscope with the eye of a fiend i should much like to know why we one and all of us learn everything in life just too late to be of the smallest use1 the changing views of experience however have not prevented her from giving an exceedingly piquant yet unmistakably true picture of county and countytown life as it was forty or fifty years ago she writes as she talks we imagine in a clever ramblingillogical way with the weirdest to use her favourite adjective punctuation and amazingly constructed sentences but all her vagaries of style and exaggerations do not spoil her book the picture is depressing because it is all vanished now and the death of a town or the disappearance of a venerated class is at least as pathetic as the death of a man the seven county families including it seems all mr hardys  group of noble dames who  ruled the place all more or less kind if they had their own way where are they now the old estates are let to shooting tenants the old manor houses have become farmers dwellings or schools the old rectories are in the occupation of  casuals  who use them for summer holidays the old squires who used to ride to elections at the head of their wellmounted obsequious tenant farmers are dead and gone and even in the town where there once were a score of families worth visiting  there are only about four people who could by the utmost stretch of courtesy be called gentlefolk the writer it will be perceived is as candid as ever personally i bitterly regret the passing of the old squire true when he was bad he was very very bad as the poet hath it but when he and his were good there goodness was widereaching and the whole countryside was the better for their kindly if autocratic care1 there is in these leaves a sufficientll lurid account of the very very bad squire who in addition to rather rampant habits had some delicate fancies such as keeping his mausoleum warmed ready for his reception and drilling his gamekeepers to carry his coffin with even step so that he should not be jolted on his last journey his conduct however reduced his elderly daughter to the melancholy occupation of  winding all the clocks to mark the passing of the sorrowful hours so that they should never be an instant different from each other as perfect a suggestion of dreary misery as can well be conceived there is another story of the squire on the bars up the chimney to evade an intrusive husband which is more cheerful but the general obliteration of the old ways touches the author deeply and she says truly enough that it is not at all certainly  a good thing to have known a place and people for so many many years as i have done the timespirit has jogged their arms and reminded them that they are now but survivals of a time when a man could do as he liked with his own so as the beautiful silence is broken by gramophones and motorhorns and the exquisite cliffs deformed by obtrusive buildings the manor turns its back on all and the old inhabitants are off if they cannot rule they will abdicate despite the fact that at least a hundred people will be miserable for their departure and another village will be left derelict because the head once gone there is no one to keep things together in the good old wey it is sad to see the death of an era and i doubt if anything will replace the real  county folk who are rapidly ceasing to exist i liked their calm benevolence myself admired their absolute certainty of their superiority to the rest of the world and if i laughed at them their queer garments their hideous furniture and their assumption i should not do so now i should not have done so had i understood them and known how they loved their own people and land tyrants maybe now and then still they tried to do their best and i for one mourn over their rapid passing but the author does not confine her chronicles to the  county she has a vivid picture of the old town life where the furniture was not always hideous and where a svres teaservice  the fellow of which was made for marie antoinette crown derby and worcester dinner china and charles ii silver were not unknown though their value was the life was not intellectualthe women talked of their nurseries their gardens their poultry and their neighbours but quite in a different way from the manner in which they discuss these matters now the children were not examined critically and scientifically tempers were tempers and not nerves heredity had not come into sight gurgling  moderators  with colza oil restricted evening occupations and  saveails were ued for economy of candleends the housewives of that day were actual slaves first to the men of the house and afterwards to their things  which they washed up themselves  not one of the genthmen was ever either c willing or able to join the ladies after dinner t the ladies saw each other home if fine i with pinnedup skirts goloshes on their feet a knitted shawls and clouds tied over their t curls and immense cloaks over au if wet they departed in relays in  the brougham from the bear  for all the world like the ladies of  cranford or  emma indeed the author herself in her garrulity though not in  humility sometimes reminds us of miss bates one had to be denominational in such a society avd we can sympathise  with the newcomer of whom the godly old lady said  if only she were a christian i could love her when she heard that i did not take in the sunday magazines there was another wonderful old lady i was one of twentyone my dear who never was known to sit in an easy chair as indeed none of our grandmothers ever did if they had any selfrespect there was also an ungodly young woman who played ball with her rolledup handkerchief in the family pew but she had soon to be  removed whilst another of the inhabitants had a trick of dropping asafetida down the letterbox of a lady whom she disliked chapel manners were as remarkable as those in the funny old church under the  beloved rector one deacon let down the chandelier with a run and scattered the candles and the congregation to spite his colleague and a wealthy man being justly rebuked for putting a penny in the soupplate came next sunday with a douibte handful of coppers which he smashed down with such energy that the plate was broken and the collection dispersed in all directions to the profit of sundry small boys the book is full of delightful glimpses of manners good and bad but we cannot quote more we can only refer to the spirited account of elections in the old days the night funerals of the great families the custom of telling the masters death to the  charming  bees the manner of curing whoopingcough by a hair from the cross on a donkeys back the customs and privileges of the marblequarrymen on easter monday and the mode of paying bills in kind there was at least one admirable trait of country society in those times there were three subjects which were never discussed in my early days and i cannot but think this silence was a wise thing they were the state of ones purse the state of ones body and the state of ones soul it was a sound rule and so wve

thc majority of english readers even those who have travelled abroad and lived in paris are lut imperfectly acquainted with the old court life of france they know something but little of the names of certain kings they know nothing or what is popularly called next to nothing of the people who surrounded those kings and who were often less puppets than movers and impellers of the sovereign such courtlife details present themselves to most readers as the scenes of a new drama on a subject if not entirely novel yet strange and attractive to an audience wearied with authors and actors who year after year go on thrashing the same modicum of chaff in such dramas as this court life there is great splendour com bined with much variety mrs elliots history is not strictly  history she makes her characters speak aa she imagines they would be likely to speak and we must say that mrs elliots imaginative powers are considerable she indulges in such writing as we find in sensation novels and allows us to witness a very liberal quantity of caressing and kissing which we dare say took place as described or ought to have taken place and so is artistically put in but when  stopping her mouth with kisses  is in the foreground of these courtlife incidents hardened as we are our modesty gets somewhat alarmed and wonders with trembling as to what the next stage direction may lead us to infer mrs elliots volumes begin with francis the first and close with louis the fourteenth the former king has always appeared to us as a fortunate ruffian who has had honour far beyond his deserts except valour of a certain sort he had not a single virtue and what would a man be without  the manly heart courage 1 louis the fourteenth was more of a gentleman in his vices than francis the valour of the grand monarque however was not of such a heroic nature as flatterers have proclaimed it to be louis southeast plaint de sa grandeur qui lattache aa rivage was not meant for satire but nothing more sarcastic was ever uttered it might have been said by a courtfool instead of by a courtly poet like boileau there is if the word be permitted a  rascalry  about most of the fine gentlemen who figure in the old court life francis the first could praise the virtue which he could not prize  her soul is as a rose without a thorn he said of his wife claude whom he killed by his brutal indifference mrs elliot truly says of the position of diana de poictiers mistress of the king and next of his son that nothing can more mark the freedom of the times than this liaison and she speaks of diana as being  one of the brightest ornaments of the court the royal mistress was in truth as beautiful a piece of shabbiness as ever lived but morals were in a very confused state francis who after his capture at pavia said or is suppose to have said all is lost except honour stooped to tell a lie in order to get free and according to mrs elliot his sister marguerite prompted the chivalrous monarch to that unchivalrous act when mary stuart appears upon the scene there is a sense of a pleasant change but mrs elliot might have made more of her that hapless queen never looks so bright as when saying smart things against catherine de medicis the marquis de bouilli has noted some of them in his  history of the dukes of guise mary took especial delight in expressing her contempt for catherine as belonging to a family that had been in trade perhaps mrs elliot has been afraid to say of marguerite de navarre all that was to be said and indeed it would make the hair stand on end to read it  she lives in a world of intrigue is a mild form of speech by which to describe one side of the life of this orthodox and erotic lady while to say that  she pendulates between henri de guise and le molle and a thousand other flirtations is a form indicating a certain regularity in a life which was altogether irregular we confess to little or no admiration for most of these people we do not feel any remarkable reverence for that vert galant henri quatre nor do we acquiesce in mrs elliots judgement as to the feminine tenderness of henris mistress gabrielle destrees the mother of henris son the duke of vendome in succeeding chapters the romance of history is not so well told as the history without the romance in the count de st aulaires  histoire de la fronde and when we come to the period of louis the fourteenth we hardly know which are the worse the showy swaggering men or the audacious shameless women lauzun was the typical frenchman of a long period there are a few exceptionally good individuals who occasionally turn up in the moving crowds at the court of louis the fourteenth and ono la valliere who like the young augustine thought pleasure should come before repentance a scene between the lady and louis the fourteenth will give the reader au idea of what we may call the subdued lovestyle of the writer in which she calls in the imagination of her readers to endorse her own   pressed by the king to grant him some mark of her favour la valliere becomes so confused she cannot reply louis grows more and more pressing interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit in the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder again bursts forth and poor louise overcome at once by fear love and remorse swoons away the king naturally receives the precious burden in his arms he seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his attendants in order to obtain assistance ever and anon he stops in the openings of the forest to admire her as she lies calm and lovely in repose her long eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheeks her halfclosed lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth i leave my readers to imagine if louis did not imprint a few kisses on the fainting beauty ho bears so carefully in his arms and if now and then he did not press her beloved form closer to his breast if in this he did take advantage of thc situation chance bad afforded him he must be forgiven  he was young and he was deeply in love words cannot describe the surprise felt by la valliere on recovering to find herself alone born along in the kings arms in the midst of a lonely forest history does not however record that she died of terror or that she even screamed  but perhaps and indeed doubtless she would have done so had not the respectful behaviour of the king reassured her  old court life in france old court life in france by frances elliot chapman and hall historical romance is the handmaid of history even when history has emancipated itself from the level details of the old chroniclers and lives for us in the pages of a macaulay or a froude with something of the passions and changing interests of real humanity there yet remains a place for the historical romance history i3 by profession at least impartial its backward gaze is too comprehensive to allow minute portraiture its aims are too lofty to admit of any but the widest sympathy the nation or the individual as he contributes to the national life is the historians theme in his true function he is a methodioal accountant taking stock of the past who omits nothing balances the errors of one man against the failings of another the greatness of one state against the ambition of another adds nothing to and takes nothing from the facts and figures that lie before him and finally presents the world with his estimate of results in however perfect a manner this operation be performed it is evident that there is yet room for the historical romance rightly composed the romance clothes its heroes with no more living and personal interest than they possessed ra the flesh  but it contrives by a due subordination of details an artful grouping of the principal figures and a light as of the natural heavens thrown on the picture from above to make the whole world appear subservient to that particular spot in space where the little drama enacts itself if the rom ancewriter is a poet so much the better shakespeare though he drew from no other source than dry old hollingshed has filled the story of the plantagenets as far as he told it with life and energy  calling to his aid the fluellens the bardolphs and the falstaffs he made the reigns of our plantagenets something more than landmarks of english history if we had one sterling writer of national romances with genius enough to raise him above the level track of history and yet no coiner of mere fancy with an alloy of fact we should perhaps be greater as a nation in proportion as we saw in the light of today the greatness and littleness of the past mrs elliot does not write historical romance in this way she occupies an intermediate place between the romancer and the historian she presents history in what margaret of newcastle would have called a  romancical dress her method lacks the continuity and completeness of dumas but it allows of greater accuracy and a closer study of character useless details are avoided the material is scanty and at times almost crude  but irrelevant matters are suppressed and those on which must hinge our conceptions of the mans character are thrust sedulously to the front it must be confessed that to interest the reader on such a plan is an arduous attempt it would have been easy to fill in the story with a few legitimate and even historical incidents but mrs elliot has it seems feared to mar the general effect by redundancy  she has avoided the full narrative style of miss freer for instance and elaborated instead a series of animated scenes which in word gesture dress and attitude are intended to be the counterpart of history that mrs elliott has failed sometimes to present in due relief the historical personages who serve as subjects for her nice pen is not to be wondered at that she has succeeded so well as she has is a matter of congratulation one danger we may safely say she has entirely escaped her chapters though often short and fuller of matter than of words are never tediously epigrammatic though it is impossible in this style of work that the artist should be lost in the picture you are not called away too often to admire her artistic qualities the first eight chapters of old court life in france are devoted to francis i his two queens first claude and then elinor of spain one blameless layfigure succeeding another appear the necessary appanages of a court diane de poitier and anne duchesse detampes are the true queens of the hour mistresses not only of the king but in some small degree of the destinies of france the dynasty of mistresses is however scarcely inaugurated in the time of francis the first marguerite de valois and constable bourbon complete the picture in this first essay however mrs elliot is by no means at her best the second group fuller of dramatic incidents offers greater facilities for success catherine de medici the mother of three worthless kings the organiser of the squadron of court beauties the inventor of the sidesaddle forms the central figure from the time fatherinlaw francis  romped with her the entire evening after her arrival to the day when half a century later she lay on her deathbed while the due de guise was murdered overhead this was that due de guise whom the second marguerite de valois would have married but that her mothers ruthless will gave her to the bearnois henry of navarre most of those men whose fortunes and destinies were mingled with catherines during her halfcentury of power and in whom dumas found a neverending source of mystery and intrigue cross mrs elliots stage she has treated them and everything that concerns catherine with much dramatic power and we are inclined to think that this series contains the best written of her sketches as a specimen of vivid description take this of the familiar party of three mother and two sons watching the st bartholomew massacre from a closet over the gate of the louvre to them enter navarre and conde heretics but royal ones who have escaped partly by favour but as it appears mainly by chance charles had recovered his nerves he now looks on huguenots as game and has been potting them with remarkable precision from the window with hideous mirth he boasts to navarre and conde how many heretics he has brought down with his own hand he counts upon his fingers the names of the huguenot chiefs already slaughtered he yells with fiendish laughter when he describes how coligni whom the night before he had called  father looked when dead  by the light of god it is a royal chase  shrieks

already the scenes which unfold the life of henri iv are scantier than we could wish and the episode of gabrielle destrees occupies rather too many of them undoubtedly the most important figure in her  show of kings henri iv deserves a larger space than mrs elliot has allotted to him quitting henri iv mrs elliot comes to the times of richelieu mazarin and anne of austria annes husband the bilious and melancholy louis xih surnamed  the just is summoned to live again his miserable unkingly career in her pages and we then drop suddenly upon louis xiv inaugurating his reign with the ruin of la valliere we cannot however attempt to follow le grand monarque whose court life occupies the latter half of mrs elliots second volume the sketches grow more voluminous towards the close  the last of them is called  the end and from it we make the following quotation  then the dying monarch turned his face towards madame de maintenon who was seated within the ruelle of the bed 41 madame he said in

of the opinion that much is to be learned from the extravagant licence and splendid vices that ruled te court of france mrs elliot has confined her story within courtly bounds and offends no one by the plainness of her speech but after all an intrigue is an intrigue whether the parties to it are kings and duchesses or grooms and servingwomen  and we venture to doubt the ultimate use of such a book as mrs elliot has produced with this reservation we confess to a keen appreciation of the artistic merits ot  ula uourt late in trance hp  oli court life in france this is the fifth edition of a book that has had many readers and many critics it is the kind of book that is especially annoying to scientific students of history who are both jealous and scornful of narratives treated without tootnotes and without much visible aid from documentary evidence unless they are labelled  imaginative literature mere scraps of history in picturesque setting lay figures with historic names affixed and made to play the part which some contemporary gossip has assigned to them are to their mind frivolous and from an educational point of view dangerous the critics are wrong we should never think of going to such books for exact information on every page of this one for instance we feel how the materials have been cooked the scantiest knowledge of history is enough to make us often read characters and motives differently but it does give the popular idea and picture of the personages and events described from a long study of contemporary memoirs from long familiarity with the country the authoress has learned the fitting stage properties has noted the gossip and the anecdotes she has used all her gathered materials not with imaginative power but with the skill and swiftness of the scene painter and scene shifter the result is a nondescript kind of thing neither history nor romance but it is very readable it is a very vivid series of pictures we are given of the princes and lords and ladies of gay old france from francis and marguerite of valois and diane de poitiers down to the last days of the grand monarque when court gaiety died out under the heavy influence of the maintenon and the troubled dawn of a new world the plates from miss pardoes  memoirs of the french court have been reproduced in these volumes which are reissued in a very attractive

robert elsmere  and marcella  for being sugarcoated pamphlets and when she struck out on a quite new path in bessie cotterell in which there was no pamphlet we said that she was attempting work that did not become her now she returns to the earlier model her new story being in fact a sequel to is marcella well at least we cannot ask her to go back to the bessie cotterell  type for that in her hands failed for want of artistic sincerity and her reversion to the kind of thing that first brought her fame means that she has tendencies likings aptitudes that she cannot be criticised out of we ought to be more reasonable now and we are but perhaps the merits of sir george tressady  have something to do with it it is the story of a rather likeable rather colourless man of brains and nar row sympathies who spoilt his political career because marcella exerted such an influence over him that he voted against his party and even his convictions marcella was a goddess to him and he had married a little thin natured shallow vixen of a wife he behaves with great propriety so does marcella so does marcellas husband they all do except lady tressady but propriety does not keep off tragedy and what with his amusingly reckless and frivolous old mother his embittered wife his poverty the strikes among his workmen his shattered parliamentary career and his hopeless adoration of marcella when a hard and heroic death comes to him it is welcome the parliamentary incidents do not strike us as probable marcella in her mellower years is more distasteful than ever wvith her fawning amiability her air of making eyes at all the world including her husband her child and the eastend seamstresses she is a most unpleasing personalitywith something of the chadband in her for all her indiscretions but the book though a dull book is the work of a woman of intellect and of unusually strong sympathies the portraits here are subtler and more living than in her earlier works especially the disagreeable ones like the two lady tressadys and the scenes in the eastend are stamped with sincerity if there was but a little spark of fire anywhere  here is not the temper nor the material out of which great novels can come but in fiction at least we have no abler presentment of the selfconscious earnestness of the time  sir george tressady mrs wards new novel by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co there can be no question that mrs ward is a puzzle to the conscientious critic this has partly resulted from the history of her career as a novelist if we leave miss bretherton out of the reckoning we may say that she seemed to bo sprung upon the reading world with an exaggerated form of that sort of success which somebody has called a sue ces gladstonea rather dangerous preeminence in which if she has a rival it is as his advertisements remind us mr hall caine schoolgirls at once spoke of her with awe and many persons of influence people interested in religious and philanthropic developments whose literary judgement was not necessarily above the level of the schoolgirls on the other hand a section of the illuminati chiefly because she dealt with these religious and social matters legitimate subjects if any were for dramatic treatmentat once set her down for a prig and a pedant and would have no more to do with her all this tends to the confusion of the moderate and modest critic has he to do with a sort of cleansed and refined zola he asks himself or only a more philosophical edna lyall it must make the application of the heavendescended maxim not easy to the distinguished author herself in the present case the critic might well get rid of his difficulties by indiscriminate praise of mrs wards  sir george tressady were such a course fair to any one concerned there is so much that is good throughout and the latter part especially is so fine and moving that faultfinding is disarmed most of the qualities which distinguished  marcella  far above the run of its contemporaries are present again here we have nothing so fully understood and so finely handled as the village life in the previous volumenothing so poetical as the description of hurds poaching or so affecting as the night of hurds execution spent by marcella in the cottage with his wife but the glimpses we get here of the labouring classes their ways and thoughts whether in eastend london or in the mining village in the midlands we should have supposed either north staffordshire or derbyshire from the peoples talk had not mrs ward while giving the characteristic e for a piece  or pleace for placeomitted altogether the equally characteristic ii for e a  for he are well realized and now and then are startlingly effective the english is always choice and in one passage at least the description of sir george tressady awaking in his library after a great quarrel with his wife it reaches a high level the morning air blew upon him and he drew it in with delight how blessed was the sun and the silence of the streets and the dappled sky there to the east beyond the square  after those long hours of mental tension in the crowd and heat of the house of commons what joy what physical relief he caught eagerly at the sensation of bodily pleasure driving away his cares letting the morning freshness recall to him a hundred memoriesthe memories of a traveller who has seen much and loved nature more than man blue surfaces of rippling sea cool steeps among the mountains streams brawling over their stones a thousand combinations of grass and trees and sunand like heralds before the presence these various images flitted passed drew to one side while memory in trembling revealed at last the best she hadan english river flowing through june meadows under a heaven of flame a woman with a child the scents of grass and hawthorn the plashing of water the story of the novel is that of a young man returned after some years of travel and study in our indian and colonial empire full of the revived imperialist if everybody had his due they might fairly be described as the kiplingesque ideas which are such a marked feature in contemporary politics mrs ward is always well up to date in her appreciation of  movements young sir george tressady enters parliament in this spirit and attaches himself to a fourth party led by a certain lord fontenoy whose prototype is not far to seek though it must be said that he only slightly resembles this deceased statesmanwhich is bitterly opposed to the conservative government of the day a rather socialistic body among whom the leading figure is our former friend aldous raeburn now lord maxwell of course therefore mar i celia comes upon the scene in fact she 1 occupies it and is almost as much the heroine of this book as she was of the one  which bears her name at first tressady  is strongly opposed to marcellas way of looking at things and prejudiced against her personally almost at the beginning of the book he marries a certain letty  sewell representative of all that is narrow i minded and vulgar in a privileged class j little as george and his wife have in i common in their natures their views are at 1 the outset the same so far as letty can be said to have any views now comes the change an accidental meeting at a country house leads to a growing friendship between tressady and marcella on her side it never gets beyond the pity of seeing a naturally fine intellect and character cramped and pledged to the wrong cause with him it grows into a passion of devotion of which his wife has good cause to be jealous in this way we have a double motive running through the story  mrs ward almost always has two parallel threadsthe motive of tressadys conversion or halfconversion from the old tory doctrine  power to the capable and strong to a fuller recognition of the hardships and the claims of manual labour and therewith that of his personal conversion to swell the ranks of marcellas devotees it ends in tressadys throwing over his party at a critical division and retiring from politics it also ends in his confessing in a moment of abandonment his romantic love to marcella and as at the same moment letty has gone the length of writing to lord maxwell this modern madame roland is suddenly brought face to face with the fact that she has unwittingly carried disaster into another mans married life very beautifully she humbles herself before the vulgarminded letty tressady and in a great degree repairs the mischief that has been done but sir george is spared the  cursed spite  of being obliged to struggle for ever with the disjointedness of his world he takes part in a rescue down one of his mines and is killed by the falling in of the roof much of all this history is finely conceived and very moving it makes for edification as mrs wards novels always do a great deal of the machinery of the talethe side characters the scenes and dialogues  is admirably contrived and obviously at the expense of great pains and it is an unpleasant task to have to point to the serious drawbacks in the book as a whole what in reality makes mrs ward such a puzzle is that her work is so strangely made up of good and bad the greatest failure in the present case is in the character of marcella marcella boyce seemed a fenuine creation marcella maxwell has egenerated into a schoolgirls heroine a bundle of perfections neither more nor less she is precisely the personage who ought to have been as she was wanting only two steps in the peerage given in marriage to a firstclass earl who kept his carriage of course one will be called a cynic for this assertion but if there be any flaw except of the litterofroseleavesanddinofnightingales order which prevents marcella maxwell being put down as a perfect beauty a perfect wife a perfect mother a perfect philanthropist ana a perfect great lady we do not know where it is to be discovered this is more than a grave it is in a certain sense a fatal error in spite of ben jonson it is precisely the growing like a tree growing invisibly in the thoughts of an author or visibly in his or her writings that makes a character of fiction better or worsethat distinguishes in fact between the created and the manufactured personage of a tale and allows you as no other test does to draw the line between the bestemployed talent and genius think of balzacs people or of thackerays of the grandeur et decadence either of cesar birotteau or of colonel newcome think of ethel or clive of dobbin or hawdon crawley of beatrix esmond baroness bernsteiu this reappearance of marcella therefore is terribly enlightening we frankly confess that the old marcella seemed to us when first we made her acquaintance a complete creation a vital being now looking back and asking ourselves of what she has been stripped to turn her into the superhuman and therefore nonhuman lady maxwell we do not find very much  plenty of opinions but of character not an abundance it is rather we take it as a result than as a cause of this lack of the winged gift of the true creator that mrs ward is able to introduce so much we will not say of teaching but of illustration into her books if her people were more alive they would take the bit between their teeth and refuse to do the things they were wanted to do to illustrate some phase of national tendency or some preconceived theory of the way character developes one might in addition cite a hundred small but speaking instances to prove that our author never forgets her audienceas for example where in the scene of sir georges death she takes care to mention that his message was delivered to letty that passage alone would show that she had not lost herself in her art indeed this whole final scene moving though it is has the air of something written up as if the author had encountered elsewhere a scene conceived on the same lines and said to herself  i can do that too  sir george flvssady by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co in sir george tressady mrs humphry ward has seen fit to test the sincerity of our admiration for the central character of one of her former works by introducing marcella as the dca ex mach ina of her present novel charming though she was on though occasion of our first acquaintance a doubt is born as to whether her reappearance has added anything to our store of pleasant memoriesthe question of sequel in fiction being one not often attended by success several factors combining to render the result as a ride experimental one important reason doubtless is the proverbial fickleness of readers themselves while another may possibly lie in the writers own attitude towards even the most wellconceived and carefully developed personage of the imagination in though interval of presentation a marked change may have taken place in his own interest therein all that was freshest and best having furnished the impulse to the first effort marcella called to do duty again does in a measure redeem our expectation even at times exciting some of the old witchery yet the spark which woke her to life in the story of her youth seems lacking in this record of marcella married and marcella turned politician we view her now from an outside standpoint which admits of coldest criticism she is no longer a wayward noble stumbling lovable girl but is summarised heartlessly and with some emphasis as a political intriguante implying the unscrupulous coquette she may be as earnest as intense as beautiful as loving towards poor humanity as faithfully devoted to her husbands interests as ardent a parliamentarian as the old marcella would have been when developed by her new surroundings but the germ is wanting and only a wellarticulated marionette animated by overmuch pulling remains that sir george tressadys parliamentary upsetting to say nothing of his domestic undoing should indirectly hinge upon this character in whom we have least belief would indicate a fallingoff in the authors further development of marcella it were ungracious to dwell further upon this point when a debt of gratitude remains yet unacknowledged mrs ward having introduced many new and several wellobserved characters in whom thc first interest of the general leader will centre letty especially sir georges wife is brilliantly portrayed showing both skill and delicate insight in though handling whatever her phases and there are many she carnes conviction which is though best perhaps that can be said of any of those who speak and move in the pages of fiction her small ambitions and petty triumphs her little prettinesses the utter inability of her poor soul to rise above the height of her husbands shoestrings her lack of sympathy with all outside the most limited of social belongingsall appear in such light as to prove her reality she embodies the dainty pretty heartless society creature whom everyone knows so well and who is so often illpaired with a sir george of ones acquaintance letty is certainly alive more the pity for wherever she is one may be sure she is bruising the heart of some earnest man sir george himself is interesting wc like him so well that we wish ho had never befooled himself even for the brief moment of his infatuation with marcella every scene with his wifeand those with bin vain prodigal deceitful dying motherbear the stamp of truth thora are no false lines here no rubbing out no substitution no blur all is direct sufficient needful from beginning to end mis ward hits shown her knowledge of the man and grasp of his position the downfall of his ambitions his hampered domestic life with it  fretting money anxieties nnd the undcrcunent of real unhappiness ring true wo realise the soreness of his heart and dwell with him in sympathy of the minor characters there is little reason to speak some are good and some unconvincing but taken as a whole mrs ward has not lost ground by her present work rather does she steadily hold her own among the most important of english novelists using serious means for serious purposes and securing though appreciation of those who understand and are grateful for her undeniable

remarkable of his works they are none the less among the most remarkable novels of recent years this new and carefully revised reissue of his first book reminds one of the deservedlyiine things that were said of it on its first appearance and elf the instant success it achieved with the reading public of a decade or miore ago it is a wonderfully intimate and realistic tale of the uest indies written from the personal acquaintance mr mlacfall made with the place and its people when he held a commission in a wvest indian regimneutand its vzivid minutely faithful pictures of negro character alone make it a book of more than common merit but beyond this it unfolds an excellent story of the life of one negro in particular in all his relations with the men and women of his own colour and of the dominant white race and it works out a great ethical problem fearlessly with humour and pathos and mordant irony mr m1acfalls creed is that though celibacy is nearly as harmful to the race as promiscuity  the main who lives chastely and faithful to his mate is of the elect and the nation that holds his like holds the dominion over the wvorld he enforces this view ably cunningly with a ripe narrative skill and understanding of humanity his psychological study of an average west indian negro is clever and subtle and the powerful story he weaves about him revealing the superstitions the

of sulc as care for good writing in their fiction and are sensi tive to power and truth in the description of the external world it is altogether an exceptional book original interesting and mostly repulsive the repulsion arises from the fact that we are not quite convinced of the accuracy of mr mcfalls presentation of human nature among barbados negroes now and again we have a suspicion that the observation is coloured by the prejudgments of a fix de sick mind that some characters and some situations are tortured to produce a kind of morbid humour and to shake our sentimental ignorance of the negro by any means we may be quite wrong the proper sequel to such a novel is an unimaginative study of the coloured people of the west indies and we hope it may be forthcoming mr mcfalls

starting inspired little good verse in praise of itself these lyrics of pipe and cigar snuff and cigarette are for the most part very trifling affairs good smokers do not talk about tobacco much less rhyme a pipe is poem enough there are of course exceptions such as mr lowell and mr henley and mr leland but in the main it is the enthusiastic but inexperienced young who hymn the weed tobacco makes for reticence for contemplation tobacco is an oriental grave and sedentary silent and content this little book is a piece of western restlessness and frivolity the best thing in it is undoubtedly mr henleys rondeau  if i were king    if i were king my pipe should be premier the skies of time and chance are seldom clear we would inform them all with bland blue weather delight alone would need to shed a tear for dream and deed should war no more together art should aspire yet ugliness be dear beauty the shaft should speed with wit for feather and love sweet love should never fall to sere  if i

radiant should appear if i were king i less well known but not much less excellent is the same poets  inter sodales    over a pipe the angel of conversation loosens with glee the tassels of his purse and in a fine spiritual exaltation hastens a very spendthrift to disburse the coins new minted of imagination an amiable a delicate animation informs our thought and earnest we rehearse the sweet old farce of mutual admiration over a pipe heard in this hours delicious divagation how soft the song the epigram how terse with what a genius for administration we rearrange the rambling universe and map the course of mans regeneration over a pipe both these poems by the way are more than twenty years old mr henley is represented in all by eight pieces seven of which specifically belaud the pipe a meerschaum for preference it is therefore a little odd to find him figuring in the frontispiece with a cigarette between his fingers mr lowell also praised the meerschaum   the pipe came safe and welcome too as anything must be from you  a meerschaum pure twould float as light as she the girls call amphitrite mixture divine of foam and clay from both it stole the best away its foam is such as

immortal form the typo and very venus of a pipe and though meerschaum has othor adherents and eulogists among mr hutchinsons poets on the other hand though late mr r f murrays  ballade of the best

pipes an fancy pipesthings jes made to sell but any pipe that kin be bought for marbles chalk or pelf aint ekal to th haver of th pipe you make yourself the prospect of having to make ones own pipe is too alarming cigars cheroots and cigarettes come in for celebration but in the main the book is the book of though pipe as to brands of tobacco the poets are not explicit mr t b aldrich like the late james payn explains that he is addicted to latakia  but the question is left vague by his brother bards we cannot consider that mr hutchinson has done his work particularly well the number of pieces with no signature to thom or any indication of origin is much too large and considering how easy it is to trace the authorship of verses that appear in reputable newspapers it is a sign of carelessness on mr hutchinsons part that he appends to certain selections only  the globe  the st jamess gazette and so i on though editors of these journals would 1 have f urnished though names of their con1 tributors with pleasure again mr hutchinsons notes are very scant in the other anthologies included in the canterbury poets particularly in the case of the sonnets of the century collected by mr william sharp the general editor of the series the notes have been full and interesting but mr hutchinson has only thirteen to a volume of over two hundred and fifty pages there are cases where notes are positively needed or deserved there is a piece of blank verso by mr leland for example inscribed  to w g h ie mr w g hutchinson which we imagine was written especially for this volume  but mr hutchinson does not say so this is the practical end of it  well take tobaccoany kind you like and keep it in a jar of stone or glass  if iu a bag a bladder makes the best and sprinkle it with old jamaica rum note that the rum should bo extremely good for much depends ou it then you will find it gives peculiar fragrance to the leaf like that of the havanas which we had all in though olden time

been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old

B5028	['8627594']	  the fortunes of glencore by charles lever 3 vols chapman  hall between this novel and its predecessors from the same pen there is a difference as wide as that between a feudal tournament and a tipperary row formerly mr lever was a lord of romantic misrule his harry lorrequer was the kinsman of his irish dragoon and both were the heroes of fun folly and adventure the lever literature in truth was sprightly and rollickingthe action ofthe several stories rattled on amid uproar and excitementthe actors and the audience laughed together there was a brogue even in the style of the narrator the fortunes of glencore is of another stamp it is a serious novel built upon a plan more conventional than that adopted by mr lever in any of his former works from a prefatory notice we quote the authors account of his literary temptations  if i have never disguised from myself the grounds of any humble success i have attained to as a writer of fictionif i have always had before me the fact that to movement and action the stir of incident and a certain lightheartedness and gaiety of temperament more easy to impart to others than to repress in oneself i have owed much if not all of whatever popularity i have enjoyed i have yet felt or fancied that i felt that it would be in the delineation of very different scenes and the portraiture of very different emotions that i should reap what i would reckon as a real success this conviction or impression if you will has become stronger with years and with the knowledge of life  years have imparted and time has but confirmed me in the notion that any skill i possess lies in the detection of character and the unravelment of that tangled skein which makes up human motives he presents glencore not as a proof but as a test of his capacity for drawing social portraits his story he admits may not be particularly interesting as a narrative but it is an attempt at close delineation of character manners and modes of thought as influenced by the civilization of our age in great britain and in italy for although glencore is the name of an irish castle and many of the personages introduced are english a large proportion of the ground surveyed is italian while much of the groupsketching belongs to the danimonde of florence glencore is the name of an ancient castle on the killeries an inlet of the sea in the west of ireland it appertains to a noble family of whom the sixth viscount is the central figure of the story although his son divides the sympathies of the reader when the tale opens lord glencore after a prolonged absence has returned to his ancestral habitation whereisolated penurious and melancholyhe devotes himself to the education of his only son in course of time two old and confidential friends arrive at the castle they find its inmate alternating between delirious fever and a habit of morbid soliloquy the boy is scarcely less eccentric than his lather gradually the secret glimmers out from the reserve and mystery of glencore the viscount all novel readers will have suspected ithas been deserted by his wife mr lever however has managed to develop a novelty in  connexion with this incident glencore unfolds to his confidential associate sir horace upton a plan of revenge upon the lost and faithless lady sir horace alone could offer testimony to the marriage  all the documents are at glencore castlethe viscount destroys these documents sacrifices his son and proclaims that clarissa isabella daughter of sir guy clifford and commonly called lady glencore was never married but is still clarissa isabella clifford ami mother not of a seventh viscount but of a social outcast this shaft of vengeance launched from the killeries reaches florence where the separated wife  la comtesse de glencore reigns queen of beauty and fashion thus stigmatized she disappears glcncores son disappears also the story then winds through numerous intricacies to the end which in fairness tu mr lever we will only vaguely indicate in the last chapter billy traynor the most original character in the novel meditates alone at the ancient castle  the battlements have fallenthe atlantic winds blow noisily through the fractured walls the old man reads the family chronicles  he started up from his reverie and taking his stick issued from the room the mist was beginning to rise and he took his way towards the shore of the lough through the wet and tangled grass it was a long and toilsome walk for one so old as he was hut he went manfully onward and at last reached the little jetty where the boats from the mainland were wont to put in all was cheerless and leadenhued over the wide waste of water a surging swell swept heavily along but not a wiil was to be seen far across the lough he could descry the harbour of leenane where the boats were at anchor and see the lazy smoke as it slowly rose in the thick atmosphere seated on a stone at the waters edge billy watched long ami patiently his eyes turning at times towards the bleak mountain road which for miles was risible at last with a weary sigh he arose and muttering he wont come today turned back again to his lonely home to this hour he lives and waits the coming of glencore racterpainting as mr lever explains in the preface has been his aim throughout these volumes we think his success special though partial billy traynor in spite of occasional exaggerations is a lifelike figure with a lifelike voice the elder glencore typifies in his diseased hate and weary weakness the fortunes of his declining family his son is but a shadow and melts out of view  sir horace upton is a political portrait the original of which perhaps might be discovered without trouble of course mr lever had the princess lieven in his eye when he studied for his lady diplomatist col harcourt full length hangs at the light end of the gallery glencore occupies the gloom there is careful drawing in all these portraits sometimes the features are unreasonably prominent frequently the tintings are those of the toilettetable not of nature mr lever we think is rough in his use of the dissectingknife to the machinery of the story objections more serious may be taken it fe worked partly by means of correspondence occasionally by newspaper paragraphs and in one instance by a leading article there is too much stilllife  though reader continually regrets being led away from the healthy irish landscapes and peasant circles around glencore following the fortunes of the miserable viscount we arrive at a passage which is a fair sample of mr levers dialogue and romance new style and how is the dear duke asked upton sharplyjust as you saw him at the court of louis the eighteenth he swaggers a little more as he gets more feeble about the legs and he shows his teeth when he laughs more decidedly since his last journey to paris devilish clever fellows these modern dentists are he wants to marry i suppose youve heard it not a word of it who is the happy fairthe nina as they call her now she waa one of the della torres who married or didnt marry glencore dont you remember him he was colonel of the eleventh and a devil of a martinet he was i rememler him said upton dryly well he ran off with one of those girls and some say they were married at capri as if it signified what happened ut capri she was a deuced goodlooking girl at the time  a coquette you knowand gleucore was one of those stiff english fellows that think every man is making up to his wife he drank besides no pardon me there you are mistaken i knew him intimately glencore wat as temperate as myself i have it from lowther who used to take him home at night he said glencore never went to bed sober at all events she hated him and detested his miserly habitoanother mistake my dear major glencore was never what is called a rich man but he was always a generous one i suppose youll not deny that he used to thrash her  ay and with a horsewhip too come come scaresby this is really too coarse for mere jestingjest by jove  it was very bitter earnest she told brignolles all about it im not sure she didnt show him the markstake my word for it scaresby said upton dropping his voice to a low but measured tone  this is a base calumny and the duke of brignoues no moro circulated such a story than i did he is a man of honour and utterly incapable of it i can only repeat that i believe it to be perfectly true  said scaresby calmly  nobody here ever doubted the story i cannot say what measure of charity accompanies your zeal for truth in this amiable society scaresby but i can repeat my assertion that thia must be a falsehood  you will find it very hard nevertheless to bring any one over to your opinion retorted the unappeasable major he was a fellow everybody hated proud and supercilious to all and treated his wifes relationswho were of far better blood than himselfas though they were canaille i a loud crash as if of something heavy having fallen here interrupted their colloquy and upton sprang from his seat and hastened into the adjoining room close beside the doorso close that he almost fell over it in entering  lay the figure of lord glencore in his efforts to reach the door he had fainted and there he laya cold clammy sweat covering his livid features and his bloodless bps slightly parted the fortunes of glencore we suspect is mr levers favourite among his own works it is we think clever amusing spiced with telling satire written throughout vigorously and keenly but if we had to decide on though authors claims to a permanent and peculiar reputation we should not accept this book as his highest testimonial he must not omit frorahis titlepage author ofcharles omalley and  harry lorrequer	northamerica_contra
B4013	"['8986856', '6670816', '3278414']"	  the ms in a red box lane the author of this romance has had the good fortune to hit upon a period in history which has not been hackneyed by general use we remember no other novel in which the draining of the fens by dutchmen under charles i is the mainspring of the plot it is well known that this improvement roused the fierce hostility of the people of the fens and it is that hostility which the author employs in his stirring narrative thus the tale has this to the good that it has a natural colour particular to it and is in consequence of somewhat a different shape from the multitude of romances technically termed  historical unhappily the characterization has little to distinguish it from the ruck of such performances the hero frank vavasour is the usual brave and reckless young fellow in love with a fair maiden as is habitual with such tales the hero is so headstrong as to run into every danger that a man with a grain of common sense would have avoided as is also usual he tells his own tale very modestly of course and sings the praises of his ladylove not so modestlyas is natural and the two chief villains are exactly what we looked forthe one dutch and the other an english nobleman they are blackened to a hair and could not be whitewashed by the most ingenious perverter of history but of a truth they glory in their shame and are calculated to fill unsophisticated minds with the most passionate feelings of revenge for the colours are all primitive and the drawing is with crayons not that that matters in this style of book it is sufficient that there should be plenty of incident which there is and that the narrative should amble briskly which it does the writing too is of quite a spirited order so that there is little wanting to make a good book of adventure rather above the average and possibly the earnest of better work by its anonymous author  the ms in a red box lane 6s tue mystery of the ms of this story has been so much exploited that we need not refer to it further here save to pay that the book itself comes rather as an anticlimax for though it is a pleasant and reasonably interesting book it is no better than dozens of volumes which have appeared during say the past three years the author has a faculty for narrative sufficient invention and enough knowledge of his period to carry the thing through  in a word he is a good mechanic but there is no characterisation in the story the hero is the very type of the conventional hero and the three villains are very types of the conventional villain the hero sails triumphantly through all dangers to happiness and the lady and the villains come by their deserts there are a good many minor characters but they come in merely as accessories indeed the experienced reader can tell at once just why they make their appearance but all this is not to say that the book is not goed of its kind the setting is careful and accurate and the conflict between the folks of axholme and the dutch engineer vermuijden who had charles the firsts authority to drain and embank the isle is vigorously described the manner of the book smacks rather of wardour street purely modern phrasing and almost slang clash unpleasantly with an artificial archaism but here again the author merely sins with most of those secondclass writers of romance with whom at present he must be classed yet the story has promise and a kind of ease and briskness which experience may turn to good account and at least the book is wholesome and manly and cleanblooded  the ms in a red box 6s lane mysterious and ingenious rumours and advertisements had raised our expectations to such a height that  the nis in a red box must hai e been a very e xt raord r in a ry book inceed if it had come ip to them it is not a lery extraordinary book but it is distinctly good and if it had not been so overshadowed by its antenatal reputation it would have seemed even better it is a brisk capable romance of the accepted latterday patterr laid in the lincolinsiire fen country in the reign of charles i  it has the usual fearless but somewhat slowwitted hero who plunges into a fresh peril every time lie goes out of doors is f r e q u e n t i y wounded and once left for eead but always comes through triumphantly the usual faitlful retainer the usual lovely much persecuted heroine the usual dashing villain whose schemes to kidnap her invariably fail at the right moment the usual crop of glaring coincidences and the usual happy end but some of the minor

passionately concentrated herself on the two leading characters that the minor  figures are carelessly imagined and drawn without force or originality but it will be read for its extraordinary  and pitiless analysis of a very woman of the time the effect achieved is one of unrelieved misery for ourselves we say franklyand it is a tribute in a way to the writers powerthat we regret having opened

might be thought to redeem any existence from despair yet it leads but to deeper sorrows motherhood yields no consolation it seemed inexplicable to her that women went on travailing and giving birth that a woman who had once known the agony of maternity should consent to bear a second a third or a fourth child struck her as ridiculous she closed her eyes and laughed the experienced novelreader

it the book  abruptly ends it is not to be disputed that ellen glasgow has obtained a brilliant success if her aim was to impress the miserable doctrine that life is not worth living were such a mournful philosophy well founded its dissemination could only end in discouragement and decay but her insight is not equal to her powers of observation the best of her work is largely made up of

moments of despair but none has attained real greatness who has cast the shadow of these over all life  we bid you to hope was the final message of the greatest writer of this century and one cannot

with some decency he repulses her at first then succumbs to her fascinations and only her death saves his cutting his pastorship and running off with her to the sunny south the story is aimless

allusions to them in modern writings but to confine himself exclusively to them appears to be a downright loss of time there are many excellent works of a later date which may not only serve as better models of the style of the present day but likewise convey far more information with regard to the present state of the empire and the character of the people and as has been before observed multitudes of amusing dramas and novels from which may be selected much curious matter what we now want is a little practical know ledge of chinese literature instead of speculative dissertations on the nature ofthe language this volume contains three novels entitled  the shadow in the water c the twin sisters and the  three dedicated chambers they are all much too long for our insertion but we shall take the commencement of the second novel  the twin sisters which will afford a good specimen of the general style of these tales  early in the reign of an emperor of the ming dynasty there dwelt in a city of the province of hookwang a merchant named siaoukiang who had the misfortune to live on very indifferent terms with his wife they were for a long while without any family until after a lapse of many years two daughters twins were born to them it is a popular remark that sons generally resemble the father and daughters though motlier but these two sisters contrary to what is usum ally the case did not inherit the features of either of theil parents and they seemed like the children of some other family neither was the difference confined to their persons for their dispositions were quite as dissimilar as the father and mother wore extremely plain and very stupid so on the contrary the daughters were very handsome and particularly clever after ten years of age they began to resemble fair flowers glittering with dew or fragrant herbs agitated by the breeze  and their beauty every day increased until having reached the age of fourteen or fifteen no one could behold them without emotion not only were the young men in love with them but even those ofa more advanced age when they beheld  aaa confessed the power of their chara 4 their dispositions were extremely docile but notwithstanding this they lia i loamed but little and the xvhole extent of their knowledge xvas confined to figures as to though use of the needle and other female accomplishments they needed but little instruction in order to acquire them their dress and ornaments were from their station in life coarse and ordinary but vet when these txvo girls were compared xvith the daughters of more wealthy   their father beni a mcichautd and dignified persons it was allowed by all that they need not change their homely dress and metal ornaments for the silks and jewek of the others  as they were so very handsome and engaging it naturally followed that the young men of fortune and family should seek them  the good man and his dame were more like enemies than husband and wif the former wanted to marry his daughters without the interference ofthe latter and his wife on the other hand wished to obtain two scnsinlaw without the know ledge of her husband with this principle of mutual deceit they each of them secretly engaged with their sepaiate friends  though the father was severe in his own house he was naturally of a kind and friendly disposition  not like his wife whose turbulence led her when provoked to make the neighbourhood ring with her violence people therefore said to themselves that it would be an easier thing to dupe him than her aid that of the two it was better to aid the wife than the husband hence it was that the latter was more successful in her adherents than the former and after a little while for each of her daughters a husband was selected a fortunate day wtas chosen for the marriage and they the bridegrooms were desired to send the wedding presents  but with a view to prevent her husbands disapprobation and rejection of the match he was kept in ignorance of the whole  there were some sensible persons who said that the propriety of a daughters marriage ought to be determined by the father and that if the mother would not consent the matter should be referred to the magistrate who would neversule with an obstinate woman nor put add the husband for the sake of favouring the wife these persons wanted to get somebody to make their proposals to the former hut unfortunately all those whom they asked proved to be as ready to deceive him as they were afraid of his wife and when inmr  vited to act against her they immediately made some pretext for declining they dared not to incur her resentment saying that if they offended the husband they had nothing to do but tt wait irntd he broke out and then reason with him  and if he was violent they might still go and complain to the magistrate but if they offended his wife and her anger was excited it was not fit for them to contend with a woman  and should she abuse and even chastise them they must bear it and could do nothing in return  thus it was that no one would consent to assist those who wished to make proposals to the good man and they were accordingly obligt d to open the subject to him in person isle had been very much nettled at seeing people in the first inst ince go to his wife without coming t consult him and therefore on the present occasion when the marriage of his daughters was proposed to him he echoed ln consent vdth great satisfaction and made not the slightest obj dion  lio suitors told him that every one was afraid of his wife and tiiat for this reason none would act as mediators what therefore was to bo done isle replied  when the parties are unknoxvn to each other it is necessary to make use of snell agents  but when 1 have already

narrow and his characters crudely conventionalised is beside the point for all art is narrow when compared to life and all art must be more or less conventional without convention one could not have

namie of the author of  ouo vadis and there was ample room for introducing to them a powerful specimen of this younger novelists work gasiorowski is described bv his translator as an enilhusiastic admirer  of napoleon whose ardour is baed upon original research that of itself does not make a good hiktorical ronance but one is bound to admit that this long dramatic tale of the polish beautv madame de alewska with her aged jealous conceited beau of a huvband and her unselfish quixotic and fatal passion for napoleon carries the reader to the end with an intvrest that sldom slackens it is a subtle tragic episode the character of the heroine with her disappointed idal i9 handled with insight and vivid sympathy so are most of the minor figuresthev live and move napoleon is less attractive hi roic is senslial and selfish but the general impression left on the mind by a perusal of this fine though by no nmean great romance is distinctly one f trenth and directness in characterisation the tranilation reads fairly well but wvhv are so many spaces in the lines filled up with dots throughout the dialogue and the dtecription they have an ugly telegraphic look  flctlbtf napoleons love story by waclaw gamorowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth 6s we have read every word of this story with the greatest pleasure and interest and count de soissons claim in his brief introduction that gasiorowski though he does not bring into literature any new element is a very able master of the historical romance originated by sir walter scott is entirely justified the title alone seems a mistake napoleon either had no lovestory or he had a good many here we are concerned only with his brief passion or marie walewska a polish lady who was as good as she was beautiful and who belonged to that petite noblesse from which gasiorowski is himself sprung she bore the emperor a son alexandre walewski who afterwards became french ambassador at the court of st james represented france at the funeral of the duke of wellington and achieved a certain literary reputation he was a man with a heart of gold highminded and extraordinarily disinterested and it is evident to judge by this story that he inherited these qualities from his mother marie walewska married at twenty to a wealthy courtier of eighty conceived a romantic admiration for napoleon and the story depicts in the most moving and vivid manner her feelings when she begins to understand the real meaning of the emperors attentions that she yielded to him was a supreme act of selfsacrifice for she is led by the old polish statesman malachowski to believe that she will revive by her influence the fallen glories of her country she has a brother a humble lieutenant who learns of her shame which is at the same time the explanation of his sudden promotion to a colonelcy there is a dramatic scene between them not only does he cast her off but he throws in her face papers which contain damning proof of napoleons treachery to the polish cause to this succeeds a picture of quiet domesticity at schoenbrunn and then madame walewska is called to the deathbed of an old playmate of her childhood an officer named gorayski the emperor is bent on the austrian marriage and so a guilty colour is placed on the wholly innocent visit to gorayski and madame walewska is banished to poland not the least striking part of the book is her life when she returns to her aged husbands castle and the description of his reverential adoration of her baby son whom he always calls imperial highness we have had to pass over much that is admirable notably the scenes in paris the birth of the king of rome and the appearance of poor eleonore augier but we must mention the wonderful picture of polish society when napoleon first appears in warsawthe figures of talleyrand de segur duroc prince borghese davoust and many others mingling with the crowd of greedy courtiers and worldlywise women with whom madame walewskas native innocence and purity are strikingly contrasted yet the central allcompelling figure of the book is napoleon whether present or absent he is the determining force the masterspirit in whom every one is merged  napoleons love story by waclaw gasio rowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth  co m de soissons the translator of this romance of napoleon at warsaw tells us that the author is a napoleonic enthusiast so much may be gathered from the clear and vivid presentment of the fate of the virtuous and patriotic polish lady whose sorrows and betrayal at the hands of her ideal seem to evoke no contempt in the narrator to us it seems one of the meanest acts of one of the worlds great men poor mary walewska died for her enthusiasm  and in so doing only accentuated in her person the suffering entailed by the tyrant on the mass of her deluded countrymen the date is of course that of bonapartes presence in warsaw in 1807 when the revolutionary cloak had been abandoned and he was beginning to assimilate the pose of universal caesar the author a wellknown member of the school of sienkiewicz has given us a graphic study of polish society a century ago and the story though suffering to an english taste from rather too copious dialogue has many dramatic and some tragic passages while the characters especially that of the vain old courtier walewski are clearly cut the translation is well done but for a certain spasmodic method of conversation and a few slips of idiom	northamerica_contra

fertility of invention and vivacity of style are indisputable  than this quite alone is unpleasant from the predominance of odious people to whom it introduces us blunt the heroine lilys father is one of those disgraceful men of pleasure who delight in flinging themselves down headlong ruining every one that touches or trusts themand whose death as it were on a dunghill excites more disgust than

would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed

B1990	['8991356']	  north of the tweed or lorance langton his life incidents and adventures in scotland by daniel crowberry 3 vols newby we have been highly amused with this book not that the author intended it to be funny far from it indeed it is the authors perfect unconsciousness of saying anything humorous that makes us laugh so the book is written with such profound gravity and selfcomplacency that what would otherwise be insufferable becomes very amusing we remember a parallel case some time ago there was an   i flr    amateur representation of  macbeth to which the numerous friends of the actors were compelled to go with anything but lively anticipations of enjoyment to their delight what was expected to bea most tedious affair turned out a perfect success macbeth was so wonderfully  got up and delivered his speeches with such preternatural solemnity and was evidently so delighted with himself and his acting that the audience roared again every syllabic he uttered caused shouts of laughter much to his astonishment but s hestillweuton in thc sam style he unwittingly kept up the fun to thc end of the enteiiaiinitnt by these means a badlyacted tragedy became a most enjoyable farce so hero thanks to our appreciation ot the humorous a tedious novel is made really amusing were it not for this we fear our criticism would be more severe as it is though author is perfectly safe we cannot find much fault with a book that has made us laugh so the author says in the third volume of  north of the tweed that it is not a novel at all perhaps this is some peculiar fun of mr crowberry some joke known only to a few for if it is not a novel what is it we really cannot say it certainly is not a book of travels nor a book of anecdotes it is perhaps best described as an edd and not very agreeable mixture of the three things the first volume so lav as we can judge was apparently intended for a novel at any rate there is some appearance of a tale  but to the readers surprise and our amusement this story comes to an abrupt termination at the end of the volume the second volume has no reference to the firstnor in faet t lung at all iii particular the hero of the first volume certainly appears iu though second but that is the only connexion between them it puzzles us to make out what mr crowberry intended the second volume to be we have thought over it and as a puzzle it h amusing but it beats us we cannot understand what it means it is such a curious medley that it must be read to be appreciated we warn the reader though that tue only entertainment he can hope to find is in wondering at the incongruities and pomposity of style beyond this he will be bored in the third volume the author takes another stait and having satisfied his taste for meandering in the second volume rathor inclines to give his audience another story this intention however is not strictly carried out for the meandering continue at diverse intervals throughout the last volume but still there is some kind of reference to a talc for which the reader will feel grateful or not according to his taste even the author shows once in the como of his work symptoms of an idea that it is not quite cn rijlc to drag into his novel stray anecdoteof about eighty pages or so wliei it has not the remotest connexion with what precedes and follows it and when mr crowberry himself owns that it is not amusing this remarkable once occurs at page 172 of the third volume we specify it thus particularly as it possesses a certain interest for though philosophical critic it proves that even though most eccentric author has occasional glimpses of right and wrong in reference to his novel just as the most depraved criminal occasionally exhibits signs of penitence and remorse so the author at this remarkable page 172 shows that even he knows what crimes he has been guilty of as a novelwriter this is what mr crowberry says   were we now engaged in writing a novel  it would become our first consideration to choose or invent such incidents for our work as seemed best calculated to sustain an uniform interest or stimulate the curiosity of those who honoured us with their favour such may be termed the high or popular road of romance but as we are occupied in recording a succession of humble events either relating personally to the subject of our narrative or coming directly under his observation in the courso of his rambling life ice are constrained to dealicith matters as they come before us commonplace as they may seem the present incident    possesses nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or cen to a place in our pages nothing beyond the actual fact of its existence enid of having attained consielereible notoriefy at the time of its occurrence observe in the beginning of this quotation how the guilty author tries to excuse himself while confessing his crime how natural this is  no man ever acknowledged himself guilty of a crime without a reservation the confession always nins  i know i did it but and the  but clearly proves it was some one elses fault that the crime in question was committed but what does mr crowberry mean by saying were we now engaged in writing a novel really when we listen to excuses like this we feel quite inclined to lose our good humour and be severe how can mr crowberry be so cool as to say that he is  constrained to deal with matters as they come before him commonplace as they may seem   who constrains him  certainly not the public in fact we cannot see how an englishman can be compelled to write a book though he had even contracted to do so the court of chancery itself would never decree specific performance of a contract to write a book it may be different in scotland  but even if it be so the courts in scotland ought clearly not to have constrained mr crowberry to publish his book in england there must be some mistake somewhere seriously mr crowberry is in this dilemma either he wrote to please the public or to please himself and a few friends in the first case it is clear he ought not to have wilfully written trash that he knew to be uninteresting to the public generally in though second case mr crowberry should have printed a few copies for private circulation when he published the book to the world the excuse as to his being compelled to write nonsense fell to the ground  for though he and his friends may prefer uninteresting and disconnected stories they have no right to force their peculiar taste on the public at large to conclude mr crowberry ought not to spoil a good confession by frivolous excuses the simple truth is the author knew to use his own words that the incident possessed nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or even to a place in his pages yet out of pure obstinacy he inserted it i knew i ought not to stead that coat and yet i did steal it that is the authors

selection and translation are alike characteristic and spirited  and with one exception we believe the tales to be quite new to the english reader the exception is the first tale the libusea of musasus a wellknown writer of the last century whose collection of popular stories volhs miirchen was edited by wieland his works ara classical but we must think them somewhat vulgar and cannot but applaud the omission of needless indelicacies in the translation of this very tale libussa is an excellent example of the spirit in which he took up old legends and of the halfmodern satirical garb he dressed them in two very powerful stories somewhat alike in their moral drift are the criminal from lost honour of schiller and the michael kohl haas of heinrich von kleist schillers would show that the extremes of guilt are never more surely engendered than by degrading punishments awarded to trivial offences von kleists that a man driven to desperation by the denial of justice may be made a criminal by his outraged sense of right this latter tale is unequal but we know few things in fact or fiction more masterly than the first half of it the scene where with forced calmness michael listens to the outrages committed on his servant is a piece of high tragedy the writer afterwards plunges into historical detail and somewhat soils his fancy with the thick dust of german chronicles but heinrich von kleist not to be confounded with an older author christian ewald von kleist was a remarkable person he belonged to what was called the romantic school bis works are edited by tieck at the beginning of the century and several of bis dramas particularly the kiithchen von heilbronn still keep the stage he bad a morbid aud sickly temperament and so much was this embittered by his hatred of the french invasion that he killed himself in 1811 when little more than thirty years of age two other stories in the collection may be named together as alike in tendency and belonging to the same class of vivid thoughtful satirical fantasy pieces these are the sandman of hoffman and the wonders in the spessart of karl von immermann we see in both the intention to laugh at the speculative and morbid tendencies of the germans and in both that nice and curious art which leaves the reader doubtful if the means employed have been fanciful or real there is no such natural form of supernaturalism as the german other nations at the best make clumsy work of it we should like to have quoted from the sandman which for the mingled satirical fantastical and horrible is a masterpiece of hoffmans brilliant genius but we can better detach one or two of the imaginative wonders of the spessart by immermann whose sudden death two or three years ago in the prime of his life and intellect was a great loss to german literature the hero of the story a disciple of albertus magnus in other words of the archspeculator hegel obtains sight of the interior life of the universe  in the block of mossy rock a light murmuring was audible it seemed as though the stone wished to move itself and could not like one in a trance the student looked upon its surface and lo i the green and red veins were running together into a very ancient countenance which from its weary eyes looked upon him with such a mournful and supplicating aspect that he turned aside with horror and sought consolation among the trees plants and birds  among these all was changed likewise when he trod on the short brown moss it shrieked and groaned at the unsentle pressure and he saw how it rung its little hairy ands and shake its gr j en or yellow heads the stems of the plants and the trunks of the trees were in a constant spiral motion and at the same time the bark or the outer skin allowed him to look into the inside where little sprites were pouring fine glistening drops into the tubes the clear fluid ran from tube to tube while valves unceasingly opened and shut until in the capillary tubes of the leaves at the very top it was transformed to a green bloom soft explosions and ure now arose in the veins of the leaves  their finely cut lips ceaselessly breathed forth a kind of

did not mre his masters treasures and still tess did he spare himself he was seen all day at the fire enveloped by clouds of smoke and his voice constantly resounded through the vaults of the kuchen for he governed the scullions and under cooks  during a fortnight the foreign prince lived happily and feasted sumptuously with the duke they ate not uss than five times a day and the duke was delighted with his dwarf seeing satisfaction expressed on the countenance of his ifutt hut on the fifteenth day it happened that the duke while at table sent for the dwarf presented him to his guest and asked bow he was satisfied with his cooking m  you are a wonderful cook replied the prince and know what good living is all the time 1 have been here you have not repeated a single dish and have prepared everything exquisitely hut pray tell me why have you not all this time prepared that queen of dishes the pie called  souseraine    the dwarf was startled at this question for he had never heard of this queen of pies however he recovered himself aud replied c my lord 1 was in hopes that your serene countenance would shine some time yet on this court therefore i deferred this dish  for with what dish ut the queen of pies should the cook honour the day of your departure v  indeed said the duke laughing  i suppose then you wish to wait for the day of my death to honour me for you have never yet sent it up to me but think of another dish to celebrate the departure for tomorrow that pie must be on the table m  your pleasure shall be done my lord replied the dwarf and retired but he went away uneasy for the day of his disgrace and misfortune had come he did not know now to prepare this pie isle went therefore to his chamber and wept over his fate when the goose mimi who was allowed to walk about came up and inquired the cause of his grief when she heard of the pie  dry your tears said she  this dish came often to my fathers tible and i know pretty well what is necessary for it you have only to take such and such things in certain quantities and should these not be all that are really necessary i trust that the taste of these gentlemen is not sulhciently refined to discover the deficiency  at these words the dwarf danced with joy blessed the day on which he had purchased the goose and set about making this queen of pies he first made a trial in miniature and lo the flavour was exquisite and the mastercook to whom he gave the small pie to taste praised once more his great skill l the following day he prepared the pie un a larger scale and after having garnished it with flowers sent it hot as it came from the oven to table after which he dressed in his best and went to the dining hall on entering he found the steward engaged in carving the pie and presentnig it on silver dishes to the duke and his guest the duke swallowed a large piece turned his eyes upward saying  ha  ha ha  jutlv is this called the queen of pies  but my dwarf is also a king of cooks is it not so my friend   his guest took a small morsel tasted it carefully and smiled somewhat scornfully and mysteriously the thing is made pretty well replied he pushing his plate away but it is not quite the soueraine as i well imagined  at this the duke frowned with indignation and turned red saying  you hound of a dwarf how dare you do this to your lord i i will have your big head cut off as a punishment for your bad cooking    1     ah my lord said tfte duart tremnung  xor neaveu s sake have compassion on me  i have made that dish indeed according to the proper receipt and am sure that nothing is wanting   tis a lie you knave replied the duke giving him a kick  tis a lie else my guest would not say there was something wanting i will have you yourself cut up and baked in a pie   have compassion on me  exclaimed the dwarf shuffling on his knees up to the prince and clasping his feet  tell me what is wanting to this pie and why it does not suit your palate  let me not die for a handful of meat or flour   this will not avail you my good nose replied the prince laughing  even yesterday i thought you would not be able to make this dish as well as my cook know there is wanting a herb called sneezewithpleasure which is not even known in this country without it this pie is insipid and your master will never eat it in such perfection as i do  at this the duke flew into a rage and cried with flashing eyes   i will eat it in perfection yet for i wear by my princely honour that by toinoirou i will either have the pie set before you such as you desire it or the head of this fellow shall he spiked on the gate of my palace go you hound i give vou once more twentyfour hours cried the duke now the herb wanted is the very herb that will disenchant the dwarf and being

B4009	"['9464285', '4359285']"	  the works of thomas hood comic and serious tn prose and verse london saturday april ll 1863 literature edited with notes by his son moxon  co a new generation of readers has arisen to welcome though collected works of thomas hood some of us remember the pleasant hum and glow of expectancy with which we waited for the advent of one of his books far off its coming shone in the faces of young and old its presence was greeted with eyes that danced and lungs that crowed and sides that shook its merry memory was a joy for ever and there are the same human hearts to be set beating the same eager faces of youth to be set dimpling  the same wrinkles on the face of age to be turned into ripples of laughter now as of old there is no fear that these works will ever fail of their old effect thomas hoods poems anti punpictures whims and oddities have taken their place in our affections they now ask a little more room on our shelves and that we can promise for them their author has established his right as a favourite of the english heart to have all his writings carefully gathered and garnered up we like to know all we can of him and have all that we can of his whilst an author is living we only ask for his bestthe nuggets of his gold but when he is dead and gone we are glad to get the  washings and like to see careful hands seeking diligently for the golden grains we judge the writer by his lumps but do not despise the golddust thousands of faces will bend and brighten over these pages for more years than we can count merry eyes will twinkle with the light from these books so funnily reflected young faces will grow glorious and young voices uproarious a will goethe wisp light will flit about the family circle there will be sly ticklings at the very heartroots by a tricksy spirit and these will out suddenly in inextinguishable mirth there will be leaning heads of lovers that bend together with one heart over the book and two hands clasped beneath the table quiet chuckles of old hearts that laugh helplessly within there will be still higher reward for the writer the world will pay for its smiles in gold but keep its pearls of heart for those that make it weep this success is hoods and in shy ways and shady places a tear will be the still more eloquent witness of his moving powerthe noblest payment for the pleasure we find the wit untarnished by time  the fun has lost none of its freshness enjoyable as ever are the old perfectest of puns whether in picture or verse hoods puns flash every time they go offbeing for all not one time as for example his death which happened in his birth at fortyodd befell they went and told the sexton and the sexton tolled the bell or speaking of orient nations vhere woman goes to mart the same as mangoes or let us look at what we call his punpictures of the  whims and oddities it is noticeable that the wit kept some of his best wine  in the wood and dealt it out fresh on draught who ever tyres of that scene where the heads of two quakers are visible just above the ice on a bitter winters day and there they hang surveying each other in what ho would call an ice fix or state of suspended animation this he entitles a coolness between friendsor the view of a particularly bald old gentleman who has just upset a beehive and how doth the little busy bee improve each j shining second on the bald shining head  this i he calls an unfortunate beeingor the j  spoilt child wherein the servant is sitting with  the infant tinder her care she quietly reading her j paper and comfortably killing the child  then there is that unforgetable last in bed to put out the light wherein the worthy couple in all haste dash at the bedclothes making ends meet and heads clash at the same momentand its not a laughing matter but whos to put out the light  we might refer to an infinite variety of merry thoughts that will bear an endless picking out but in going over or even men j tioning the works of hood we are as leigh i hunt has said of wit and humour under a i st anthonys temptation reverseda laughable  instead of a frightful one for  thousands of  merry devils pour in on all sidesdoubles of similes buffooneries of burlesques stings in the  tails of epigrams glances of innuendoes dry looks j of ironies corpulences of exaggerations tick lings of mad fancies claps on the back of horse1 plays complacencies of unawarenesses flounder1 ings of absurdities irresistibilities of iterations j significances of jargons waitings of pretended  woes roarings of laughters and hubbubs of animal spirits the wit is showered down with all the opulence of a raincloud shedding its brightest most bountiful drops this not only represents his works but his way of working no sooner does a witty thought enter his head j but his mind is all mirrors with a hundred i reflections forthwith it is like that scene mentioned by sydney smith at the french embassy where he mistook the reflections of himself in the lookingglasses for a meeting of the clergy and not only does his mind reflect in this numerous way but it also refracts in a myriad forms that range from lilliput to brobdingnag and in every tint that can be conceived on any colourable pretext it is the moment of transformation in a mental pantomime hey presto and they are all at itchange on change and jest on jest come tripping on and tripping up and tripping over one another in as bright and bustling a bit of business as ever included the sparkle of harlequin the trick of clown the wise wag of pantaloons beard and the beauty of columbine every drop of ink from his pen every line from his pencil swarms into life with the most fantastic shapes ever assumed by the merriest imps of mirth and mischief that play bopeep with face and mask his puns are often unanswerably absurd or unutterably wise they arc the sort to suit charles lamb who next to a good pun loved a good bad one they either shut you up or you must laugh there is nothing else for it if you are wise you will laugh they are also the sort to obviate what charles lamb thought would be though greatest inconvenience of being in utter darkness viz if you made a pun you would have to feel all over your friends face before you knew whether he was enjoying it in fact it would have to be a broad grin for you to perceive it with hoods the laugh would be too ready and ringing he makes instant appeal to another kind of feeling he looked upon a pun he says as a horsewith him it was pegasushaving a pillion for an extra sense to ride behind it is warranted to carry either single or double and so perfectly does it carry that many a grave reader  will enjoy the single sober sense and never see the second rider that sits grinning behind or to change the illustration much of his wit was the mere flashes struck out by the hoofs of the winged horse of the muses amongst the fresh features that peep out from betwixt the old faces in these new volumes we are caught and tickled by a few of hie answers to correspondents in the london magazine marking his early punning propensity he kept the sign of the  lions head in those days people only saw the head but there was also the most appropriate wag to the tail one writer is informed that his  night is too long for the moon rises twice in it we do not know whether the author retorted that it must have been at least luminous the  essay on agricultural distress would only increase it the  tears of sensibility had better be dropped b is surely humming the  echo will not answer whilst it is suggested the  sonnet to the rising sun must have been written for a lark hoods higher humour is also alone and unparagoned there is nothing like it nothing we can place near it to say what it is like amongst those that have gone before it is  hoods own it never tastes bitter ia though mouth after the enjoyment it is not cynical or destructive or gross he never laughs with rabelais in his easy chair to roll down into though mud to us the brightest gems of his humour j seem trembling into tears surely they art j tears set glittering in the sunshine there is nothing hard and dry and merely shiny the lustre is moist like that of the buttercup above al there is the clearness of a good conscience the pureness of a high heart the i aroma of a mot sweet nature the cause of i an indescribable quality of hoods wit is that this is only his other way of crying the smile is that of a sad hearts sunshine the look is ineffably pathetic as that of some dear ailing child who laughs up in the mothers face to hide its suffering and ease her heart a little thc jewels we spoke of are indeed tears live from the heart they have not been polished for future use like sheridans and set to most advantage  each others beams to share in the midst of thc merriest mood the quick ear detects a strange arresting tone in the voice j like that note of the nightingales which pierces through all her ecstasy and brings the dew into our eyes you look round the smile is still on the face but you know well enough that he has just dropped a tear within its all very funny of course but he is only making mouths at his own troubles and light of his own heavy cares he was compelled as he said to make broad grins under narrow circumstances and be a livelyhood for a livelihood so he laughed for his living because puns sold better than poetry the public were too much delighted with mr merrymau on the stage to care for sadder shows behind only those to whose eyes had been added the  precious seeing of sympathy and who listened with the heart at the ear could tell what a world of sorrow there was in the voice thomas hood made many attempts to convince the world that there lay something in his nature deeper than the wit that sparkled  on the surface that there was the true hipi pocrene under all this effervescence and dance of frolic funthe body of the wine so to speak as well as this light spirit or soul of whim that bubbled up and beaded the surface this was only a kind of laughinggaa which would escape first and the world inhaled ic so readily and liked it so lightheadedly that it would not wait for or believe in the real wine hood himself pleaded his cause so humorously in his prefaces who could believe that he was sadly seriously in earnest why the very seriousness was only all the mons provocative of laughter a more cunning way of making merriment it was like liston insisting on playing tragedy and tickling ao foregone comic conclusions into irresistible laughter so the world would not have hoods best wine it would not let him dive down into the tragic gloom of his nature for the most precious jewels that lurked there it would not hear lum in his earnest mood it insisted like elizabeth with her portrait on having his presentment without shadow he must continue to ease his heartache by laughing or by making others laugh he refers to this humorously of course in his introduction to  tylney hall wherein two of his proofreaders turn tormentors and insist on it that he was laughing when he thought he had bein crying  thu muimis bogan and i confess to my astonishment his main objection to my novel insinuated a dearth of though pathetic  not he said  but there is abundance of bloodshed and shelli ling of tears  if i recollect rightly the second volume alone contains a divorce arson burglary and suicide hut what of that excuse me sir for saving so but we know your tricks we are not such fools as to snivel when all the while you are grinning at us in your sleeve  well you ania nie sir said f involuntarily lifting up my hands it was my own iinj r sion that on the when  my iiou was too sombre excuse me answered tlc ihou iou

choked in my pint of stout  and i wish you had i exclaimed testily nettled beyond patience at such a reception of my pt rfropv so he breath las comic vein and let thc most of his lite out in that way hood was within himself the one gi eat antithesis out of which sprang the antithetic character of his writings with the roots of his life deeply grasping grave realities ho was bidden to bear only dowers and fruit of merry fancy this antithesisthe couta t and explosion of two oppositeswill be lound one of the chief means on which he relies for obtaining his endsor rater it was so natural as to act unconciouly holli n hi punsand his pathos in ins witty rhymes his mind is continually catching the light at ihe oddest possible angle and this angle so to speak is a corner round which the two meeting extremes rush into each others arms in a collision which shocks them with surprise and the lookerson with laughter in the serious poetry rho finest effect is often antithetical lu the song of the shirt he tells us the singer sai  sewing at once wim  ilorue thread a shroud ila well as a skirt and she exelac s  mi iol tl  brr d should be so dear and utsli and blood so cheap in the  dream of eugene aram he makes the murderer say of himself and his victim a dozen times i groaned thu dead had never yimaned but twice this tendency to antithesis we say was thc natural outcome ami expression of his life and literary conditions it is only work of fane rather than of imagination  comparison rather than creation hut then this was a fellow ol excellent fancy as well as infinite jest we are sometimes apt to forget how rare wa the fancy of this poet how genuine was tin feeling the world is still beguiled by thc dazzling brilliance of though punster could ti more graceful fancy have been embodied in ai apology to one whose birthday was in noveni ber than we find in these lines i i have brought no roses sweetest i could und no flowers dear  lt was when all sweets were over thou wert lorn to hess the year and compensation enough say we for this was the woman who made sunshine in the shady places all through the saddest parts of the year of hoods life a prettier fancy was never exquisitely wrought than the plea of the midsummer fairies in which the mighty magician shakespeare rescues the small people of elfin world from old time and mortal doom to confer on them immortality the whole poem has the freshness and fragrance and rathe bloom of fancy take for illustration this picture of a weeping child  his pretty pouting mouth witless of speech tny half way open like a rose lipped shell and his young cheek was softer than a peach  hereon his tearstor roundness could not dwell lint iniickly rolled themselves to pearls and feu some on thc grass and some against his hand or

delicate loveliness the mot evanescent graces being caught and reflected in its crystal clearness it is a wave of the true wand that calls up this lustrous white vision a solitary swan lier breast of snow launches against the wave that seems to freeze into a chaste reflection still below twin shadow of herself wherever she may go and orth shu paddles in the very noon i if ollim midnight like nu elfin thing  harmed into being by thc argent moon  lioe silver light for love of her fair wing  lue with her in the shade still worshipping mit dainty plumage all around her grew a radiant circlet like a fairy ring and all behind a tiny little clue lf liht to guide her back across the waters blue this swan is of course a princess in disguise to do some mighty work of love and thus the chill white vision is made warm with a beating hum heart we are inclined to prize these and other poems of pure fancy all the more because of the circumstances under which they were written their author had to do figuratively what the shipwrecked camoens did literally tint i bring his poetry on shore in his teeth having to strike out for his life with hands and feet it is a pity that he could not have been writing immortal poetry often when he had to make the accustomed pyrotechnic display of punsa pity that he had to grind down so much of his mental seedcorn into daily bread speaking of the poor poet whose ambrosia may be sure but whose bread is very uncertain he says  pure fame is a glorious draught enough and the striving for it a noble ambition  but alas few can afford to drink it neat across the loftiest visions of the poet eai thly faces will flit and even while he is gazing on castaly little familiar voices will murmur in his ear inquiring if there are no fish that can be eaten to be caught in its waters and there being no fish in castaly he had to angle in other streams and so he laughed and coughed laughed aud spit blood laughed and made the public laugh as we say till the tears ran down its face at last for it learned at length that this was  a fellow who could play the fool to a higher purpose than it had thought he will touch the heart yet as well as tickle the ear theres a barb to his arrow and when he has driven it well home you will scarcely feel inclined to play with the feather at the other end which winged it to the heart you invited him to a banquet of mirth and it went on merrily as though the feast would never end you asked for a jester to jingle the bells on follys cap and he did your bidding bonnily but he will also show you that motley is not the only wear he is no longer puck or clown or jester you look up and see a quiet man in black with a face gradually whitening and waning in the deathshadow there is a set sternness about his mouth a grim earnestness lights up the eye he has another story to tell now another song to sing he has risen to his highest stature lengthening in deathand in his grandest character to plead the cause of the poor no longer the funny favourite of the drawingroom he is out in the street singing a song that will thrill through the heart of england there is something singularly touching in the sound as of a voice almost choked with tears there is something doggedly stern in the march of the measure as though it must be uttered thus to get it out at all he sings the  song of the shirt and you must listen ladies who move so high above the world of the poor and sit in their beauty like pictures of life in the boudoirs frame of gold or lie down to sleep in a fairy land of rest will be compelled to come out on the balcony to hear more of the song and see more of the sights the poet has to show them kindhearted old gentlemen will lay down their paper with a  bless me and begin fumbling in their breechespocket many young men got a new glimpse of life and its duties from the moment that hood unveiled his two acts of one great tragedy of poverty and showed the grim facts naked in their sternness as shroudless corpses it is now twenty years since hood sang with a heart aching for humanity his famous  song of the shirt and the bridge of sighs but they left echoes in the heart of his country which can never die the rich and poor have in many ways and through many doors looked moro closely into the face of each other than they had ever done before and not only did those songs set many to work in all worthy ways inspiring many schemes for the alleviation of suffering and for the benefit of thetoiling poor they likewise left a subtler sense a readier ear a quicker sympathy on the part of the rich so that when the cry of want and distress runs like the fiery cross through the land there is an instantaneous response as in the case of our present great national calamity  the works of thomas hood the question colxdica neene pocaa  is as old at least as the time of horace and few in the present day would share his hesitation in giving an affirmative answer but the critic of hood is mnet at the outset by the further inquiry whether real excellence of both kinds serious and comic is likely to be found in the same writer that such a combination is possible is settled conclusively by the example of shakespeare but one swallow does niot make the spring the fact we take to be this that the highest poetical genius is inseparable from some sense of humour just as the deepest moral earnestness is never disjoined from irony  witness to go no further platos dialogues and st pauls epistles mliltons genius was essentially trafgic but he condescended to a punning elegy on the  university carrier burns is as felicitous when he is funny as when he is pathetic  the power of the author of  in mlenoriam  is not least conspicuous in the grimn hunmour of the  vision of sin on the other hand  comic genius of the highest order could hardly exist without almost equal powers of an opposite kind though many accidents of temperament or circuhlnstance might prevent their being equally displayed  but the converse does not hold true to the same extent it is impossible to doubt that aristophanes could have written tragedies had he been so minded but we cannot conceive a1schylus composing the frosg these remarks seem the natural preface to a notice of hood who is about equally admired as a comic and a serious author and has in both capacities attained considerable eminence his prose works though the most bulky are the least impol ant portion of his remains the contributions to the  comic annual are the most characteristic and the best and as e p hemueral proluctions deserving of high praise but even these occasionally give us the impression of a writer who had to say something rather than of one who had something to say his national tales a series of short love stories are readable but commonplace in fact nature clearly did not intend him for a novelist his only elaborate attempt of the kind  tylney hall cannot be considered a success there are several amusing people among the minor characters and some very amusing scenes as especially mr twiggs feat shampeter but the principal characters of the tale or those who ought to be such are inadequately drawn and the plot is unnatural and melodramatic to the last degree with a superabundant allowance of villainies and murders it is in fact merely an average sensation novel with humorous incidents interspersed and if it repays perusal it is for the sake of the fun not of the story hoods humour is genial rather than caustic and  the works of thomas hood comic and serious in pros and verse edited with notes by his son seven vuls loudon efward moxon  co doverstreet 1862 reminds us more of dickens than of thackeray but he does not share the peculiar facility of the former in delineating the grotesque aspects of life below stairs or rival the power of either in sustained elaboration of character justice rivers mr twigg uriah bundy and unlucky joe are admirable sketches in their way  but there are no pecksniffs or becky sharps a charitablydisposed lady once said when asked her opinion of a very dull sermon that it was entirely on the side of religion and virtue this praise may safely be accorded to all that hood has written the moral is excellent but it is not always iu pressive in a  voyage up the rhine consisting of imaginary letters from different members of the travelling party to their friends at home he is far more successful there is little pretence of a regular story and plenty of room for play of wit the hypochondriac uncle who  went off at once quite insensible and was at the point of death every time he fell into an aifterdinner nap  the conventional english tourist railing at foreign customs and raving incoherently in foreign churches  and the estimable mrs twisleton who never closed her eyes for a week after catholic emancipation for fear of being converted in her sleep are but specimens of the general style of these highly entertaining epistles which might be indefinitely multiplied indeed the essentially comic nature of  our family the authors last novel left unfinished at the time of his death shows that he had then learned where his true strength as a prose writer lay we rise from the perusal of this portion of his works with the impression strong on our minds which was lately expressed by a successor and admirer of hoods in one of the  roundabout papers that he would have been a very charming person to know and be able to talk to nor will that impression be at all diminished when we turn as we must now do from his prose to his poetry the shorter poems like the shorter stories are better than the long ones and chiefly for the same reason it is in brief brilliant flashes whether of wit or of sentiment that hoods peculiar genius is most conspicuous the  plea of the midsummer fairies is decidedly wearisome hero and leander though generally musical and in parts very touching disappoints us as a whole and if to take a very different example  miss kilmansegg and her precious leg  be quoted against us we must reply that there too particular passages witty or pathetic form the main attraction it is rather in pathos than in power that the speciality of hoods serious powers must be sought of the latter the most striking instance is to be found in the terrible dream of eugene aram  of the former kind is the famous  song of the shirt the ladysdream  is less known but almost equally touching and oh those maidens young who wrought in that dreary room with figures drooping and spectres thin and cheeks without a bloomand the voice that cried  for the pomp of pride we haste to an early tomb for the pomp and pleasure of pride we toil like afric slaves and only to earn a home at last where yonder cypress wavesand then they pointedi vever saw a ground so full of grates   in the simplicity of the closing lines lies the secret of their exquisite pathos hood is eminently the reverse of shelley he does not idealise abstractions or dwell a hermit spirit in a land of hopes and joys and dim surmises impervious to vulgar ken his instinct is for the actual circumstances and sorrows of human life and it is mainly by particular recollections or the sufferings of particular classes as in the poems just referred to that his imaginative sympathies are evoked he throws himself outward on the world as it is not inward on his own conception of what it ought to be burning with indignation indeed against tyranny and wrong but not turning in disgust from a universe he would fain remodel almost in defiance from its maker hood would scarcely have comprehended  alastor or the  revolt of islam  still les would he have shared the strange idiosyncracy which found expression in the  cenci shelley sensitive enough to be  tender over drowning flies would have thoroughly entered into the sentiment which dictated the  song of the shirt but he would never have written it not indeed that the genius of hood can for a moment be put into competition with shelleys we have contrasted them for the sake not of marking the difference of power but the difference of idea both are in temper eminently unselfish both earnest lovers of their kind but the same feeling expresses itself in widely different forms and while to the few who can appreciate him shelley with all his faults cannot fail to be priceless hood will be popular for precisely the reasons which must prevent shelley from ever becoming so he utters feelings which all who have hearts can realize and in language which all can understand the poem to which these remarks least apply and alone of all which we have noticed does somewhat remind us of shelley is his fragment on the  sea of death sad were my thoughts that anchord silently on the dead waters of that passionless sea unstirrd by any touch of living breath silence hung over it and drowsy death like a gorged seabird slept with folded wings on crowded

sonnets  for instance that addressed  to an enthusiast and to  a sleeping child hood like all true poets is fond of children his comic poems are perhaps as compositions imore original though it would not be fair to say that they are more characteristic of the man that he could feel truly and deeply would be evidenced if only by his touching lines to a false friend never published during the authors lifetime with their bitter thricerepeated refrainc our hands have met but not our hearts our hands will never meet again  indeed his poems bear witness in every line to a genial nature and warm heart such feelings however are scarcely distinctive characteristics but hoods wit and play upon words is peculiarly his own so far he was probably right in thinking his speciality lay in punning this forms the charm of several of his prose writings but it comes out even more conspicuously in miany of his shorter poems the wellknown conclusion of faithless sally brown may be taken as a typical specimen of his felicitous punning c his death which happened in his berth at fortyodd befell they went and told the sexton and the sexton tolled the bell with which may be compared a verse of another

their manners and utter sighs like prisoners a great authority has lately expressed regret that hood from a false estimate of his own nobler capabilities should have devoted so much time to merely making jokes instead of taking his station as  a true genius and poet we have no wish certainly to depreciate his power of drawing our tears as well as exciting our laughter and are free to confess that we attach a much higher value to the former than to the latter gift we regret too that the constant pressure of literary engagementsfor hood did not write for his own pleasure merelyand a career cut short by premature death did not leave him time and opportunity to cultivate more fully his graver vein of thought some things he has written so exquisite in their mournful melody that we cannot help wishing we had more still we can hardly agree with mr thackeray in thinking he mistook his vocation when he devoted so much time to comic writing a man who instinctively jokes on his deathbed though he need not be so inveterate a wit as sydney smithand hood is very unlike him in many waysmust have the jocular element very thoroughly imbedded in his nature and it was no doul t this

lamllent of the children  and the dream of eugenle aram recalls in its very forni the rhyme of the ancient 1mariner but if hood is not in the higohest sense an original poet his sentiment is always noble his language often strikingly felicitous  seldom if ever commonplace it is indeed as we have already hinted in their nobility of sentiment rather than in their intellectual conception that the unity of his poelm is to be sought we do not mean that lie always writes with a directly moral aim but he is never oblivious of mioral principle or religious reverence his serious pieces are not mere lackadaisical rhapsodies his funny ones are often something more than fun the huniour may be broad occasionally flippant never purposely illnatured or profane a grenuine love of humanity with a stern hatred of oppression and an instinctive syympathy for the weaker side is the constant burden of his song the religious aspect of this feeling in its withering contempt of intolerance cant and the selfcomplacent unreality of pious optimism is strongly some perhaps would say bitterly expressed in the admirable  ode i to rae wilson the w hole poem is ain indignant protest against those pseudo

dowagers and reformed rakes while it quietly hands over the mass of sinful suffering humanity with a pious chuckle or a wellbred sigh to the  uncovenanted mercies of the lake of fire did not commend itself to him that a man who rose from the ranks should be the champion of the poor may seem natural though it does not always follow but hood is no vulgar declaimer against  bloated aristocrats it is not from want of sympathy with refinement that he pleads for the ignorant and the degraded the  song of the shirt by which he is probably most widely known even to those who know nothing else about him is the lament not less musical than intense of a clas whose sorrows have little to attract the attention of the mob orator while in the  bridge of sighsequally touching and truthful he has dared to plead the cause of a yet lower class of outcasts for whose unpardonable sin society has no absolution and whom it was not so much the fashion to compassionate and care for when hood wrote as it has happily since become a genuine principle underlies alike his graver and his gayer utterances and exalts him to a higher eminence than that of the mere sayer of witty things or the mere copyist of melodious verse we have done we hope no injury to his intellectual gifts which were considerable when we claim for him a place in the second class of poets not the first we certainly do no more than justice to his use of them when we say that they were consistently devoted to the cause of righteousness and mercy	orthamerica_contra

surprising to find many readable and vivacious pages in a novel which introduces an american millionaire with an exceedingly ambitious wife the relentless city is new york which mr benson visited last year which is presented with the rhetoric of disgust some of which even the statue of liberty inspires one characteristic fete in which an imported pearl fishery and floating refreshment tables are conspicuous items is memorably described but the dominant note of the book is perhaps rather expense of labourinability to rest than mere expenditure of cash the narrative or romantic structure of the novel is not convincing an english nobleman pays fifteen thousand pounds in blackmail to get back a letter which merely expresses an infatuation for an actress who was too magnanimous to live with him the actress herself is reminiscent of one of mr grundys stageheroines played by mrs langtry and she is responsible for the epigram  england is the home of linenwashing in public it is the one industry that remains to us there is a rather disagreeable episode of a young man who uses a consumptive tendency as a means of kindling a womans heart and from it one turns with candid relief to the pretty idyl of the english lord and the millionaires delightful daughter mr benson has certainly produced shapelier novels than this it may be urged too that his satire is rejoicingly obvious and in this

wordspinning is as brilliant as incisive as ever but it cannot be called anything else in  the luck of the vails melodrama was evident even in the  book of months which was fundamentally a by  product of mr bensons loom a keen observer could here and there note the prevalent tendency in the relentless city it appears naked and not ashamed melodrama in its middlevictorian guise each timehonoured character performs his appropriate timehonoured actions there is a maidenly heroine a hero in the primaeval guise of a belted earl who loves and marries her and an immoral but virtuous actress with whom the hero has had an early entanglement there is also a wicked villain who forges blackmailing letters to the hero seeming to proceed from the actress and causing temporary distress to the heroine the villain dies as is inevitable by violence being run over by a locomotive in a tunnel there are variations on the old theme of course the heroine is not a village beauty she is the heiress of an american millionaire the villain is not a baronet but another american millionaire the lovers are married before the villain becomes villainous instead of afterwards and he has no evil designs upon

B7680	"['6806200', '3160573', '8844031']"	  fiction a tale of the mutiny on the face of the waters by flora annie steel william heinemann mrs steels new story has been sj highly praised already vide press notices passim as quoted in the advertisements that if it were merely for the sake of a change one would be inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses there is a danger we hope it is no more that a somewhat uncritical admiration for the work of the clever lady who has now come to be spoken of as the female rudyard kipling  may do harm both to the authoress and her public the description is neither elegant nor correct for mrs steels resemblance to mr kipling begins and ends in the fact that both write about india from intimate personal knowledge and that the resemblance should strike both critics and public so forcibly is a remarkable sign of the novelty with which this inside handling of indian subjects came upon the masses in whose name our great dependency is ruled is it too much to express a fear that mrs steel has been tempted by thi reception to imagine that she has a mission to inform the british public about the true history of india  in her latest book at any rate the element of history seems to us entirely to overbalance the fiction we hasten to say that so far as the facts are concerned they are admirably portrayed mrs steels capacity as a historian of the indian mutiny is undeniable she is soaked through and through with knowledge of the environment in which she sets her story she is no partisan and her heroworship is combined with justice but after all fiction is fiction it is with some apprehension that the present writer who was one of the first to call attention to the power and beauty of those short sketches of mrs steels which came out anonymously in macmillans sees the authoress compelled to begin her new story with a preface insisting on its historical accuracy and explaining that it intended to be history as well as  story in her own criticism that in such an attempt she will probably fail in either aim mrs steel seems to us to be a better oritic of herself than most authors are it is not from a novelist that we want  every incident scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather it is not for the writer of fiction to boast that i have not allowed the actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings let the local colour be correct by all means but wc make a fetish of realism if such restrictions are put upon what in its essentials is an imaginative art the account of though sham court at delhi says mrs steel  did not need a single touch of fancy in the presentment what a singularly humiliating confession this statement should be if it were true in point of fact as all writers of picturesque history know it cannot be literally true it would only mean that the fancy of one writer was adopted by another and when that other is herself an artist in fiction the result if faithfully pursued would be a literary calamity not so do the great artists use history as scott in ivanhoe or george meredith in vittoria they learn its uses and its limitations the test of the historian is his accuracy but the critic must test mrs steele as a novelist not by her descriptions of the real scenes of the indian mutiny nor by her clever transcriptions of the chronicles but by the human beings and human characters wbich she invents the passions and ideas with which she invests them by the play of her creative talent round the creatures of her imagination as they move through the world which she has chosen as their environment and by her capacity for making an artistic unity out of the variety of circumstances it is in this respect that on the face of the waters is weak the desire to tell the whole history of the siege of delhi has interfered seriously with the human interest in the story up to p 210 there is a definite elot in the relations between major erlton is wife and his mistress but when mrs gissing falls the first of the women victims at delhi mrs steel violently removes the whole moral situation to which she seemed to be working upremoves it just at the climax when mrs erlton learns that another woman is to be a mother by her husband in a scene which till its natural sequel is ruthlessly cut off is full of promise for the working out of a most interesting problem of life alice gissing is certainly the most human of the characters in this story her relations with erlton whose wife is represented at first as bound to him by the nominal tie only are described with rare and even audacious sympathy  and when this chain of circumstance is abruptly snapped there is nothing to take its place the final two hundred pages one half of the book have no real human interest except the historical one mrs steel apparently intended the relations between jim douglas and mrs erlton to supply it but the sympathy of the reader is not aroused their adventures in the town in hiding while the mogul reigns in delhi and the british troops are besieging it from the ridge are most brilliantly narrated but they are the adventures of isolated beings both of them as bloodless as any men or women could be in such a situation and mrs steel evidently felt the mechanical aspect of their union after major erltons death when she relegated it to an appendix this division of the story into two parts one dealing with alice gissing and major erlton and the other with mrs erlton and jim douglasdeprives it of unity which is not adequately attained by the part played by douglas in both portions what unity the volume has is given by its history of the siege of delhi and to say this is to praise mrs steel the historian at the expense of mrs steel the novelist while we maintain that a great novel is not to be composed bv giving an historical background to several brilliantly interwoven episodes it must be admitted that mrs steel does ive us of her best in the way of episode in on the face of the waters all that relates to the natives whether to the sepoys or the court or the town is admirable and the sketches of british military and civil life are absolutely convincing mrs steel sees detail everywhere and records it minutely but she is full of humanity in the broader sense and can give us the mysticism of the oriental as faithfully as the easyoing morality of the angloindian each incident almost each chapter is a picture by itself revealing an extraordinary wealth of descriptive power and a masterly insight into character the disappointment is that with so muoh that is brilliant by itself the book as a whole finally lacks the intense interest which would be expected but mrs steel is so exceptionally gifted that we shall hope to see her shake off the disintegrating tendency which has so fatally pursued some of our best writers of sketches and short stories  novel notes on the face of the waters by f a steel 6s heinemann we do not meet with a novel of this order once in ten years it is a monument of patient labour a storehouse of precise facts on its imaginative side it is strong and deeply impressive architecturally it is a wonderbut we did not recognise this very early mrs steels aim was to write a history of the indian mutiny which should at the same time be a work of fiction the fiction to serve the history by lighting it up with living human interest as to her facts she says the reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part which real men took in it is scrupulously exact even in the date the hour the scene the very weather a critic of fiction has most concern with the other part and there we hold that mrs steel has used her vast array of knowledge with great skill that she has made us realise as we never did before the signs of the oncoming storm the mystery and tragedy of it the sensations of the natives loyal and disaffected and of the angloindians no one has taken such trouble before save historians and they have left the imagination out of the fineness of the detail it is impossible to speak too highly or of the great mental force that has shaped the mass of facts personalities sensations into a whole but it has the defects of its qualities a reader is sometimes overwhelmed dazed and baffled by the demands on his attention such a book should be given its best chancewhich is the careful consideration of ample leisure it is not a playhour novel but a bit ot hard reading with matter in it to reward the labour and to rouse the keenest admiration for the writers force and her sympathetic imagination  on the face of the waters new novels by flora annie steel heinemann mrs steel says in her preface  i have not allowed fiction to interfere with fact in the slightest degreeevery incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part real men took in it is scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather nor have i allowed the actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings this statement is we believe strictly accurate and the local colouring is singularly exact the tale too is as valuable as it is interesting for it gives an excellent insight into the native side of the indian mutiny and into the characters of some of the leading personages  such as for instance the king and queen of delhi the moulvie and bukht khan on the other hand it brings vividly before us the conduct and bearing of some of the principal fighters on the british side such as nicholson and hodson moreover it most wholesomely revives our recollection of the scandalous behaviour of the majorgeneral commanding at meerut and the want of energy and independence displayed by brigadier archdale wilson the author notwithstanding her general accuracy has perpetrated one or two little mistakes for example she defines krani as lowcaste english whereas it really is the contemptuous term applied to halfcastes again she is historically inaccurate when she writes of the rifle brigade having been engaged at budle  ke  serai it was the 60th rifles who took part in that action the rifle brigade not having been represented in india till several months later viewed simply as a novel the book is well and vigorously written but we regret to find that the author is unable to shake herself free from the objectionable habit prevalent among so many lady writers of dragging in the sexual question freely this blemish renders the work unsuitable for young people	northamerica_contra
