  the napoleon of notting hill by gilbert k chesterton lane humour in our day is so scarce and humourists are so few that mr chestertons farandole of farce may easily be wrongly praised it is farce but not pure farce for it often drops into buffoonery this vehement jumble of styles is fatiguing for the kingdom of humour cannot be taken by violence however brilliant farce is the staple of mr chestertons humour he is a farceur with ideas now farce is an excellent and an english thing by all means let us revive it but let us remember that humour has its laws as well as poetry or mathematics what are those laws alas humour still awaits its blackstone perhaps the best code of humour is that which is suggested by mr wattsdunton in his articleon  the renascence of wonder in chamberss  cyclopaedia of literature he points out that there are two kinds of humour absolute and relative  while in the case of relative humour that which amuses the humourist is the incongruity of some departure from the laws of convention in the case of absolute humour it is the incongruity of some departure from the normal as fixed by nature herself applying this test to mr chesterton we find that his humour is as a rule relative the incongruity which amuses him is a departure from the convention of monarchy the convention of municipal routine the convention of behaviour the convention of clothes he invents men who violate these ordinances in england eighty years hence the king is chosen like a juryman by alphabetical rotation the lot falls on auberon quin an alleged humourist in whom we recognize with the help of mr graham robertsons illustrations a shadowy likeness to mr max beerbohm humour doubtless deteriorates on a throne if king auberon were a real humourist he would not spoil the ripe humour of royalty by devising feeble practical jokes his humour is no laughing matter these imaginary borough councils with their provosts halberdiers banners and flamboyant ceremonial are not nearly so humorous as the real borough councils with their pompous mayors who glory in robes and chains of office not one of these visionary cities is so absurd as that actual city of westminster which emblazons its pride on the walls of its very lavatories this is a case indeed in which truth is funnier than fiction rich as is the humour of the borough councils there is something which is richer stillthe humour of the lord mayor and the city aldermen the incomparable humour of gog and magog not until adam wayne enters does mr chesterton reach the true realm of farce the conception of a man possessed by a devouring passion for notting hill is really farcical and the battles between the patriots of pump street and the municipal reformers who desire to annex it are full of that mockillusion that sham gravity which is the attribute of farce the kings dispatches as war correspondent of the court journal are capital fooling and the burlesque of the style of the late g w steevens is very amusing the gas and water strategy of the napoleon of notting hill is deliciously farcical like all empires notting hill is sapped by success its decline and fall lead to a philosophic dialogue between the sham king and the sham napoleon which lifts the farce into the higher region of irony   suppose i am god said the voice  and suppose i made the world in idleness suppose the stare that you think eternal are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy suppose the sun and the moonare only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant opened alternately in a neverending winksuppose t am god and having made things laugh at them   and suppose i am man answered the other and suppose that i give the answer that shatters even a laugh suppose i do not laugh back at you do not blaspheme you do not curse you but suppose standing up straight under the sky with every power of my being i thank you for the fools paradise you have made suppose i praise you with a literal pain of ecstasy for the jest that has brought me so terrible a joyi ask you in the name of heaven who wins  this passage certainly comes near to being absolute humour it propounds a kind of spiritual pantagruelism as an answer to the irony of an ironic god the idea of course is not new it is as old as the hillsor as the athenaum for more than a quarter of a century ago it was put forward in our columns  the humouristis so perpetually overwhelmed by the irony of the entire game cosmic and human from the droll little conventions of the village pothouse to those of london of paris of new york of pekinup to the apparently meaningless dance of the planets round the sunup again to that greater and more meaningless waltz of suns around the centrehe is so delighted with the delicious foolishness of wisdom the conceited ignorance of knowledge the grotesqueness even of the standard of beauty itselfso overwhelmed is the humourist with the whim of all thiswith the incongruity that isof the normal itselfwith the almightyjoke of the cosmos as it isthat he sees nothing  funny  in departures from laws which to him are in themselves the very quintessence of fun and he laughs the laugh of rabelais and of sterne  for he feels that behind this rich incongruous show there must be a beneficent showman he knows that although at the top of the constellations sits circumstance harlequin and king bowelless and blind shaking his starry cap and bells there sits far above even harlequin himself another being greater than hea being who because he has given us the delight of laughter must be good and who in the end will somewhere set all these incongruities right mr chesterton does not see higher than the harlequin god he does not see the  beneficent showman but he does see that in the ideal man the humourist and the idealist are two lobes of the same brain he finds this ideal man like tolstoy in the ploughmanthe common man whom mere geniuses like you and me can only worship like a god but does the common man really see the ridiculous as the sublime and the sublime as the ridiculous  if so the world is peopled with chestertons and infinitely more amusing than many of us find it the book is at any rate evidence that mr chesterton might do capital work in fiction if he would take adequate time and trouble  for his narrative moves easily and he has an immense romantic gusto,novel_contra

paul faber surgeon paul faber surgeon by george macdonald lld 3 vols london hurst and blackett mr macdonald belongs to the  nocturne  school of novel writers the word  novel as applied to any of mr macdonalds writings is a decided misnomer a book of sermons would be the more appropriate title as all his works are really such under an extremely thin guise he is a tautologist of a very high order indeed few authors are able to retain their popularity as he has done while incessantly reiterating with painful monotony the selfsame ideas as those which appeared in their first production perhaps the fact of different characters in different circumstances giving utterance to mr macdonalds religious profundities may explain this anomaly  paul faber  is even more wearisome than some of its predecessors all the characters having a strange tendency to preach as only mr macdonalds creations can preach which is saying much for their longwindedness the scene of the novel is the cathedral town of glaston the principal surgeon of whichpaul faberis the hero when a student pauls fancy had been entangled with a girl on whom an operation was being performed although occupying an inferior position in the social scale she had under pauls guidance acquired the polish and habits of polite society as time went on paul gradually began to cool and the birth of a little girl brought about a cessation of his visits cold letters taking their stead one day the girl and her baby disappeared and the story opens with paul at glaston where notwithstanding his pronounced atheism he is a popular man he obtrudes his obnoxious views upon everybody but his tender sympathies and desire to alleviate the misery of those around him counterbalance the ill opinion which most people had formed of him juliet meredith the heroine of whose antecedents nothing is known save by herself is lying dangerously ill and faber saves her life by opening one of his veins and injecting some of his own blood into her faber makes love to her but she keeps him in a state of suspense for some inscrutable reason till well on in the second volume meantime faber uses his influence with wingfold the curate to procure her work as a teacher but upon it being discovered that drake a superannuated dissenting minister is in difficulties the curate wishing to assist him in a delicate way proposes that juliet should board with drake which is agreed upon this drake had been minister of a local chapel but was compelled to resign through those bickerings so indigenous to small churches his family consisted of his daughter dorothy and an adopted child amanda whom he had picked up at some sort of creche in southwark drake after experiencing the sore strange ways of poverty suddenly acquires riches which he at once sets about spending nobly soon after this event juliet returns to her former lodgings where faber continues his solicitations which consist mostly of negative arguments against her religious beliefs at last glaston is surprised by the marriage of thc doctor aud miss meredith life was begiuning to grow luther monotonous for mrs faber and full of this feeling she wandered out one day in her husbands absence in passing the drapers shop a strange woman came out whose face mysteriously called up the past a little farther on she met mrs wingfold who insisted that juliet should accompany her on a visit to the rectors wife a storm came on and mrs faber was forced to remain overnight at the rectors next day being sunday she forgot fabers teachings for the nonce and accompanied the others to an adjoining chapel where the curate preached a sermon which coupled wtith the mysterious face of the previous day moved juliet strangely on coming home she  whispered three awful words  into her husbands ear regarding her past life he instantly casts her from him and in vain juliet bares her back aud holds up a whip to be punished  she disappears and the rumour spreads that she has drowned herself but she was really saved from doing so by dorothy drake who secretes her in osterfield park the new house which dorothys father had bought the day following her disappearance faber falls from his horse in a mad chase to find her he gets better but all his old strength of character and selfconfidence have fled at this juncture he recognises by the peculiar formation of her ear that amanda drake is his daughter and upon revealing the fact to old drake he learns that her mother the girl whom he had known in his student days was dead gradually it dawns upon faber that he has been too hard upon his wife considering his own sinful past his wife is about to be confined and by a stratagem on the part of dorothy drake he is brought to the place where his wife is in hiding the room is so skilfully darkened that he fails to recognise her and a second time he saves her life by opening one of his veins he latterly and by slow degrees discovers the truth and the stereotyped reconcilement takes place such is a brief rtsum of this most recent work of mr macdonald it is full of defects that would scarcely be pardonable in a tyro but it sparkles here and there with genuine power mr macdonald is too analytical and talks too much shop for he evidently cannot forget that he was once a minister it is preposterous to imagine that living men and women would talk as mr macdonald makes them do in his books one polwarth and his niece ruthtwo supernumerary charactersare very miracles in this respect talking of heaven liked winged angels this religious twaddlefor wc can call it nothing elsehas not a healthy tendency  it develops that effeminacy which apes at being a washedout likeness of one whose name we reverence too much to mention lightly we always keep men at arms length who wear long hair parted in the centre and who have a faraway sentimental look on their face it may be urged that mr macdonald is paradoxical with a view to giving greater emphasis to the truth  but it is possible to have just a little too much paradox all writers have their idiosyncracies and mr macdonald has his full share the irrepressible solitary horseman  style of g p r james finds a distinct echo in most of mr macdonalds writings occasionally mr macdonald breaks out into melodysave the mark and only in two instances with mediocre ability at page 34 in vol il in the lines beginning  my morning rose in laughter and in the  year song at page 140 vol iii he affects the quaintness of george herbert with but sorry success coleridge once asked lamb if he had ever heard him preach and lamb replied in his genial stuttering way that he had never heard him do anything else mr macdonald can draw a beautiful moral from this these three volumes  drag their fdow length along  with a wearisome tediousness enlivened here and there with a sermon in toto as delivered by the curate it is to be hoped that next time mr macdonald attempts to entertain the public it will be in a way worthy of that skill which he undoubtedly possesses,novel_contra
the history and pleasant chronicle of little jehan de smeure and the lady of the fair cousins without being otherwise named now first done into english by alexander vance dublin moffat  co this ie another of mr vances translations from the old french chronicles he is a man with a hobby and wishes to induce as many readen aa possible to share his enthusiasm the chronicle is well rendered into english with judicious omissions but the racy fun whioh exists in the original evaporates in the translation and the chronicle itself is heavy it is a scandalous chronicle about the  lady of the fair cousins who first falls in love with a little cherubino of a page and not only instructs him in the whole duty of a courteous gentleman but also supplies him with money to boy fine clothes which in those lays were even more coveted than at present telling him to say his mother had sent them after he has become a noble knight and been her faithful adorer for many yean she disgracefully throws him off and becomes the paramour of a stalwart abbot and they both seek to turn the sieur de saintre into ridicule but he exacts such heavy revenge as makes one feel that the usage in those days was very rough both in peace and war we suspect this very chronicle was written as a further punishment to the lady jehan de saintre died in 1458 and the lady is supposed to have been marie daughter of king john who fought the battle of poictien and widow of alphonse of arragon duke de bar if this chronicle be a specimen of the novels of that period we are better off in that respect at least the book is like reading an old illuminated ms and has the interest of being a curiosity but we do not find it otherwise tl entertaining   the literary examiner the histoy and pleasant chronicle of little jehan

little jehan de saintre as  the first novel in  the conventional and modem acceptation of the term of which there is any record originating either in france or in england it is certainly  pleasant  enough to entertain any novelreader of the present day written by one antoine de la salles in the year 1459 its sene is laid in the previous century little jehan the hero is a page of honour to king john the second of france so comely and graceful that at the age of thirteen he has won the favour of every one at court and most of all of the lady of the fair cousins a young widow of great beauty and as times go of modesty as great resolved never again to marry she has refused many a splendid offer but the gentle bearing of the little page has warmed her heart and she resolves that she will make his fortune therefore she often entices him to her side and the more she sees of him the more she likes him par amrur she warns him by sundry exhortations and examples of the way in which he is to flee the seven deadly sins to obey the ten commandments to adhere to the twelve articles of faith to pursue the seven cardinal virtues and in all other respects to deserve the name of true knight and true lover such an one she says is the most honourable of men when he is at mass he is  most devout at table the best conducted in the company of lords and ladies the most accomplished  with his ears he will never so much as hear an indelicate word nor will he allow his eyes an indiscreet regard nor from his lips an unhandsome word to escape with his hands he will not venture on dishonest liberties nor with his feet wander into forbidden quarters no other  will be equipped like him as for his armour it will be of the best and after the latest ordinance he will be well mounted and have his caparisons of the richest and for the love of his lady will ever be in the foremost a of the fight such an one the lady of the fair cousins wl     would have little jehan become and on his swearing fealty to her she proceeds to train him for all knightly service she provides him with fine clothing with armour and with equipage she so commends him to the favour of the king and queen that in due time he is promoted from being a page to the rank of trencher squire and after that he is sent abroad to do valiant deeds till coming home successful he is knighted with all honour in dance and in tournament at courtly festival and on the field of battle he acquits himself alike and in devotion to the lady whose love has brought all this about he gives of his knightly worth the greatest proof of all but according to custom their attachment is kept secret when she desires to speak to him she picks her teeth with her bodkin until he acknowledges the signal by rubbing his right eye with his finger or when he has anything to say to her he summons her in like manner and then they meet at night in a passage or in a meadow during his absence she wears no linen next her flesh on fridays and saturdays and as often as she thinks him to be in danger or hears of his success sbe throws herself on her naked knees in prayer or in thanksgiving but of these things not even her own maidens know a word so matters stand for some years at length little jehannow the lord de saintreplans a wonderful course of adventure which will take him all over the world and if he prospers get him endless fame it is so perilous that the king thinks long before sanctioning the enterprise and the lady grieves too much to sanction it at all saintr6s honour is at stake however and though miserable and sick at heart he goesthe king and the queen watching him in their night shirts from the palacewindow and the lady of the fair cousins sorrowing almost to death at the end of three years he returns laden with honours to receive from king and courtiers the praise that is his due but there is no praise from her whose praise he esteems above all other he finds that the lady of the fair cousins at first passionately afflicted at his departure left the court to spend the time in solitude but falling in with an evilminded abbot broke through all rules of womanly duty and v so acted that by one of the ladies in the service of the i queen it is even hinted that she should be stripped c  naked from her head to her hips her head shaved and when fat and sugar had been well rubbed into her turned up for the entertainment of the town and the benefit of the midges and the flies that doom is not enforced conscience brings punishment enough to the evildoer and as for the lord de saintre ho applied himself so steadfastly to deeds of chivalry that he dies  the most valiant knight of all the realm of france such in very brief is the story of the novel which mr vancewho has already shown in his selection and rendering of romantic episodes of chivalric and mediaval france how well ho is able to reproduce the thought and represent the life of faroff timeshas translated with admirable taste and power he has selected the work and diligently applied himself to it not only for the sake of introdiucing to modern readers an antiquarian curiosity the favourite of sir walter scott and by remotest possibility originator of the thought out of whice  waverley sprang not only because in it are to be found merits of construction  entitling it to be called  the i waverley and even more  than the  waverley of a comparatively unlettered age and decided merits of description satirical and humorous but chiefly for the sake of aiding in the correction of some popular views concerning mediaeval society here says mr vance rwe have a man at a time when every forest was the haunt of fays when every dungeon had its dragon den its giant court its dwarf when hermits palmers wept recluses prayed when every lady had her milkwhite palfrey unprotected female her champion damsel her lover virgin her ravisher or deliverer when every castle was enchanted the very stones were bewitched in a word when all kindred and contemporary literature was no better or other than one interminable and unintelligible rigmarole ofhow 1 ever picturesque and solemnclumsy and unmanageable adventure boldly discarding at a swoop all such auxiliaries fearlessly retreating upon nature pure simple 1 unadulterate the book is as full of raillery though i more concealed at the mediaeval taste for romantic literature as was chaucers earlier rhyme of sir thopas or even t cervantess later production of i don quixote but much  more than this like the works of chaucer and every other sensible writer of those daysand the knight of the tower whose book for the instructia of his daughters is t in part translated by mr vance was a very sensible writer t it shows that notwithstanding all the bombast of knightly enterprise and all the extravagance of minstrels lays not v withstanding all outside diversities of manner and appearance the realities of thought and life were in the middle ages not so very different from the thought and life of shakespeares day of fieldings or of our own common sense forbids us to believe in the magic that often occurs in the literature of those early times should not

present generation i mean any more than that the persons for whom it was fi written found amusement in the grotesque sentimental d presentment of vice which in their own conduct theydb would shun be 5 the severe judgement passed upon the lady of the fair g cousins for her conduct is an evidence of the condemnation r heaped in the fourteenth century as in every other by all r but the most abandoned

constance herbert by geraldine e jfwsbuuy 3 vols london  hurst and blackett 1855 it seldom falls to our lot to take up a novel in which the writer has contrived to engage and interest the feelings of the readers more completely than in the one now before us miss jewsbury the authoress has in the present instance dealt somewhat largely in madness and sudden death and the rewards bestowed upon the virtuous appear rather meagre when contrasted with the punishments allotted to the wicked nevertheless the general feeling which is likely to result from the perusal of so many terriblo events is not one calculated to leave a morbid impression upon the mind since the 44 morale  of the book is sound and the chances are that most persons would return to the history of their own lives with increased satisfaction after contemplating upon paper so much wholesale miser in the second volume we have a glimpse of aunt margaret endeavouring to console the heroine constance herbert in the midst of a terrific affliction by reciting to her the still greater woes encountered by herself in earlier days we presume on the principle of larochefoucauld who tells us 44that in the misfortunes even of our best friends there is something not altogether displeasing to us at the conclusion of the aunts story the heroine with great naivete is made to express her astonishment that people ever should succeed in living to the age of eighty  indeed we fully under such circumstances agree with the heroine in her doubts and can suggest no moro practical expedient for struggling through such a weight of calamity than a box of parrs life pills the male characters in this book are by no meads pleasing specimens of the  genus homo charles herbert the father of the heroine who turns out eventually a wretch possesses in his early life a degree of credulity and trustfulness that is quite refreshing in these days of doubt and scepticism for instance he falls in love with though daughter of  a respectable yeoman who is a refined superior young woman failing to obtain the parents consent to the marriage be departs for india where shortly after his father informs him in a letter of kate hathertons the superior young womans marriage with somebody else the way hi which the news is received by charles herbert we give in the authors own words  charles herbert suffered keenly after this destruction of his hopes but he knew kate hatherton better than his father did and his faith in her was not shaken by her marriage with another man and his affection for her continued as strong as ever on his return home after a lapse of years he finds his ladyelove a widow the meeting is accidental and unexpected he greets her in the following style   kate my kate they grasped each others hands and it was as though they had never parted in the mean time that matters may be complete he has proposed to another lady miss wilmot who has given him her affections and fixed the wedding day this little affair does not appear to give him much uneasiness having as he tells us acquainted miss wilmot of his early attachment he irnagines that now that he has not only found his kate but found her free it does not appear that he over exerted himself in his 6earch miss wilmot is to resign him as a matter of course the abrupt manner in which he acquaints her of this rather startling change in her destiny we quote from the volume before us 441 am come to ask you to dissolve our engagement since this morning i have seen kate hatherton whom i never thought to see in this world again i give you my honour i did not seek her i did not know even that i still loved her till she stood before me in that place you left me this morning i cannot see what good it would do you to marry me knowing what you do for i told you all that kate hatherton had been to me and i tell you now all that she is thero would be no honour if i kept my engagement when the first sight of her made me forget youand myself too if i had been conscious of the hold she had over me i would never have spoken a word to you or to any other woman but it is too late to go into all that now 44 then were you quite indifferent about me  did you never caro for me   gasped miss wilmot 441 tell you sarah that i did not know my own heart i was not indifferent to you i cared for you more than any other woman i ever sawexcept one i loved her before i loved you and i shall love her till i die it is because you are a good woman and because you were my friend before i ever thought of you as my wife that i ara come in this way and because i thought you would see and feel how all this bas befallen miss wilmot sat completely stupefied with the weight and suddenness of the blow that had come upon her but in all wounds the great suffering does not follow immediately and she waa astonished to find how little pain she felt after a dull pause during which she pulled off the riug he had given her when they became engaged she said 44 you are free charlesquite free here is your ring again will you tell my uncle or shall i   44let me tell him said charles 44 and then if he thinks it needful to blow out ray brains he can 41 he will scarcely feel called upon to do that replied miss wilmot with a slight bitterness  charles herbert looked at her for the first time since the interview had begun his eyes had certainly rested upon her but without any personal consciousness that he saw ber sarah i hope with all my soul that i have been a coxcomb and that you do not really care for roe so much as i allowed myself to fancy you will get over it and no one who knows you can believe you to have been slighted a spasm of painful indignation passed across miss wilmots face  charles herbert said she rising  it is because i love yon it is because i was your friend before i was your affianced wife it is because i understand your nature better than any one else in the world is likely to do that i do not blame you for what you have done this day now leave me there is nothing more to say between us in this scene the authoress shows a knowledge of human nature miss wilmots mind is wholly unprepared to receive this cruel intelligence contrary therefore to the usual practice of authors in such cases there is neither immediate fainting nor hysterics but afterwards when her mind has digested all that has taken place she suffers severely enough there are other passages in this book that we might have selected showing the dramatic powers of the authoress to perhaps greater advantage but we abstain from quoting them for fear of diminishing the interest of the story we shall therefore limit ourselves to saying how heartily we concur in the sentiment uttered by aunt margaret  who says the more ones life resembles a novel the more uncomfortable it is and we feel we cannot too strongly recommend our friends to be cautious how they let their lives resemble this one if they can by any means avoid

  sister louise sister louise or thc story of a womans repentance by g j why temelville london  chapman and hall it is pleasant to be disappointed in a book that opens in the most approved style of the historical novel with a dialogue between two soldier friends in the low countries two hundred years ago  who call each other comrade dash dowtn a plumed hat toss oft a stoup of wine and have a faroff memory in their deep grey eyes and for this reason because the vividness of the local colouring though safety in the application of it and the tinsel of the dummy royalties that crowd the canvas make a novel whose scene is remote in time and country the citadel of ignorant and shallow writers and though fools paradise of those vacuous gapers who must have blazonry and bunting even in what they read and so  i faith and  byre ladye  do duty for dialogue  and a surface of pomp and circumstance ostentation and affectation pass themselves off as the workings of human nature on that large class who have either never felt or never analysed their feelings but when an author who has some instinctive insight into though machinery of thc heart and who writes besides with that  easy grace and selfrestrained strength which is the sure token of a gentleman of culture and a man of the world selects a certain century to frame his picture in it is the picture and not the frame that we observe and his manipulation of accessories that are unfamiliar to us makes us either admire his skill the more or possibly regret that the strangeness of the surroundings distracts and distorts our view of the characters conspicuous instances of this are  romola and those novels of scott which are chiefly historical surely it is always in spite of and not because of their pecuharity that we praise those books and it is because in  sister louise an honest development of characters wrought with no little skill and delicacy outshines its setting of upholstering gorgeousness that we say it is a good book worth writing and worth reading an outline of the story is briefly this louise de la valliere and athenee de mortemar are two girls well born and straitly bred who become maids of honour at the court of the youthful and beautiful louis quatorze with the strictest propriety wre are told how they both of them ceased in any sense of the word to deserve that designation louise has a devoted lover the marquis de bragelone he of the faroff eyes athenee has a dashing admirer henri le blanc the brother of louise and these two gentlemen complicate themselves in fruitless rivalry with the king to whose attractions both ladies but for different reasons succumb each retiring at the close of his reignlouise to the selftormenting repentance of a convent where she dies and athenee to the seclusion of displacement and disgust where she passes from our view  and the widow scarron madame de maintenon reigns in her stead the person and character of the heroine louise are carefully and we should imagine truly drawn  soft blue eyes and tender quivering mouth delicate rather than regular of features a face of which the primrose is the type among flowers and the pearl among precious stones her figure was well formed and agile though hampered by a limp in afterlife rivals declared she was lame and denied she was beautiful but the very vehemence of their criticism offers its best contradiction    her nature was one of entire selfdevotion totally irrespective of self in striking contrast to her stands out the saucy and unscrupulous athenee who loves the king designedly and not because she cannot help it supplants her early friend jilts her first lover is worldly to the backbone and yet not without shallow qualms of temporary contrition nor without that intermittent breath of a better affection which blows hot and cold in so many shallow women there is great sameness in love affairs says this roue of twenty one man pleases more than another and that is all and so for a vantageground she marries the rich monsieur de montespan and keeps a line to hold her former lover weaving her net round the king all the while louise on the other hand is a tender and true woman all sensitiveness and selfabnegation  every sense and instinct of nature and romance held in thrall by youthful kinghood and worshipping with idolatry a thoroughly selfish man  simply because something must be offered up there is something very touching in the story of her love and how it slowly palls upon the king and how she falls from disappointment to despair till remorse and a broken heart beat themselves away in an ascetic infatuation and the king the petted and pampered the favourite of gods and men following his better instincts in trying to love her notwithstanding the boredom which grows upon him all the more because of her utter resignation of all her personality to him he too is painted with truth and not without force but there is an uneasiness about any character that is half fact and half fiction still it is work worthy of an artist to trace the course of such a love as his  whose gradations are slow and sure custom indifference weariness and neglect he is princely according to the popular idea of kinghood in magnificence in assumption of omnipotence in graceful treading on the necks of men  he wages battle under the eyes of ladies and in full dress but indeed it is not so difficult to draw something that will pass muster for a character if you put it on a pedestal saying  this is a great king and the millinery is a la louis quatorze to reveal what detail of plot there is would be hardly fair for there is very little and the book does not depend upon its plot and is all the more readable for the simplicity of it the description of the hunt is good or it would not have been written by the author of  katerfelto the conversations are terse and witty and smack very strongly of the french the opening scene in the low countries is superfluous  and the whole of the last book which is an enlargement on the penances of  louise de la misericorde might have been curtailed with advantage but even as it is the story is commendably short nor is there a weak sentence throughout nor one that jars upon the taste even the magnificence is not tawdrily described the book is natural notwithstanding its setting and is obviously written by a gentleman the sentences are occasionally very long but they never seem longwinded it is true that we meet with many familiar commonplaces in an elegant disguise and that many a harmless sentiment stalks by us with an unwonted dignity but it is none the less a pleasure and not a common one to meet with a story not very long and not very pretentious temperately and smoothly told where there is nothing of strain or vulgarity or rant no stilts and no crimes except adultery  no horrors and no vapours of course there is much that might be quarrelled with is it true as is here laid down that when a man and a woman carry a sorrow between them the man displays and the woman feels it the most  is it true that there is a sinking of the heart which never deceives and is surely followed by evil  it is rather that the shadow of the present throws itself back into the past but assertions like these not being written by one of the great masters of mental analysis are harmless enough and were possibly not intended as deliberate conclusions on the other hand the book abounds in aphorisms and epigrammatic bits of description here is one which if it is original is too good not to be quoted  the princess henriette was just enough of a stuart to see clearly the one side of a question to ignore the other and to defy the consequences of the whole a book that is short natural and interesting is worth reading,novel_contra

lives of the  minister the doctor and the farmer of that sequestered vale we warn however those of our readers who have destroyed their intellectual digestion by a course of the highlyspiced fictionof

are here entirely gagtiug the encliantments of society crimes and criminals nlystenes and mystifications plots and counterplots are all conspicuous by their absence the actors in the little interlude which the author puts so pleasantly before us are few in number but they play their parts with rare fidelity to nature and consequently rivet our attention more and more closely as we proceed we find too some pretty sketches of scenery and are occasionally carried away bodily to the land of brown heath and shiggy wood we wander with the author through the golden gorse or sit at his command on a

pensive musings on the vanity of human wishes the foolishness of man and the perversity of woman are occasionally relieved by some touches of grim humour which are the more effective from the strong shadows by which they are surrounded some of old johns theological difficulties are very well related when he is told that his master the minister has lost all his fortune by the failure of a company he breaks out  i ken its the lord giveth im no thinkin its him wha taks awa for why at a wad he gie it then  its o the deil doctar maister im certain shure ot ye ken hoo he plagit puir job aforetime

under the crags which pineclad abruptly rise and overshadow its little bit of lawn and privetset shrubbery at early morning the sun strikes full on it gilding and softening each rocky prominence above giving warmth to the lowxlyilg house and splendour to its whitewashed walls heating also tile pineroots in the fissures of the rocks where the scantiness of the gravelly soil makes it a wonder that trees should grow at all and as befits the hardness and poverty in which they are rooted the pines show no grace of outline no beauty of colouring they are dark of hue and often deformed and their odour is sharp and acrid yet they are the gladness and beauty of the cliffs to which they give a grace and softness such as no gaudy colouring could bestow such as no regularity of stem or foliage could impart while still it is early evening the western crags with their pincdeepened shadows cast the manse and its environings into gloom and gradually the shadows stream over the valley as far as the rivers western banik creep over the river too and out over the slain beyond as the daiy wanes the site is pictures cue suitable to foster an imagination full of conflicting fancies i yet apart

enchanting as bessie and at the same time more highly educated and better fitted to become the wife of a professional man one young lady in particular endeavours to win him away from his love by the magic of music and the potent spells of beauty and wit she almost succeeds and makes the doctor for a tinie a miserable man we will not however spoil the pleasure of readers of the novel by relating all the incidents of this charming idyl the interest centres around the characters we have named though there are some minor personages who are very naturally portraiyed such are the flighty miss robison the timid bessies friend and counsellor the rev gabriel bowie a probationer of the kirk of gaunt frame and prodigious appetite and last but not least sir james fanflare a scottish edition of

a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur

which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample of a young

existence in his companion the youngpainter john james tidley mrthackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin the application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to truth with a smile or a wink to fashion in the same moment  praising pilgrim and faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in nuditty fair the chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 vol i p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us there is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in the newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as the kickleburys fur instance which the times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination,novel_contra

of whllat he does and has set himself at llawtlhoriis feet with the entire trust and adniiriation which we may suppose to have been exhibited formerly by the pupils in the school of a great and original painter he has his reward too for he has caught much more than the mere trick of style by no means difficult to imitate and has succeeded more nearly than any other writer we have met in entering into hawthornes psychology with its half morbid and entirely weird conception of life we incline to think  the madonna of the future  the most artistic of his tales though that which gives the title to his book is most fully worked out and is very subtle in treatment recalling here andi there the  septimius  of his model there is one blot in the book the material ghastli ness of the endingof one story the romance of certain old clothes which is more like poe than hawthorne and which we think the author will feel on reflection would have gained in impressiveness by the omission of the last detail and the substitution of a mere look of frozen terror on the dead face the incident as it stands mars the whole conception of perdita with which it is entirely out of keeping eglantine makes no advance but rather retrogression in its authors literary work for it is by no means so good a novel as any of its three precursors there are tokens throughout of too much facility in mere production of copy and too little pains in reducing that copy to symmetrical form to say nothing whatever of artistic conscientiousness in detail which is not atoned for by the occasional introduction of clever sentences and paragraphs the story if it may be so called is an autobiographical mono logue with but little interest since the only attempts at special delineation of character depict types which are tediously common in the modern novel such as the gracious and insincere matron of society and the mature young lady who affects gushing childishness and in these days of realistic painting it is not too much to ask even a lady author to be correct in details meant to give local colour and finish the daughter of a great scientific philosopher of wide general learning as the narrator of the story is supposed to be would not again and again cite the differential calculus  as the tremendously abstruse subject which her fathers distinguished visitors habitually discussed with him they would be just as likely to discuss the rule of three nor would she include gibbons english history as forming along with the decline and fall part of the favourite reading of her model coastguardsman at least it was inconsiderate if such were the case not to make the learned mr leslie seize on the book hitherto unknown to bibliography and give it to the reading public which would only too gladly welcome such a discovery it may be carpingly minute criticism to say that the st bees hood which the model broad church parson of the book wears and of which the author who attempts dutch painting makes a good deal is not purple but a wonderful combination of red and white but that a writer wlio has evidently a turn for marketing and cookery with a hearty relish for her victuals should give as a proof of the utter imbecility of her gushing lady that young persons belief that eggs arc or ought to be sold by the pound strikes us as showing very little grasp of the economical bearings of the subject would it surprise her to hear that more than one american legislature has recently enacted that all eggs are henceforth to be sold by the pound and that the average dozen must turn a given weight on the ground that the present system of selling by mere number irrespective of size is unfair to the purchaser and a permanent discouragement to careful breeding since no advantage is now gained in the market by the farmer who brings the finest and heaviest eggs for sale over his competitor who looks to quantity alone several other questions social and religious are settled in the book just as decisively and with exactly the same amount of intelligent understanding as this one and we would cheerfully give all the judgments and the longwinded reasons for their formation in exchange for a little more life and movement in the somewhat wooden puppets of the tale  jocelyns mista7ke derives its interest almost wholly from its central figure which is a very good study of character mrs spender has not sought to devise novel situations for her plot and has contented herself with using materials which have served many authors before but she has employed them better than usual the main situation in the book for example is not very different from that in a once popular story e laiu wyndham yet there is no likeness at all in treatment so that the sense of triteness does not strike the reader mrs spenders english is unusually good and she has learned the art of working her opinions on men and things into the web of her story in stead of merely intercalating homilies after the fashion of too many of her sisters with the certainty of having them skipped by the judicious reader who desires in the emphatic language of a schoolboy uttered in the present critics hearing more story and less jaw the jocelyn of the book is very skilfully drawn an impetuous wilful passionate imaginative woman in whom the perceptive faculties are far more matured than the reflective who feels but does not reason and who is from temperament what frenchmen call tate montee and americans high falutinc in season and out of season the chief success of the book is the manner in which the author conciliates the sympathies of her readers in favour of the very defective heroine and makes them understand how she could win and retain the affections of two men of exceptional mark and power though of different types and that without her having brain enough with all her imagination and fluency to appreciate the best qualities of either one particularly happy touch quite true to nature is that where jocelyn spoils her application for the post of governess by springing on her hobby at a chance word of her proposed employer and delivering a lecture then and there on the development of woman mfore we think might have been made of the contrast between the fiery and courageous heroine and her vacillating brother but where it is brought out at all it is well done finally the toile of the book is entirely high and sound and though it does not belong to the small first rank of novels that will live it rises in type and diction far above the ephemeral stories of the season olt of society is a commonplace and rather dull book written in a style which is alternately fine and slipshod gorgeous in adjectives and hazy in grammar it belongs to the school of transpontine melodrama according to which hardness selfishness and vice are habitual characteristics of those who move or try to move in refined and wealthy circles while generosity and virtue must be souglht among those who are out of society that a life of much ease and little responsibility is unfiavourable to loftiness of aim and energy of action is doubtless true enough but mrs pulleyne must know very little indeed of modern engrland if she imagines that the line can be drawn as she draws it the artisans who refuse to associate with labourers or even to use the same houses of call the shopboys who rob tills to pay gambling debts the working men who correct their wives with iron clogs are on the whole not more admirable citizens than mrs pulleynes aristocrats and are real flesh and blood while her characters despite of the dedication of her book to a lady of princely rank are clearly evolved from a not very vivid imagination and do not by any means convey the impression of being studies from life and personal contact especially as she has not mastered the somewhat intricate system of english titles of rank robert forrcster is the work of a very inexperienced hand and the best counsel for the author is to attempt a play and to put the manuscript into the hands of some practised manager or actor in order to see how much and what would be cut out curiously enough there is a chapter in the book wherein the heroine by her frank criticisms induces a lady friend to give up novelwriting as not possessing the necessary faculty and being unable to see what is expedient in a book meant to win public approval the actual story in robert forester scarcely occupies onefifth of the volume and the remainder is entirely taken up with digressions sometimes on scenery and more often on what the characters could should might ought or would have thought or done while their actual doings are compressible into a very small bulk indeed thus in one chapter of the book two persons engaged to two other persons meet for an avowal of their preference for one another and nearly twelve pages are given to a chapter which immediately follows this whose whole contents consist of the fact that their conversation was overheard by one of the other pair and that she did not like it ten words in the chapter whiich describes the meeting would have been enough and this is just the place where an experienced manager would have ruthlessly cut down the copy were it a play nor are the descriptions of scenery vivid enough to be worth the space they occupy we have three living novelists who can write of scenery so as to delight their readers air black perhaps first mir blackmore a good second and amr george macdonald third though if his admirable poetical vignettes of landscape be taken into

a terrible temptation london saturday august 3 1s71 literature by charles reade t 3 vols chapman  hall every reader of novels is we suppose familiar by this time both with mr reades merits and with his faults we ali know his power of giving interest to a story and holding us bound and unable to lay the book down till we have read to the very end not that we may solve a riddle as is the way with too many novelistshe never keeps the secret till the endbut solely that we may know how everybody is to escape from the difficulties in which he delights to plaoe his characters and that we may enjoy to the full his ingenuity in keeping distinct every thread of the seemingly tangled web of his plots we are in the secret the whole time but the personages of the story are not and it is in their gradual enlightenment not in ours that the interest of mr reades novels lies then again how well we know his gift of the most uncompromisingly hard hitting when he has got hold of a social abuse and that not always in vain  this however does not apply in the present case he has no doubt a little fling at his old foe the private asylum but strange to relate this time the asylum is kept by a doctor who is neither a fool nor a ruffian but an agreeable and somewhat scientific mau for whom mr read evidently has a slight liking we say has a liking advisedly for one of our authors great merits is the personal knowledge so to speak which he always has of his characters of course he sees them through readean spectacles  that is they say and do things which no mortal ever said or did  they insert unnecessary pronouns and auxiliary verbs in conversation and talk in capitals and italics large type and small and so forth  but still they are creatures and not puppets and we feel interested in them and feel too when we have finished the book that we have added to our list of acquaintances having generalised sufficiently we proceed to give a short outline of  a terrible temptation nor shall we thereby interfere with the pleasure of possible readers for as we have said mr reades stories do not depend for their interest on unexpected revelations at the end of th e third volume the story then is as follows there are two cousins of the name of bassett sir charles baronet and richard the father of richard though the elder son and heir to an entailed property has been before the opening of the story compelled in order to pay his debts to sell the reversion to his father the grandfather of the cousins and to join him in cutting off the entail the property and estate of lluntercombe has accordingly descended to the father of sir charles who for political services was made a baronet at the beginning of the story we find the cousins in rivalry for the hand of a beautiful miss arabella bruce she naturally prefers the baronet who though decidedly  fast has besides his title and property a more pleasant disposition than his cousin the latter who has never forgiven the arrangement by which the property was lost to him is further stung to fury by his defeat and casts about to get his revenge fortune favours him so far that he discovers a liaison between sir charles and a certain miss somerset whose position in life may be understood when we say that she lives in a sumptuous house in mayfair is the admiration of duchesses in the park and expresses herself on one occasion thus the words were we believe once really used lucky for you beggars that i am a lady or i would break every dd window in the house  and the introduction of this person reminds us of a fault of mr reades which we cannot pass over in silence such things arenor do wo so much object to their use for purposes of fiction though we think he has dwelled unnecessarily on miss somerset and given us a little too much of the private life of the demimonde  but we must regret the want of reticence which he shows in alluding in other places to matters which are usually passed over lightly by most modern masters of at least english fiction we do not point out the passages for fear of laying ourselves open to a similar reproach but again we say we regret it for it renders it absolutely impossible for us to put this book with all its merits into the hands say of our unmarried sisters to resume the story richard bassett by means of an anonymous letter succeeds in breaking off the match for a time at a moment too when sir charles has just severed at some expense to himself the ties which bound him to the lady of doubtful reputation and has made up his mind to live as an homme range the lovers are in despair but the truth comes out through the intervention of miss somerset herself and they are at length married richards malice pursues them however he annoys sir charles by every means small and great in his power saves money and buys small farms bordering on his cousins estate shoots his pheasants prosecutes him unsuccessfully for a libel and ultimately succeeds in getting him shut up in the asylum to which we have already alluded now appears the dens ex machind without whom no novel of mr reades would be complete whom we already know under the guise of dr sampson martin wittenhaagen dr amboyne and others  the person of rough exterior and rude manners but possessed of a ready invention and an inexhaustible willingness to use it in the service of his neighbours in the present instance it is one mr rolfe a novelist who knows everybody and all about them and who undertakes the job con amore meanwhile lady bassett has yielded to the terrible temptation which gives its name to the book they have been married some years and she is still childless she perceives and is made wretched by perceiving her husbands mortification and goaded by the fear of losing his affection she contrives with the assistance of her maid to deceive him and the world by a pretended confinement and to pass off another womans child as her own this maid is the sister of rhoda somerset the former mistress of sir charles and has by a series of chances directed more or less by richard bassett who is enamoured of her come into the service of lady bassett the supposititious heir is her illegitimate son by richard by the time the deception is complete sir charles has been freed from the asylum and returns home delighted at having at last an heir the remainder of the story is occupied with lady bassetts perplexities and miseries arising from her fault through which we will not take our readers it will be sufficient to say that richard suspects something of the truth that sir charles is not the father of the boy but is on an entirely wrong scent that children are born bond fide to the baronet and his wife that our former acquaintance miss somerset turns up again married respectably and with a turn for preaching like a famous predecessor of hers in real life that circumstances render it necessary for lady bassett to confess her fault at the moment when richard thinks he has played his masterstroke of revenge and that a reconciliation between the cousins cemented by though marriage of sir charless real heir to richards daughter ends the book the story as we have said is told with all mr reades power and we may add with nearly all his usual eccentricity of style we do not think on the whole that we should like to see him alter this for without it he would not be the charles read that we know but we hope no one else will imitate it for what is tolerable chiefly by reason of its originality would be an intolerable affectation if not original one question wc should like to ask before concluding where in the world did mr read get hold of the lunatics invention of the  airloom of which he even reproduces the diagram  after reading it we feel almost mad ourselves it produces the same effect upon us as does an hours conversation with a person whose mind is deranged and we can only say that if mr read evolved it from his own consciousness he possesses to a most extraordinary degree the power of mentally  putting himself in the place  of the character whom he desires to depict  new novels 1 terrible temptation a story of the day by charles reade in three volumes chapman and hall mr reades usual way of novelwriting is almost too well known to need criticising if he will be good enough to break new ground again as he did once and with excellent result in  the cloister and the hearth he will certainly produce a work calling for lengthy comment and one that we may be pretty sure will call for hearty praise we do not say that  a terrible temptation does not deserve praise but there is hardly anything more to be said about it than has been said about his earlier  stories of the day if it is not quite as much of a novel with a purpose  as some others it is quite as realistic quite as j clever and quite as irritating no one wdio reads the first  chapter of one of his tales can abstain from reading on to  the end  but when we have read the book through we j feel that we have been dragged through a dissecting room i and forced to look at a ghastly array of diseased limbs i listening all the time to an anatomical lecture that i3 quite true but by no means amusing mr read is a social anatomist of great power and he generally makes it his business to discourse about social diseases that is a good thing to do now and then at any rate and even through novels if by novels the public can be most influenced but he who does it should never forget that in exposing the diseases his duty is to show how they may be avoided mr read does sometimes forget this and he has forgotten it especially in a terrible temptation this novel has no moral at all unless its purpose be to prove that lying is sometimes a good thing and that wives ought sometimes to deceive their husbands unless we except a mad doctor who has not much to do with the story and a boy and girl who are brought in merely to untie the knot which the author has made every person in this novel is disagreeable the plot of the novel is also disagreeable it begins and continues in hatred malice and all uncharitableness and if it does not end therewith this group of vices is only withdrawn to make room for exemplification of the novel doctrine that dishonesty is the best policy at any rate in the case of wives whose husbands smoke so much as to interfere with the development of species the husband who thus errs is sir charles bassett a rich man who falls in love after the ordinary amount of dissipation and who marries the object of his affections after considerable difficulties the author of these difficulties is his cousin richard bassett who thinks that he has been defrauded of the family possessions and who is accordingly very anxious to get them back or at any rate to secure their descent to his son when he gets one he not only wants sir charles not to marry but would like to be himself the husband of the lady of sir charless choice therefore he brings to light and shows in false colours a liaison between sir charles and a fashionable prostitute whose ways and dispositions are described with remarkable precision and who in due time is converted and brought forward as a very successful openair preacher sir charles bassett however breaks through the snare set for him by his wicked cousin and the wicked cousin has to lay other snares which provide much of the material of the novel it is to counteract them and one of them in particular that sir charles bassetts wife yields to  a terrible temptation having no child of her own she pretends to have one and by an ingenious contrivance of the authors the baby she adopts is an illegitimate child of richard bassetts the advantages of that contrivance are evident it gives a subtle charm to the working out of richard bassetts schemes for the injuring of his own son and when that son grows up and proves an utterly worthless fellow it gives wonderful point to a scene which might have been written for the melodramatic stage in which richard bassett having with a refinement of cruelty planned that sir charles shall send his own son to trial for housebreaking discovers that he and not his cousin is the boys father we need not tell more of mr reades plot or name more of his characters that those characters are skilfully described need not be said but if they are natural they are graceless whether they sin much or little they sin on to the end and the only reflection to be drawn from their careers is that sin if rather ugly and troublesome works its own cure when sir charles bassett having reduced his daily allowance of cigars lady bassett has a son of her own she continues to deceive her husband about the reputed heir on very frivolous grounds and she deceives him to the end her virtue being thereby apparently enhanced though it is true that she is not represented as being quite as virtuous as the sometime courtesan who becomes a streetpreacher we should have been grateful to mr read had he really attacked some of the false conventionalities of the day and shown that true morality may be very different from the morality of either pulpit or drawingroom ethics but  a terrible temptation does not show that it only shows once again that mr read is a very clever writer,novel_contra

sylvie and bruno by lewis carroll mac millan  co a book of which the keynote is topsyturvyness ought surely to be produced in a somewhat topsyturvy manner so it is not surprising to find from mr lewis carrolls preface that he first collected his incidents and dialogues or fragments of them and then invented a story to use these to the best advantage he reveals in fact in his preface his method of composition the chapters headed fairy sylvie and brunos revenge  are with some slight alterations reprinted from a tale in aunt judys magazine 1867 not till seven years after itt publication did the idea of making it the nucleus of a longer story present itself te the authors mind as the years went on writes mr carroll i jotted down at odd moments all sorts of odd ideas and fragments of dialogue that occurred to mewho knows how with a transitory suddenness that left me no choice but either to record them then and there or te abandon them to oblivionand thus it came to pass that i found myself at last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litteratureif the reader will kindly excuse the spellingwhick only needed stringing together upon the threat of a consecutive story to constitute the book i hoped to write only  the task at first seemed absolutely hopeless and gave me a far clearer idea than i ever had before of the meaning of the word  chaos and i think it must have been ten years or more before i had succeeded in classifying these oddsandends sufficiently to see what sort of a story they indicated  for the story had to grow out of the incidents not the incidents out of the story such was the  genesis of  sylvie and bruno being written by mr lewis carroll it is needless to say that it is full of amusing things and not without some of  the graver thoughts of human life nevertheless it falls far below  alice in wonderland and the illustrations of mr harry furniss are by northeast means worthy of his reputation the narrator is an impersonal being who comes and goes like miss meadows and the girls in  uncle remus and never takes much more shape he lapses into fairyland every time he falls asleep and returns without any sense of strangeness and so well is this managed that we accompany him thither with perfect ease and are quite as able to make the best of both worlds as he is the characters ara numerous there is a warden who is deposed from his wardenship and finds refuge in fairyland as kinga subwarden with a wicked and very stout wife who  looks like a haystack out of tempera distinguished doctor who has  actually invented three new diseases besides a near way of breaking your collarbone he j wean boots specially made for horizontal weather and is so clever that  sometimes he says things that nobody can understand there is another professor who lectures with his back turned to the audience and a gardener who breaks out into snatches of song which have the old ring he thought he saw an elephant that practised on the fife  ue looked again and found ic was a letter from his wife  at length i realize he said the bitterness of life   all these characters and others too are amusing but sylvie and bruno are as they j ought to be more interesting and amusing still from first to last they are delightful bruno who is addressed  yreince an abbreviation of your royal highness is even more fascinating than sylvie   i hope you have had a good night my child said the professor to him bruno looked puzzled  is had the same night oo ve had he replied  theres only been one night since yesterday   again when the two children encounter the gardener who being told by sylvie that bruno is her brother asks  was he your brother yesterday  course i were cried bruno who had gradually crept nearer and didnt at all like being talked about without having his share in the conversation  ah well the gardener said with a kind of groan  things change so here whenever i look again it a sure to be something different  yet i does my duty  i rets up wriggleearly at five if i was uo sud bruno i wouldnt wriggle so early its hs bad as being a worm  he added in an under i tone to sylvie  but you shouldnt be lazy in the morning bruno said sylvie  remember it a the early bird that picks up the worm  it may if it likes  bruno said with a slight yawn  i dont like eating worms one bit 1 always j top in bed till the early bird has picked them np   i wonder you ve the face to tell me euch fibs  cried the gardener to which bruno wisely replied oo dont want a face to tell fibs izonly a movf  bruno does not like snakes they are too waggly he is not  praticular but he likes  straight animals best he goes through his gardening most conscientiously carefully conforming to the rules of elfland being asked by the impersonal narrator what he is going to do with a dead mouse he has with him he answers  why its to measure with however would oo do a garden without one we make each bed three mouses and a half long and two mouses wide padding according to mr lewis carroll may be fitly defined as  that which all can write and none can read he does not absolutely affirm that there is none in the 395 pages in which the story of sylvie and bruno is told but does affirm that it is confined to a few lines here and there which have been inserted to eke out a page in order to bring a picture into its proper place he asks his readers to discover three lines of this kind which lurk in a passage extending from the top of p 35 to the middle of p 38 these three lines of padding however must either be undeserving of the epithet or there must be other bits of the same kind in the same pages else there would be no difficulty in disinterring them a free use of padding is however a charge that could never be brought against so gay and witty a writer as lewis carroll and if his definition be true proof will be given that padding is absent for sylvie and bruno is sure to be much read,novel_contra
monarch  the big bear of tallac by ernest thompson seton constable  co this is the life story of a giant grizzly in his infancy he is captured and tamed but after he has changed owners once or twice the call of the wild will no longer be denied and he escapes to enjoy the arcadian simplicity of his own natural life which is largely devoted to the slaying of men and sheep his taste is by no means exclusively for mutton however and presently a longindulged weakness for honey having proved his undoing he is captured by the very man who trained him as a cub and taken to san francisco mr seton is as picturesque and vivid as ever in this book the writing of which shows real insight his chapter headings are not over and above illuminative and such extreme americanisms as  when the semblance of his mate was gone gringo quit the place rather interfere with the charm of the storyat all events for readers upon this side of the atlantic but these are small matters  monarch the big bear by ernest thompson seton constable 5s mr thompson setons is a name with which to conjure in aqierica and he bids fair to become a popular force in this country among boys his intimacy with savage life together with his familiarity with animals of the wilds renders him an attractive figure to youth under his patronage the boyhood of the united states plays at injuns lives in teeoees and hunts and shoots all manner of game it may be that we shall witness the introduction of sabre indians cut to circumstances in our country meanwhile mr setons book gives us something to go on with  monarch the big bear  is very characteristic of the author it is the lifehistory of a grizzly from the time when on the tallac slopes he was captured as a cub to his last inglorious and pathetic end mr setons knowledge is beyond criticism it would take a bear himself to convict him of error and what to our mind is the most valuable point he does not paint his knowledge with the sentimentality so dear to this kind of book the bear is a bear not anthropomorphised out of its feral nature the bear does not think or remember except in so far as he thinks with his nose in vain you will look for the maudlin here mr seton has no room for it and his writing gains in dignity by that abstinence perhaps it is a little too elaborate at times a trifle overadorned but it is not given to all to resist the fascinations of the purple patch howbeit this is a most entertaining and engrossing story and should charm the hearts of old and young alike,novel_contra
sister teresa new novels by george moore fisher unwin mb moore gave no hint if we mistake not in the first edition of  evelyn innes that he intended to write a sequel so that although there is no suggestion of it there is still a possibility that  sister teresa may be followed by a third volume to complete the tragedy of evelyn inness career the need certainly seems to arise for it for the end arrived at in sister teresa is distinctly a case of bathos it will be remembered that evelyn inns was j represented in the first book as a person in o whom sensuality and idealism were constantly struggling for the mastery and there the struggle was left undecided in sister teresa the struggle still goes on only to cease at the end not because any solution has been come to but because evelyn has been ill and she finds that she has not the physical courage to escape from the convent as she had meant to do and that she can do no more than settle down to an inert vegetable existence as a music mistress in a convent school a dead soulless existence is undoubtedly a frequent outcome of such a struggle as there was in evelyns nature but it is no solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great novel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a novel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are

gg   he must go with her to the pure country to the woods and to the places where the invisible ones whom the druids knew etc  wandering in the woods and underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore novelist pure and simple we shall be content  notes on

the eustace diamonds the eustace diamonds by anthony trollope in three voomes chapman aod hall mr trollope has a place of his own and a very worthy place among novelists and moralists  and  the eustace diamonds  shows him at his best both as a moralist and asa novelist nearly all his men and women are wonderfully lifelike their characters and the incidents through which thosecharacters exhibit themselves are admirably portrayed and an excellent vein of satire genial yet searching in its way is shown in all his work the good sense that he always displays carries a moral that goes far beyond the ground to which his stories are apparently confined and perhaps without intending it certainly without weakening his books as mere works of fiction he uses them to preach very useful sermons on some of the follies and vices of the day in this respect 4the eustace diamonds is particularly noteworthy we do not know whether we have a right ta claim mr trollope as in aay way a supporter of the movement for improving the condition af women but if he is an unintentional ally his service is all the more valuable aad he could not possibly render better service than by his drawing of such characters as those el his two unheroic heroines in this novel lissie eustace and lucy morris lizzie shows cleverness that with scope given for its honest exercise would have made her as useful as she is clever but being poor aad having no other trade than marriage open to her she becomes only a becky sharp squanders all her wits and leads a very foolish and mischievous life lucy is as sweet and simple as a daisy but daisylike she runs a chance of being trampled down altogether and all because conventional restraints have made her unfit to hold her own against the stronger will and more selfish fancy of her lover frank greystock frank greystock the yet more unheroic hero is as useful as are the two young ladies in showing what poor sorts of persons are i produced by the orthodox arrangements of society and the unfortunate inequality of the sexes that now prevails and is as injurious to men as it is to women but the novel also points to other and kindred morals i within the figure and frame and clothes and cuticle within the bones and flesh of many of us there is but one persona man or woman with a preponderance either of good or evil whose conduct in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman such persons are simple single and perhaps generally safe they walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles and are today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow as they are today lady eustace was such a person and so was lucy morris opposite in their characters as two poles they were each of them a simple entity  and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman but there are human beingswho though of necessity single in body are dual in character in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good but to whom evil is sometimes horribly hideously evil but is sometimes also not hideous at all of such men it may be said that satan obtains an intermittent grasp from which when it is released the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble such menor women may hardly perhaps debase themselves with the more vulgar vices they will not be rogues or thieves or drunkardsor perhaps liars but ambition luxury selfindulgence pride and covetousness will get a hold of them and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices such a man waa freak greystock who could walk along the banks of the quiet troutgiving bob at bobsboroogb whipping the river with his rod telling himself that the world lost for tove would be a had thing well lost for a fine purpose  and who could also stand with his hands in his trousers pockets looking down upon the pavement in the purlieus of the courts of westminster and swear to himself that he would win the game let the cost to his heart be what it might what must a man be who would allow some undefined feeling some inward ache which he ealls a passion aad cannot analyse some desire which has come of instinct aad not of judgmentto interfere with all the projects of his intellect with all the work which he has laid out for his accomplishment circumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which indeed his meanswere insufficient but which he regarded as of all paths the noblest and the manliest if he could be true to himselfwith such truth as at these moments would seem to him to bethe truest truththere was nothing in rank nothing in ambition which might not be within his reach he might live with the highest the besteducated and the most beautiful he might assist ia directing national councils by his intelligence and might make a name for himself which should be remembered in his country and of which men would read the records in the histories written in after ages but to do this he must walk warily he an embarrassed man a man already in debt a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion was called upon to live and to live as though at his ease among those who had been bora te wealth and indeed he had so cleverly learned the ways of the wealthy that he hardly knew any longer how to live at his ease among the poor but had he walked warily when he went down to richmond and afterwards sitting alone in the obscurity of his chamber wrote the letter which bad made lucy morris so happy  the loves and pains the joys and struggles of these three persons form the basis of the plot of mr trollope  novel a diamond necklace furnishing the very ingenious thread on which it is strung in the prelude we learn that lizzie a poor orphan with good looks and spoilt talentt for her only fortune had succeeded in marrying lord eustace a rich and sickly youth and in causing him to die of a broken heart before a year was out when the detailed story begins she is trying to catch another husband by help of the fortune that she now possesses aa estate in scotland worth 4000 a year for life besides this however sha claims as her own property some splendid diamonds worth 10000 which the family solicitor regards as an heirloom that ought to ba given up for the benefit of her infant son when he suooeeds to the estate aad out of her greedy holding of these diamonds until they are stolen from her grow nearly all her troubles they cause her match with lord fawn to be broken off and bringing her into close intimacy with her cousin frank make her very anxious to form a match with him frank nearly yields to her fascinations and to the charm of her fortune and is accordingly very neglectful during more than two volumes of lucy morris the governess whom he really loves though he shrinks from marrying any one who has not some of the money that he sorely needs to help him on in his scheme of ambition nothing could be much better in its way than mr trollopes working out of frank greybtocks character shown in his flirtations with lizzie eustace in his honest lovemaking with lucy and in all his other actions throughout the book like persons goodhearted and even generous yet vacillating and in the main very selfish mr trollope has already described in great numbers but he always excels in this kind of portraiture and frank grey stock is equal to the best of his sort of course frank has enough distinguishing characteristics to justify his appearance in  the eustace diamonds and as long as such persons exist in real life and when will they cease to exist they can hardly be laughed at too often especially with such kindly laughter as slr trollope knows exactly how to arouse many of the minor persons in  the eustace diamonds are as carefully drawn as the principals especially lord fawn the dilletante undersecretary of state who regrets his engagement with lizzie very soon after it has been made yet is at his wits end to find some means of breaking it off without scandal

robert browning or thomas carlyle because he sells more books not that we begrudge him his success for a man is fairly entitled to that which he works for honestly and conscientiously but not for more one man works for success with the multitude and large immediate returns another for the esteem of the most cultivated and a reputation that will endure for ages and it is right that each should get his wishonly dont let the popularity hunter expect the crown of genius that amr tupper has his merits it would be foolish to deny lie is a diligent collector and transmnuter of other mens ideas for we sincerely believe that he never originated a single thought that was worth repeating and if precious gold does bocoume occasionally debased by the operation lie may stand excused on the ground of his

over and over again under forms which give it an air of novelty to the superficial all this mfr tupper has and we readily admit that such qualities entitle him to the lucrative ppularity which lie enjoys at the teatables and in the nurseries of this kingdom but when lie affiects the airs of a solomon upon the credit of  proverbial philosophy anl when in the look which is now before us lie attempts to take rank with sterne and the other great original hluinourist observers and when lie ranks himself in the category of persecuted men of genius and affects to believe that the unfavourable

quite superfluous it is impossible to reasd a page without knowing all about the identity of the author none but mr tupper can write as mlr tupper writes lie is inimitable simply because lie has qualities whicl no one who can write at all would care to imitate the leading characteristics of the volume arefirstly a succession of unsuclessful attempts to be humorous secondly a very unscrupulous appropriation of the jokes of other huniourists and thirdly a constant exhibition of soreness with respect to his critics  first you will wish to know why i was christened iesop there is a very obvious answer i was born smith this is the very first sentence of air tuppers work and is a fair specimen of the vein of humour which runs through it a remarkable example of the second and less excusable characteristic is to be found in the sixth page where we find southieys quaint definition of the word  news  1ide 4 dosttor  from the initials of the four cardinal points of the compass coolily appro priated without the slightest acknowledgment elx no c we could fill pages with similar proofs of delinquency but it is in dealing with his critics that esop smith alias peter query alies martin farquhar tupper comes out most grandly one of his great charges against that press which with a few exceptions has failed to appreciate mr tupper is that its writers are anonymous let victim reputations take comfort in this that the scribe who has indicted such murderous leaders is a mere miserable envious unit and that his multitudinous readers only read him for amusement but believe him not the licence of the press is working its own cure forasmuch as nobody now thinks any the worse of any man but rather all the better for a fierce onslaught of the power usurped by sundry calumniators who are but the dlantons and b1irabeaux of our illused fourth estate if this be really mr tuppers opinion why complain  surely he has been calumniaute o enough to feel 1 all the better turning over the page however we find that this improvement in his health is productive only of a terrible discharge of bile critics after  a sensitive young author are  huge gaunt fanged famished houndsso cowardly too a conspiracy of strong foes against one weak and harmless victim just so that is the proper function we admit and we would that the result were really to terrify air tupper and all other sensitive young authors into keeping their  weakness at home no man can properly be said to be lharmiless who bores part of the world and stultifies the rest with his platitudes but then says the antianonymous mr tupper under cover be it observed of air ffsop smith these fellows the critics are venal too in proof of this he states that he has received a letter from one of then requesting the loan of twenty pounds and otering favourable reviews in return for the same but here mr tupper has overshot his mnark and has alighted upon the horns of a dilemma either the anecdote is not true or it was the impudent attempt of a swindler to get money out of mir tupper upon false preteneesan attempt so f imyv that it ought not to have dcceived the simplest man in the world least of all one who pretends to write a sort of handbook of worldly wisdiom mr tupper must have known or his knowlclge is i not worth much that any man having the power to insert reviews in several papers

the new republic or culture faith and philosophy in an english country house 2 vols chatto fc windus for more than half of the present century english society and english letters had the advantage of being reflected in a series of halffictitious halfsatirical writings to which hardly any previous parallel can be found from the days of stagecoaches to those of telegraphs from the time when the english gentleman devoted himself to madeira and barouche driving to that in which he took to laborious reading for honours and equally laborious lecturing on things in general these books extended they were written by a man of extensive scholarship of much knowledge of the world and of sufficiently clear and definite tastes to give him a position from which to look ont and to criticize they constantly introduced wellknown personageb and always wellknown ideas and hobbies both the personages and the ideas were frequently caricatured but the caricature was alway so artistically done that it was of more value than the dull fidelity of any number of photographs it was difficult sometimes to recognise coleridge in mr flosky and mr mystic scythrop and shelley were not always identifiable and mr feathernest was clearly a libel on southey but there was no mere parody and no mere misrepresention and these stories from  headlong hall to  gryll orange have therefore never lacked readers and admirers though there have sometimes been brisk young men of letters who have fondly imagined that they had  discovered  peacock this digressive beginning is pardonable because it is absolutely certain that no one will read the new republic without having  crotchet castle and the rest constantly in his mind and because the merits we have noticed in peacocks books are those the want of which will be chiefly felt in the author before us he has imagined we give the scheme of the book because it is not reprinted verbatim from the magazine in which it first appeared a saturday to monday party of londoners guested in a seaside villa which their host otho lawrence has inherited from a rich and intellectual but improper uncle the story if story there be goes no further and the contents of the book are expanded to two volumes first by the device not altogether copyright of having subjects for conversation written on the menu of the saturdays dinner and secondly by the institution of a sunday debating club to cany out the ideas thus started and to frame an utopia in the good old platonic fashion these conversations and debates fill np the whole space with the exception of a few pieces of description after the manner of a nineteenth century  minute philosopher all the interest centres in the characters who are no strangers there is mr herbert who has strikingly original ideas on art and ideas still more strikingly original on ethics and political economy mr luke who is equally enamoured of culture of conduct and of his own very peculiar ideas of christianity mr rose whose sentences are of a marvellous modulation and in whose mouth the name of botticelli is no stranger mr storks whom the physical basis of life knows mr stockton who has both spoken and heard of  the infinite azure and the rev dr jenkinson who has silvery hair is great upon plato and does not at all like to have it supposed that he is not equally great upon the new testament of less notorious personages or of personages with no notoriety at all there are several of whom the most prominent besides the host a wellmeaning but feeble young man who would like to have a mission if he knew how and lord allen a variety of the same species are mr saunders a very disagreeable youth in pink stockings with a profound disbelief in everything but himself and mr j s mill and mrs sinclair a poetess who combines an ethereal aspect with some vulgarity the conversations turn first on no less alarming a subject than the aim of life and the subsequentlyfounded utopia is intended to give expression on each speakers part to this ailsa in the pragma of the disxjurae the accuracy of parody it simply aatoniwhing there is probably not one educated reader in a hundred who on reading most of mr herberts speeches will not rack his brains to remember in whioh of certain wellknown and now not easily procurable volumes they occur the sermon which practically doses the book might very well have found a home between the drab covers which issue monthly from a certain kentish village  and a speech of mr roses at vol il p 179 really sets one wondering whether ones own copy of some studies on strongly ribbed paper which appeared four years ago is imperfect or not this is all very well but it does not need demonstration that the parodist element is one which bhould be kept to its place and that that place is a minor one a parody in two volumes is something of a monstrosity and one certainly tyres of such a pro longed concert with all parts sustained only by the mockingbird nor is this the only charge which must be brought against the book there are some touches in one character wbich cannot but be regarded as the gravest possible offences against good taste good manners and fair play it would be a repetition of the offence to particularise them here  and they are unfortunately not likely to escape the notice or it may be hoped the censure of any instructed reader a worse fault perhaps artistically though an infinitely more venial one in every other way is the absence of a foil to all taheee intellectual personages there is indeed a certain lady ambrose who is intended we suppose to supply this want but as she is a mere woman of the world with almost all the usual defects and less than the usual brains of the character the contrast is too glaring to be good or satisfactory we want to recur to peacock a dr opimian or a lady clorinda to give us a milieu of sense not wholly divorced from intellect the book is so clever a book despite its faults that it deserves criticism of the admonitory rather than the objurgatory kind we should have to go far before we found such a brilliant putting into words of the famous butlerian maxim as this conscience in most souls is like an english sovereign it reigns but it does not govern or such neat phrases ns the following  m a cynic is a kind of inverted confessor perktually niaking enemies for the sake of what he lows to be false  life is the preface to eternity  unfortunately it is a preface that we cannot skip and the dedication is generally made to the wrong person  the whole teachings of that school have always seemed to me nothing more than a few fragments of science imperfectly understood obscured by a few fragments of christianity imperfectly remembered  you forget said leslie that dr jenkinsons christianity is really a new firm trading under an old name and trying to purchase the goodwill of the former establishment  the chief good of the former nation germany which is perhaps the

  a few remarkable events in the life of the rev josiah thotnpsonf a secession minister showing the evil effects of volutdary churches and the secession church in the north of england in particular by nathan oliver esq this is a very excellent as well as a very humorous satire upon the principle of voluntary churches which principle is drolly enough incarnated in the singular person of josiah thompson we have him from ins youth upwards and a more despicable character notwithstanding it is so ludicrous cannot be conceived his subserviency to all and his excessively mean servility to those particularly who have it in their power to starve him into degradation and shabbiness are portrayed with a fidelity that at first view must be allowed to be unquestionable wrhen people are required to buy their own religion they will first of all go to the cheapest market and ultimately to none at all it is not just to instance the wellworking of the voluntary principle in america for this simple reason that it has not yet worked long enough  and that just now there is a spirit of competition among the eliflferent forms of faith that tends as yet to keep religion or the profession of it a little longer in existence lt will be found that acting on the voluntary principle man will treat his faith as did the daughters of lear the outcast king when they were enabled to apply the voluntary principle to their filial hospitality we can conceive nothing more wretcneel nothing more sordid nothing alternately more subversive to religion and morality for a congregation than first to degrade their spiritual pastor into a despicable beggarly sycophant and then to cast on to utter helplessness their own creation that such in general would be the consequence who can doubt we see in this principle a total change in the natural oreler of things for the sheep would certainly become the monitors the keepers and the controllers of their pastors and silly sheep in the end if not lost ones they would assuredly prove themselves the quiz in this work is admirably conceived and felicitously maintained throughout wre see that the author has borrowed a very droll incident from one of  colmans broad grins that of the shirtless person which is exceeelingly applicable and what would be often likely to ensue there is no more efficient method of attacking religion than through the respectability of its ministers and the contempt thrown upon the preacher will not be long in extending itself to the doctrine independently of its merits as a witty literary composition we recommend this work to a general perusal on much higher grounds for truly it proves that not only are the interests of religion assaulteel all over the empire but insidious enemies are undermining the very citaelel of christianity,novel_contra
  memoir of annie keary by her sister mac millan  co this story of a singularly sweet and beautiful life told simply and unassumingly by the only person who could tell it aright has a strange pathos the incidents in it are nothing there is little variety little that is tragic until the brave uncomplaining end  yet the life is intensely interesting the pathos lies not in the subject but in the fact that the life had to be written so early annie kearyshe was annie or aunt annie to all who knew her and somehow it was difficult to call her miss kearywas not in the least sad herself and though her quiet life had its sorrows and bitter trials it was rich in love she was not of a nature to be lonely her gentle character drew friends around her wherever she went and her friends never left her or ceased to feel the quickening power of her influence in wielding this influence she was happy and her chief joy was to work upon other natures to help them in doubt and difficulty to keep the ideal and spiritual life awake in thom whether as a motheraunt to her brothers children as a friend of workhouse girls a worker in hospitals among the poor in reformatories she is always the same sympathizing helpful guide the book is full of letters written to those whom she had befriended in their time of need and with whom a lifelong affection was the result as the reader peruses them he can understand in some degree the tender reverence which she inspired in people of all shades of character and mind none ever went to her with his troubles without coming away stronger to bear them and to have been her friend meant to many to have been lifted into a higher world there is a part that cannot be touched upon in a review which many will find more attractive than anything else in though volume this is not the place to enter into the earnest workings of a deeply religious spirit those who would knowhow one who was keenly open to intellectual argument met the altering phases of the last thirty years must read the memoir itself and when they have begun they will not stop at present we prefer to confine ourselves to the more public side of miss kearys life and see how the memoir bears upon her literary career it is interesting to notice that it was in a sober puritanical family life with its strictly kept sunday quakerlike plainness of costume and emptiness of all amusement its plan of trying to throw dishonour on the flesh and inculcation that  the next best thing to not having good looks was not knowing that you had them that annie keary like the brontes developed her imagination the chapter on her childhood is one of the most charming parts of the book  for the fairy tales and adventures in the land of fancy which have delighted two generations of children in blindmans holiday and other of her stories grew up out of the games and amusements of the playroom in a dull house at hull from earliest childhood annie keary was a storyteller she made the nursery a palacea kingdom as with a magicians wand there were days  when the higher powers would be taken away from the house by outside duties and the small domain would be untenanted save by the children and then there ensued a delicious time after racing for hours from hiding place to hiding place after seeing hearing feoling escaping from such dangers as those of the den of thieves  after the excitement of long blindfolded journeys to magic land and of actual contact with the wonders there grownup people and nurses might talk as they pleased might call things by commonplace names might scold and trouble and fuss but they could not rob us of the knowledge of the truth they could not shut us up in the prison world from which we had had such escape not for many many days at least when this creator of magic land for herself and her brothers and sisters grew up she began to tell and write the same delightfully mysterious fancies for other children it was for her nephews and nieces that most of her early tales were written and these childrens books were among her most successful achievements the cause of her success was simple she loved children and thus she came to know them well at her brothers house in staffordshire  everything she did was inspired by or turned towards what was the centre of her lifeher care of the children whatever new thing she learned of bird or insect or flower whatever beauty she discovered in written book or living action she took straight to them as a motherbird carries treasure to her nest all changes of the hours every season of the year she set and turned to the requirements of nursery life  in summer time the little garden and the field the banks of the canal close by the bluebell woods further away had each their changing pleasures the nursery nay the whole house in winter afternoons and in the evening fireglow were no less the inspirers of games or quaint weird fairy tales some of the prettiest of her childrens fairy tales  little wanderlin amongst them were written for that nursery in writing it was always necessary for her to realise her hearers and she never gave shape to her fancies more pleasurably than she did when fashioning for that one childaudience she loved so well that necessity of  realising her hearers applies to her later and larger writings she did not take seriously to literature till she was past thirty when the sorrow of leaving the home in trent vale and the death of her father and two favourite brothers had thrown her back upon herself  the first shaping of her tales was especially a happiness to her the nucleus of these was always some little cluster of persons whom she suddenly seemed to find in her mind and who as she lived in thought with them became more clearly known to her whose natures unfolded themselves as regularly according to some inward law as a flower blossoms and a fruit reaches its perfection tales were never suggested to her by events it was always character that developed plot and it never seemed to her as if she invented characters she used to say that her heroes and heroines were quite alive and real and that they spoke and acted of themselves independently of her control as long as any tale was upon the stocks she lived in it with a bort of double life which kept her as only imagination can keep people from the narrowing effects of routine or the roughening of little daily cares she wrote anywherein the midst of talk at a bedside never in a place apart yet  the act of expression was often a great effort to her  she used to say it took her twice as long and wasted twice as much of her force as it need have done because of a certain slowness of mind which her early habit of living in dreams that lead to no result had engendered still she wrote  doggedly on on her bad days as well as her good days and was happy or unhappy according as the day was fruitful or not the pleasure of writing outweighed the pain but when the book was finished there came a reactionthere seemed to be  something startlingly prosaic in the work done compared with the doing of it and besides the ideal companions of many happy weeks or months had suddenly departed and then came the ordeal of the reviews  she never got enough used to little rubs against the world not to suffer by them even the seeing of her own name in print was something of an annoyance to her and she never got over an absolute dread of reading a review annie keary was ever too diffident and selfmistrustful castle daly her best novel though she curiously disliked writing it and was surprised at its success first gave her confidence and we can trace the result in the firm hand which drew the characters of  a doubting heart her last book the actors in these and her other novels may be traced in real life in the memoir and the charming scenes in the south of france which we meet in  a doubting heart are reproduced in some delightful letters from pegomas we can only refer to the egyptian letters which are full of faithful yet imaginative pictures and show the wakeful observant eye that is apparent not only in the book she afterwards published the  early egyptian history but in all her works there is only one fault to find with the memoir and that is that there is not enough mention of the writer miss eliza keary has studiously ignored the large part she herself played in her sisters life in another biographer selfeffacement might be a virtue but in this instance the omission of almost all reference to the narrator takes away from the completeness of the narrative,novel_contra

had succeeded to praise a child for any precocious faculty or personal grace is a sure way to deprive it of its charm and men are but children of a larger growth when all has been said that can be said about nipping genius in the bud the fact remains that literature has lost at least as much by cordial recognition as by stupid indifference with all his enormous resources dickens never equalled the rich humour of the  pickwick papers which he poured forth in happy unconsciousness before selfconfidence had been superseded by the unanimous applause of the reading world and his standard of excellence had been removed outside himself the most perfect of  george eliots works is adam bede which she wrote when she was in the expectancy and without the fear of fame it is not that the faculty decays but that its movements are no longer free and unembarrassed the youthful aspirant in literature has more to fear from his friends than from his enemies his prayer should be to be delivered from the hands of favourable reviewers colonel lockhart is not now a beginner in novel writing so that we need not disguise the pleasure with which we have read his last production from any fear of stopping the supply he has had no inconsiderable share of praise but he has passed through the ordeal unscathed  mine is thine so far from being a falling off from his previous works is an advance upon them profiting by experience and exercise colonel lockhart has knit the parts of his story more firmly together and the qualities which made fair to see so enjoyablethe fresh exuberant humour the firm grasp of character the unaffected sympathy with romantic passion the exhilarating description of life in the open air show no signs of having lost their edge his hand has gained in cunning and none of his natural force is abated at the beginning of the third volume one almost wishes that colonel lockhart had been content to wind up the story in two volumes he begins there to raise a suspicion that the remainder of the novel is to be a political treatise consisting mainly of an exposition of the principles of moderate conservatism in which his hero found a career even if we had not had little sympathy with the creed expounded we imagine we should have looked upon this plunge into politics in a novel of which the main interest is not political as an unprofitable deviation but the dull interval does not last long after some chapters of commonplace when the reader feels inclined to throw down the book as containing no incident that he could not guess without reafding it and no reflection that he has not heard before a new subject of interest is suddenly started and curiosity is kept on the alert and the sense of hunmour agreeably titillated to the end the outline of colonel lockharts novel the case ot a youno ngan a sort of coningsby or lothair with a well riurked difference crossed in love for a woman framed not merely to mnake hiim happy but to foster all that

and gratifying her own consummate talents for intrigue by making a match between him and miss douglas the only child of lord germistoune a scotch peer with an income of 200001 a year in land the prosecution of this scheme forms the sideplot of the novel miss douglas being the heroine who by her own personal charms and not by the magic of her rentroll has captivated the heart of the hero cosmo glencairn nothing could be more humorous than colonel lockharts account of toms backward wooing and the determined wiles of his matchmaking sister whose scheme he assents to only as a temporary means of obtaining loans from her tom has no liking for marriage even as a relief from thickening embarrassments but he observes mrs ravenhalls directions to the extent of trying to look grave and serious in miss douglass presence when his sisters eye is upon him and gives her most rosecoloured accounts of his progress in the young ladys affections alike in the dialogues between tom and miss douglas and the interviews between him and his sister when she questions him as to what he said and how miss douglas looked colonel lockhart overflows with humour for example in one of toms talks with the lady to whom he is supposed to be making love but whom he amuses with sporting reminiscences and interests greatly to the detriment of his sisters scheme with anecdotes about his friend glencairn miss douglas asks whether mr glencairn is a good shot and the dialogue proceeds as follows excellent he does everything he does do well  i suppose he is always in earnest about everything he does   thats the secret perhaps it would bore me now to be in earnest about anything except of course sport and  observing his sisters sug gestive eye upon him and of course one or two other serious matters esm6 laughed  i wonder she said  what you would rank with sport as serious matters   hang it thought tom  shes laughing at me im on the wrong tack somehowbut he jerked out a sentence to the effect that  for every man there is something sacred and serious and then remembering immortal mr guppy and his refrain  there are chords had well nigh broken down  so that you have profited by mr glencairns society you are not altogether an unworthy disciple laughed esm  disciple god forbid im not a disciple at all i wouldnt go in for glencairns line of business for the world life is too short  still for every man there is something sacred and seriousyou are convinced of that  said esmb with profound gravity  oh of course i am andandall that kind of thing you know then their eyes met and they both went off into hearty fits of laughter  i have always understood thought tom that if a woman once laughs at you you may as well cry off  at once and throw up the sponge now this girl is laughing at me and small blame to her and i feel that if i were ever so much in love with her i couldnt get on the proper tack not today at least i suspect after dinner would be my only chance i believe moonlight has a wonderful effect upon the female nature and dry champagne in sufficient quantities has almost made me sentimental once or twice yes i must try it some other time under more favourable circumstances at present i cant score thats clear then seeing his sister cross the room he rose and said  i must go and sound lord germistoune about the punts and thus ended the first scene of toms little drama  lamoureux malgri lui an equally hearty explosion of laughter is the issue of the formal proposal to which tom is at last forced by his sister to commit himself we wish we had space to quote some specimens of mrs ravenhalls difficulties in managing lord germistoune the skill with which she surmounted them and the misadventures which now and then upset her best laid schemes lord germistoune is a most laughable caricature of an aggressive titled autocrat of the old school as open as a child to mrs ravenhalls flattering wiles but brooking no overt contradiction keenscented as a vulture to any attack upon his dignity and charged to the muzzle with strong language against every manifestation of the modern spirit his own account of his treatment of a remonstrance made to him by

mean rabbits  i said rabbits hares and winged game too particularly woodpigeons they answered   well i said why dont you add crows magpies and sparrows and slugs and snails and everything that eats anything on a farm but what do you want   they said that their crops were being eaten and they wanted the game to be killed down to a reasonable limit i told them that the game tuas within a fair limit and not more than enough for the sport which i had a right to expect for myself and my friends on my estate which i begged to remind them was my own but our crops are being eaten they said and so they ought to be i replied  in a fair proportion game i then explained to them  is placed on a property by divine providencejust as wind blows on it sun shines on it rain and hail fall upon it by the decree of providence the crops suffer a little from all these things by the decree of providenceand by the same decree the game eats the crops in a fair proportion great heavens p i said are you going to fly in the face of providence  they declined to fall in with this view of the matter and i then remarked  when you became farmers you knew what you had to expect when you signed your leases you knew all these things and what the devil do you mean by trying to squeeze me for more than your covenant gives your we want justice they aid no i replied  you want injustioeinjustice for me  andthenigave it them hot  ill tell you what it is i said if you think im going to be harried and bothered by a lot of malcontents youre mistaken ill make you an offer it is a good deal more than justit is foolishly generous ill cancel your leases if you like and all the leases on the estate and turn it all into a gamepreserve there  i believe there is a good market for game and i daresay i

ended in his producing a bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being a 1 under j the influence of the crackers and sausage

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin

the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a

welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken

least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the

a bride of japan by carlton dawe hutchinson  co the englishman who contrary to the advice of his friends marries a japanese girl and suffers for it is depicted in this story as the saddest of mankind the marriage is a hopeless failure and the reader is spared very few of the horrors with which the mans life is surrounded indeed those who shun horrors had better not read the book the japanese wife has been depicted in very different colours by other writers the picture here presented is most melancholy in places it is even offensive the book is cleverly written  a bride of japan by carlton dawe 6 hutchinson a man who can devise a fairly fresh setting for this weary marriage question deserves credit though his book were the poorest of the season and when his book is not the poorest of the season but a powerful rational and at the same time moral story and when its setting is among the quaint surrounding little known to us except in comic opera and on ladies embroidered screens then the writer has a claim on our gratitude t4e subject is serious enoughthe terrible tragic power that convention holds over a mans happiness and even over his moral wellbeing the story is very pitiful but very probable and it is in the apparent injustice and yet the inevitableness of it all that its tragedy lies the writer has the power of commanding our sympathy at almost every point we feel the charm of the maiden in her grey kimono waiting outside the sunny japanese garden with its plumblossom fragrance and we share the englishmans repugnance at the sight of his wife in barbarian finery posturing in her fantastic dance the natural ending would be in gloom but the writer is wise to lighten his tragedy a little and let his hero and his reader say a peaceful if pathetic farewell to the lovely but illstarred sarasan,novel_contra

master once and once onlylie was then youn and in the ardent springtime of his passion she absented himself for a couple of days but i repeat it he committed this escapade only once the distinctive

way of parenthesis let it be known moreover that he iwaas ridiculously ugly and that no servant male or female let slip an occasion of making merry over his 1 disagreeable exterior valetke bore all

resolved to be rich by edward h cooper duckworth  co there is an obvious difficulty in reconciling the two themes of which this story is composed both subjects are well handled but it is hard to see why they should be associated a group of persons living in north staffordshire and some swindling companymongers who plunder those who wish to be rich are vividly described but then a marchioness and her love affairs are unnecessarily dragged in and the author is hard put to it to impart cohesion to the subjects he introduces there was a brilliant marchioness in one of mr coopers earlier novels and her story was well worth narrating  but the lady who figures in the book now under notice is neither attractive nor clearly delineated there are clever passages and there are clever observations but in our view the book is not nearly so good as mr cooper has given his readers reason to expect of him  resolved to be eich by edward h cooper this novel by the author of mr blake of newmarket is well described by its title and the moral of the story is unobtrusively patent on every pageif we may put it so thus  their love of money becomes gradually absorbed into a passion for moneygetting which is not only the most unhappy disease upon earth but nearly always brings its victims into difficulties and thence occasionally into gaol for the simple reason that there is a limit to the amount of money which you can get honestly at the end of the story there is a liberal distribution of sentences of penal servitude duckworth  co 6s,novel_contra

the thing in the woods by margery williams duckworth and co 6s mysterystories with ghostly thrills in them are growing fewer possibly because the psychical research society has transformed so many spooks into commonplace and rather depressing things so that when we come across a yarn with a real thrill in it we are not over captious with regard to its probability or the manner of its telling this is a real mystery story concerning the likelihood of an uneducated yankee dutchman turning into a thing with long nails that made awful scratches on people and caused sundry horrors in some pennsylvanian woods at odd times lycanthropy is given at the end as the partial solution of the mystery but the author is wise in not turning up all the lightsa thing guessed at is always twice as impressive a j a thing known for an american story with an american doctor as its hero there is very little american ring about the book save for one old darkey and his rabbits foot the whole story the people and the language are thoroughly english this however is a detail though a few more yankee traits in the characters would have made the whole thing more probable in the meantime bearing in mind the scarcity of thrilling stories we welcome this as a fairly good one the scene in the pit of the ruined sawmill is gruesome enough for anyone and there is of course a love interest by way of relief,novel_contra

reviews of books rachel ray mr trollope is one of the few novelists who make us forget the labour of criticism in our enjoymient of their books he throws off his novels with the ease of a man writing to some friend the latest gossip of his circle and seems as much amused with the foibles and humours of his characters as if he were laugghing at persons he had seen and heard and not at the creatures of his imagination this characteristic of his writing he has nowhere displayed more strikingly than in the novel before us it is almost a laugh from beginning to end marked here and there with touches of pathos effectively thrown in and though at times verging on caricature only violating the truth of nature to the extent of a slight exaggeration without plot and almost without incident we are carried through the book by the writers exuberant spirits and his way of turning to us the quizzical side of his characters but still more by the power with which he realises the manners the habits and speech of english life in their homeliest garb they are real beings who play their part in his story we have met them have spoken and lived with them we have sat with them in their houses have walked with them over the fields watched with them the setting sun by the churchyard stile and shared their loves and jealousies their weaknesses and their virtues we have seen before this cottage interior with its halfdozen books with gilt leaves arranged in shapes on the small round table where also is deposited the spangled mat of wondrous brightness made of short white sticks of glhss strung together with its shells and china figures on the chimneypiece the birdcage without a bird the old sofa the old armchair and carpet and the old round mirror over the fireplace we have some experience of mrs tappitts nianceuvres to convert a teaparty into a ball and win her lord and master by beautifully fine degrees to consent to one expense after another till the accumulation involves as an absolute necessity a still further outlay for which he is to be consoled by one of her best beefsteak puddings and who that has not been buried all his life in unredeemed bricks and mortar has not met mrs sturt the farmers wife who likes a young man who does the thing thats honest and is willing to lend her friendly aid to bring two young people together again who have been separated by the stupid interference of soured or silly meddlers  with such traits does  rachel ray abound and if it is not to be ranked though we doubt this with mr trollopes best works he has written nothing which will give his readers more thorough delight the design of his tale is to show how excessively mischievous overgood people may make themselves and that there is a practical malignity even about religion itself when it is pushed to an unnatural extreme with this view mr trollope begins by placing before us a lady very good and very weak whom he describes as one of those women who cannot grow alone as standard trees but for whom the support and warmth of some wall some paling some post is absolutely necessary who in their growth will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach while he lived mrs ray leaned upon her husband but on his death leaving her with two daughters the eldest of whom dorothea took after her father and was stem sober and steady the widow  immediately married herself to this girl who became thenceforth the prop against which she could grow but in time dorothea shared and became widow prime at the end of a year returning at the end of that time to her mothers cottage  black and stiff and stern to be her mothers prop once more mr trollope describes this womans character with great gusto prim and tidy by nature  it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance therefore she was rough with weeds her caps were  lumpy heavy full of woe and clean only as decency might requirenot nicely clean with feminine care her dress too was rough and black and clingingdisagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any wcmin which is worn day after day through all hours though naturally welllooking her desire had been to e ugly forbidding attractive almost repulsive so thats in ver truth she might be known to be a widow indeed she was t8ilf no bp ebut  she had taigt muel to

which her heart was set against this lady as against a wall whose support was  strong but not at all times pleasant leaned mrs ray to her own satisfaction but not quite to that of her younger daughter rachel who was neither weak nor stern but willing to take such pleasure as life offered her disliked mrs primes dorcas meetings and displayed  a little wickedness now and then to the extent perhaps of a vain walk into baslehurst on a summer evening a little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and whom she had seen a yawn in church or a word of complaint as to the length of the second sunday sermon the reader soon finds that in one of her walks rachel has seen  a young man this fact explodes like a bombshell in the cottap at braggs end and mrs ray holding the lupine theory with regard to youths of the opposite sex we see that what with her timidity on this score and mrs primes uncompromising enmity to happi ness of any kind rachers relations with the  young man from the brewery will be as little pleasant as it is possible for the two widows to make them but luke rowan the wolf in question is a youth of strong decision of character he has made up his mind to love rachel and that rachel shall love him which the girl is willing enough to do the day after mrs tappitts ball luke finds his way to braggs end and startles mrs rays confidence in her theory by the frankness with which he confesses his love and asks permission to visit rachel but above all by the way in which he takes his tea quite like a steady young man indeed she says defending herself against mrs primes remonstrances  he drank three large cups and if as rachel says he alajoes  to church regularly i dont know why we are to judge him anw say that hes anything out of the way the bickerings between mrs ray and her eldest daughter on this subject are described with the nicest discrimination of character and with an undercurrent of great humouir what is a higher testimony to mr trollopes power is the skill with which he develops rachels character in t conflict between the widows and the touches of purely natural and beautiful emotion by which he wins us to love her the dialogue between rachel and mrs ray after mrs prime has left them in which the girl tries to draw from her mother what luke has sai about her while she ran over to the farmers to fetch cream for the tea is one of the most charming of the many exquisite passages m these volumes mrs ray  so inconsequent in her mental workings so shandypated that it did not occur to her that an entirely new view of luke rowans purposes had been exposed to rach during this visit of mrs primes and not realising the fact that she had authorised rachel to regard luke as her lover while rachel remembers every word and begins to think that with hex mothers leave an intimacy with luke would be very pleasant but what was it that he did say mamma 9that is if you dow think it wrong to tell me i hardly know but i dont snppose it can be wrong for no young man could have spoken nicer and it made me happy to hear himso it did for the moment oh mamma do tell me and rachel kneeled down before her  wellhe said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen did he mamma and the girl clng closer to her mother a she heard the pleasant words but i oughtnt to tell you such nonsense as that and then 1h said that he wanted to come out here and see you andandand it is simply this that he meant to ask you to be his sweeheart if i would let him   and what did you say mamma  i couldnt eay anything because you came back bat you told dolly  mrs prime that you would be glad to ae him whenever he might choose to come here did i yes you said he was welcome to come whenever he plemb and that you believed him to be a very good

interview between mrs tappitt mrs rowan and mrs ray when the two former ladies visit the widow to represent to her the impropriety of a marriage between luke and rachel is again a proof of the ability with which the author holds his characters in hand and brings out their several idiosyncracies but perhaps the best thing in the novel is the pertinacity with which luke rowan deterniines either to drive old tappitt out of the brewery or compel him to brew good beer though it was a sour and muddy stream that flowed from his vats a beverage disagreeable to the palate and very cold and uncomfortable to the stonach tappitt made fifteen hundred a year out of it and to be told by a youngster that he did not know how to brew good beer was an indignity he could not put up with but the choleric old brewer is no match for luke cool and resolute at all hazards to brew good beer for baslehurst even if he is obliged to build a new brewery he threatens to do this and goes so far as to purchase the requisite ground then mrs tappitt seeing ruin staring her and her dauighters in the face urges her husband to take the thousand per annuim which luke has offered him in exchange for his interest in the old firm  till after much resistance and many resolutions to fight the battle out tappitt comes home from the dragon one night much the worse from eating  that accursed fish  and the next day sick in stomach and racked with headache lies utterly at his wifes mercy and consents to take lukes offer the scene in which this occurs is a capital domestic interior in mr trollopes best style if we are to find fault with this delightful story we might object that the artifice by which the stream of rachels love is disturbed is improbable that her mother would have been advised to make her write the letter which for a time clouds her joy and makes it doubtful whether the lover who broke in on her almost solitary and very humble life with such a sunburst of undreamt of happinessadvised too by the clergyman who had given such a sensible judgement on the question whether it would be sinful if she went to mrstappitts ballis notwethink likely that lovingluke as she did she would write it is less probable for rachel has a will of her own but that lukehonest straightforward manly lover as he isshould be put off by it should not feel the love that throbs under its air of prudence and attribute the love to rachel and the prudence to her stupid counsellors is less likely still but as this letter gives us two volumes when but for it we could only have had one we shall not quarrel with it and after all nothing is so flexible as human nature and to say that it will do this or will not do that under given circumstances is to forget how often it acts in contradiction to itself and again how often acts that seem to be contradiction on the surface are logical enough if we could minutely weigh the feelings from which they spring,novel_contra

transformation or the romance of monte beni by natl a niel hawthorne 3 vols smith  eldersince the publication of his last work seven years ago mr hawthorne has spent some time in rome where the scenes of  transformation  are almost exclusively laid judging from internal evidence we should conclude that his visit to the eternal city was very short limited probably to two or three winter or early spring months and of course including the carnival although the book is full of rome and of art the authors acquaintance with either is evidently superficial of italian rome he knows nothing of rome in summer he knows nothing of society and even of that curious phase of society exhibited by the  artist life  in rome he knows little or nothing it is true that none of those subjects fall specially within the scope of his book but any one who has lived long in rome and penetrated however slightly within the barriers of galleries and studios must have shown some glimpses of the knowledge he would thus acquire for which we look in vain through the three volumes of  transformation every thing told us about the city itself might have been gathered during a few weeks perambulation of its streets under the charge of a clever cicerone or with the perhaps more intelligent companionship of a guidebook and as for art mr hawthornes treatment is very simple he takes some of the most celebrated works guidos  beatrice cenci  archangel michael or the  cleopatra and makes studies of them though not with the sympathies of a pictorial but those of a rhapsodical artist in other respect also his sympathies are singularly narrow and national that the personages of his fiction when anglosaxon it alleven to the anonymous priest who crosses the storyshould be american or as the author prefers to call them new englanders is excusable enough he has the most perfect right to select his characters from his fellowcountrymen but that every modern work of art which he mentions with eulogy should be the production of new england genius while the only old english name introduced is that of gibson brought forward solely to controvert that artists wellknown theory of tinted statuary shows a narrow exclusiveness of mind which we did not expect to find in mr hawthorne the chief excellence of the book lies in its descriptive passage mr hawthorne has a quick eye for scenery natural or architectural with a vivid style and ready command of pictorial language which euable him to describe with force and felicity his enthusiasm for antiquity and art is also genuine though somewhat spasmodic as a work of fiction  transformation with its scanty incident its unsolved mystery and its inconclusive conclusion will hardly satisfy the english novelreader the story more a mystery than a horror would seem to have been founded upon that remarkable legend mentioned in  coningsby of the highly respectable county family of featherstonehaugh who for several generations had been distinguished by the strange and humiliating peculiarity of being born with sheeps tailsa fact which they had kept secret for generations but at length they took decided measures to get rid of this inconvenient appendage so  transformation  represents first the peculiarity and then the change which befalls a certain donatello count of monte beni who was born to long furry ears like a faun at his first introduction to the reader donatello is standing by the faun of praxiteles and some artist friends comment upon the resemblance between the man and the statue not only in external likeness but also in character  no faun in arcadia says one of them  was ever a greater simpleton than donatello he has hardly a mans share of wit small as that is it is a pity that there are no longer any of this congenial race of rustic creatures for him to consort with the resemblance is afterwards worked out with much skill and gracefulness marred only by incessant references to donatellos strange reluctance to show his ears on this lighthearted halfwitted and irresponsible creature a total change is effected by the perpetration of a hideous crime the agent of his transformation is called miriam who seems to have dispensed with any other name a being of course endowed with surpassing beauty who lives in a studio and is a mystery she is persecuted by a most disreputablelooking old man who claims to possess some secret by which he is enabled to control her destiny his name is never told nor his secret revealed and the whole idea has been oftenand we must add much betterworked out in the london journal and other penny periodicals donatello who has become attached to miriam gets provoked by the reiterated appearances of her persecutor always at inopportune moments and at length takes an opportunity of tumbling him over the tarpeian rock the revulsion caused by this crime transoms him from a halfwitted lighthearted faun to a responsible but melancholy man a strange and uncomfortable sort of connexion then springs up between the pair whom this murder has joined together and their final fate is left in impenetrable mystery miriam throughout the btory has nothing womanlike about her she resembles rather what the old demonologiets termed a  succubus and is last seen tossing her arms wildly about in the pantheon of donatellos destiny we can form only an unpleasant suspicion that he has fallen into the hands of the police besides this pair there is another hilda and kenyon the former a paintress and type of virgin purity the latter a sculptor and a model loverboth natives of new england and both mere abstractions or rather lay figures who talk aesthetics and philosophy get mixed up more or less with miriams mystery and donatellos crime make love to one another in a very insipid manner and in the end marry and return to their native land mr hawthorne has done and we hope will do much better than this we trust to meet him again on more congenial scenes his  scarlet letter and  house with seven gables have shown that he can draw the character of new englanders right well when he meets them  at home  in new england  transformation or the romance of monte beni by nathaniel hawthorne 3

fourth romances will be measured by their two predecessors without reference to the fact that there may be slow growth and solitary perfection in works of genius the yew and the locusttree have different natural habits then for one to whom all europe is looking for a part of its pleasure to stop the course of his labours is a piece of independence hard to forgive thirdly there is hazard in an attempt to change the scale of creative exercise when an artist has shown himself perfect in the one originally adopted the masters of cabinet  painting whom it would be wise to commission to cover a ceiling are not many raphael could produce the pitti ezekiel and the cartoons it is true rembrandt could paint the temple scene in jerusalem which england possesses as also the gigantic duke of gueldres in the berlin gallery  but raphaels and rembrandts are few it is only fit fair and friendly that the above three considerations should be allowed their full weight in adjudging the merit of mr hawthornes fourth and longest work of fiction produced after the pause of many years it would be idle to appeal to them were the production which calls them forth not a remarkable oneone of the most remarkable novels that 1860 is likely to give us whether from english french or american sources such an italian tale we have not had since herr andersen wrote his  improvisatore how potent is the spell of the south as filling the memories and quickening the imagination of the stranger how powerless over her own strongest sons in literary works of art and fancy we have occasion to see almost as often as we take up an italian novel mr hawthorne has drunk in the spirit ofitalian beauty at every pore the scene of this romance is principally at rome and the writers intense yearning to reproduce and accumulate his recollections of that wonderful city appears to have again and again possessed itself of heart and pen to the suspense not damage of his story who would object to avait for the progress of passion and the development of mystery on being beckoned aside into such a land of rich and melancholy enchantment as is disclosed in the folloaving exquisite picture of the borghese gardens  the entrance to these grounds as all my readers know for everybody nowa days has been in rome is just outside of the porta del popolo passing beneath that not very impressive specimen of michael angelos architecture a minutes walk will transport the visitor from the small uneasy lava atones of the roman pavement into broad gravelled carriagedrives whence a little farther stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful seclusion a seclusion but seldom a solitude for priest noble and populace stranger and native all who breathe the roman air find free admission and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the daydream that they call life   the scenery amid which the youth now strayed was such as arrays itself in the imagination when we read the beautiful old myths and fancy a brighter sky a softer turf a more picturesque arrangement of venerable trees than we find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the western world the ilextrees southeast ancient and timehonoured were they seemed to have lived for ages undisturbed and to feel no dread of profanation by the axe any more than overthrow by the thunderstroke it had already passed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few years ago they were grievously imperilled by the gauls last assault upon the walls of rome as if confident in the long peace of their lifetime they assumed attitudes of indolent repose they leaned over the green turf in ponderous grace throwing abroad their great branches without danger of interfering with other trees though other majestic trees grew near enough for dignified society but too distant for constraint never was there a more venerable quietude than that which slept among their sheltering boughs never a sweeter sunshine than that now gladdening the gentle bloom which these leafy patriarchs strove to diffuse over the swelling and subsiding lawns in other portions of the grounds the stonepines lifted their dense clump of branches upon a slender length of stem so high that they looked like green islands in the air flinging down a shadow upon the turf so far off that you hardly knew which tree had made it again there were avenues of cypress resembling dark flames of huge funeral candles which spread dusk and twilight round about them instead of cheerful radiance the more open spots were all abloom even so early in the season with anemones of wondrous size both white and rosecoloured and violets that betrayed themselves by their rich fragrance even if their blue eyes failed to meet your own daisies too were abundant but larger than the modest little english flower and therefore of small account these wooded and flowery lawnb are more beautiful than the finest of english parkscenery more touching more impressive through the neglect that leaves nature bo much to her own avays and methods since man seldom interferes with her she sets to work in her own quiet way and makes herself at home there is enough of human care it is true bestowed long ago and still bestowed to prevent wildness from groaving into deformity and the result is an ideal landscape a woodland scene that seems to have been projected out of a poets mind if the ancient faun were other than a mere creation of old poetry and could have reappeared anywhere it must have been in such a scene as this in the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into marble basins the depths of which are shaggy with waterweeds  or they tumble like natural cascades from rock to rock sending their murmur afar to make the quiet and silence more appreciable scattered here and there with careless artifice stand old altars bearing roman inscriptions statues grey with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere half hide and half reveal themselves high on pedestals or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf terminal figures columns of marble or granite porticoes arches are seen in the vistas of the woodpaths either veritable relics of antiquity or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on them that they are better than if really antique at all events grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars and weeds and flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of temples and clamber at large over their pediments as if this were the thousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there what a strange ideawhat a needless labourto construct artificial ruins in rome the nativesoil ofruin buteventhesesportiveimitations wrought by man in emulation of what time has done to temples and palaces are perhaps centuries old and beginning as illusions have grown to be venerable in sober earnest the result of all is a scene pensive lovely dreamlike enjoyable and sad such as is to be found nowhere save in these princely villaresidences in the neighbourhood of rome a scene that must have required generations and ages during which growth decay and mans intelligence wrought kindly together to render it so gently wild as we behold it now the final charm is bestowed by the malaria there is a piercing thrilling delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty thrown away or only

constructions have decried this gorgeous centre of the roman catholic rite as a place mundane theatrical and out of style for such censors art nature and beauty have no existence save by the complacent favour of their own vanity we have inadvertently touched on the great scenic power and beauty of this italian romance ere offering a word on its matter and argument whether the elevating influences of remorse on certain natures have ever been taken as the theme of a story so fearlessly as here may be questioned casuists and moralists must discuss the truth of the data to mr hawthorne truth always seems to arrive through the medium of his imaginationsome faroff fantasy to suggest a train of thought and circumstance out of which philosophies are evolved and characters grow his hero the count of monte beni would never have lived had not the faun of praxiteles stirred the authors admiration and this mythical creature so engaged the dreamers mind that he draws out of the past the fancy of an old family endowed with certain constant attributes of sylvan gaiety and careless semianimal enjoyments such as belonged to the dances and sunshine of arcady such is donatello at the beginning of the tale and with these qualities are mixed up unquestioning simple love and fidelity which can take a form of unreasoning animal fury in a moment of emergency he is hurried into sudden murder for thesake of the woman he loves and with that the faun nature dies out and the sad consciencestricken human being begins in the writhings of pain to think to feellastly to aspire this in a few words is the meaning of  transformation and for the first moiety of the romance the story tums slowly with windings clearly to be traced yet poaverfully round its principal figure the other

fairy tales by mark lemon bradbury evans and co 187i under the above title messrs bradbury evans and co have reproduced along with that most charming of forner christmas books  tinykins transformations two other less wellknown but most elegant draughts upon the imagination of the late editor of punch with respect to our old friend tinykin we must remind our readers that although the scene of the tale is fairyland still that fairyland lies in tilgate forest a part of sussex with which mr lemon was familiar on account of his lonf residence within a drive of its outskirts we will not give our readers more than just a hint about its contents because we do not wish to anticipate the pleasure with which julia will dilate her large blue eyes and the glee with which little alice will clap her hands when they see titania and her little carpenters sawing in the wood and the guards of the fishbarons castle swimming about in the shape of fairy lobsters and the host of little tilgate fairies dancingaroundtheir beloved queen not less elegant in their way are the elfin horse and the gnomeking towards the end of the tale but best of all perhaps are the vignettes of the banqueting tables and the tiny musicians in the gnome kings palace on pages 1589 and that of tinykin transformed into a mole and pricked in the rear by the sharp points of the lances and swords of the little fairy imps who figure as the gnome police as for tinykin himself like proteus the old man of the sea in the fourth georgic of virgil he omnia transformat seize in miracula rerum but how he became in turn a bird a mole a bat and a fish and how in the end as uluf the son of thomas the verderer of tilgate he fell in love with the fairy daughter of the king and lived happily ever aftenvards we must leave to be told in mr lemons owvn words the scene of the story we should observe is laid in the reign of good king horsa when the fairies may be supposed to have had it nearly all their own way in the forest and woodlands of the west saxons we will only add that a summer day in tilgate forest is a very pleasant thing indeed but we think our young friends in the schoolroom will almost prefer a few hours of the holidays in the company of tinykin and mr markl lemon whose imagi native powers have found mr charles green an admirable interpreter in the chronicles of the three sisters which follow next we have the story of a  noble baron who shows his nobility by squandering away his money and estates and living like a prince and who is profoundly dissatisfied with the domestic management of his wvife and daughters and accordingly getting into all sorts of troubles he sees two of his three daughters married to a bear and an eagle respectively while a huge sea monsterwe can hardly call him a fishruns off with the mniru and tney pass into a state which to say the least is not that of ave rage humanity however the3 are won back to their larents by a younger brother rinaldo who isborn grows up to manhood dons the arms of knighthood and sallies forth upon adventures the end of the story is thus tolda whole year passed away in sports and festivities at last the princes considered that a continuance of these indulgences would enervate the courage and activity of their knights and squires the three sonsinlaw therefore with their ladies took their departure for their respective homes riccaldo the heir of the family never quitted his parents and at last like a pious son closed their eyes albert the bear bought the domain of ascania and founded the city bernberg edgar the eagle retired to switzerlandunder the shadow of the lofty alps and founded eagleton on the banks of a river which had then no name but is now called after the city by which it glides ugo the dolphin undertook an expedition into burgundy conquered part of that kingdom and named it dauphin6 and as the three princes in the names of their cities and states alluded to the circumstance of their enchantment they also took their own enchanted shapes for the devices of their arms thence bernberg carries a bear with a golden crowr eagleton an eagle and dauphine a fish as a device to this day it should be added that for a profusion of graceful illustrations this story is indebted to the pencil of air c h bennett the third story that of the enchanted doll has tow additional claims on our attention firstly it teaches a high moral lesson that of checking all envious feelings an secondly its scene is laid in london partly at  kilboune near the old priory there and partly in the city how the gift of an enchanted doll is made the vehicle of conveying this lesson to a selfish and grasping londoner we will leave mr mark lemon to tell our readers in his own words for fear that his publishers should think that wve have been poaching on his and their manor and preserves we owe them our best thanks for allowving us to transfer to our pages two of the illustrations of this beautiful and really charming volume viz that of the fairies dancing in a ring round their beloved queen  from tinvkins tranformations by mr c green and that of the enchanted doll being shaped into form by a swann of little fairies in the artists workshop it is quite a masterpiece in it way and equal to anything that we have seen ven from the pencil of ar richard doyle the special artist of the fairies and fairyland  fairy tales by hans christian andersen illustrated by e v b london sampson low marston low and searle every one is now more or less acquainted with andersens delightful tales in which the fantastic the poetical and the grotesque are blended with such artistic harmony but few are prepared to see the selection of eight of the prettiest stories in the splendid binding fine text and original illustrations of this truly handsome volume the twelve large chromolithographs are treated in the bright and somewhat crude colouring which has latterly been so much en vogme and seems at this season of the year especially to supersede the quieter woodcuts and engravings of former days the quaintness of this florid style is however peculiarly adapted to the subject it is most conspicuous in the picture of the wicked princess in her garden which is almost weird in its conception so much so indeed that it all but precludes the possibility of its being intended to grace a childs book not so the one of the  children playing in the water which is full of life and grace while the two interiors of the  ugly duckling and the  witch combing gerdas hair have quite a flemish finish of detail on the whole we incline to believe that the  fairy tales is more a drawingfoom album than a volume for little people whose meddlesome fingers should not be allowed to dogear its handsome pages although no doubt a glimpse of its bright beauties would be an exquisite treat as they could not fail to recognise their old friends in their brilliant new christmas garb  faint tales eooks ron childuint by mark lemon with upwards of fifty illustrations by richard doyle and charles h bennett bradbury evans  co mr lemon has already ventured among the fairies and stood on enchanted ground he has made two more journeys in the same direction and to little people of mortal mould gives the fruits of bis experience or of his invention yet not entirely of either for his first story the chronicles of the three sisters is from the german the original author of it was not much of a conjurer if there is any moral in the story which shows how three daughters of a baron came to marry a bear an eagle and a fish and that these turned out to be princes it is that sonsinlaw may not be such beasts as they look the grandest piece of magic in the story is at the service of every individual who may stand in need of it and a knowledge thereof may be profitable to many a person suffering froma baroness indulging in bitterest reproaches the baron had recourse to his invariable practice in all conjugal altercations and observed a profound silence suffer ing the lady to proceed until she was tired mr lemon does not say whether his second story the enchanted doll is original or overset from the german he does however very soon settle a point in fairy chronology for he tells us that the story    happened years ago long before the fairies had left us as we find that tony stubbs one of the characters distinguished for his ability in chasing gold and silver  had gone over the sea as far as florence to study in the workshop of the great benvenuto cellini we learn that the fairies were alive and active at least as late as the middle of the sixteenth century be this as it may the enchanted doll is a better story than  the chronicle of the three sisters and it may teach a good many of us how to get rid of the very black doll which sorely besets some men,novel_contra

the school for fathers an old english storv by t gwynne london smith elder and co cornhill 1852 the tale is admirably told the moral excellent and thc characters are truthfully yet spiritedly drawn the events recorded are supposed to have transpired some century or so ago in the days of powder and swords and the plot is simple and may be conveyed in a few words sir thomas warren a man of pleasure and a courtier having been employed for ten years in a diplomatic capacity abroad returns unexpectedly to england and finding himself from a variety of causes incapable of pursuing the course of life in which he has been hitherto indulging determines to occupy himself in the education of his son whom he has hitherto sadly neglected now his son jack has been residing from his infancy in thc remote corner of a midland county with his uncle squire warren a fine specimen of thc foxhunter of that period in character habits and conversation he reminds us forcibly of old sir roger de coverley aud consequently presents a striking contrast to his foppish and effeminate brother living under bis roof partaking in all his amusements and pursuits jack had become the precise counterpart of his worthy relative at thc epoch when he is introduced to us he is  rising nineteen over six feet in height hale hearty and robust a keen sportsman shy and ungainly in his manners generous and warmhearted but somewhat inclined to obstinacy and in intellect not over bright at the time when his father arrives with the intention of carrying him off to london to educate him  wiore suorum jack finds himself most unpleasantly circumstanced in consequence of an attachment bc had long since formed with the fair daughter of thc vicar lydia freeman a young belle whose bright eyes have inflamed the hearts of more than one admirer fearing an angry refusal in case he should seek his fathers consent to their union he determines to brusque matters and accordingly first obtains the young ladys consent aud then informs his parent to his astonishment sir thomas offers no opposition to the match provided thc weddingday is postponed for a couple of years as he fully anticipates that long ere then an introduction to london life with all its concomitants will have eradicated this  boyish fancy poor jack arrives in london and finds himself suddenly immersed in gaieties for which he has no taste dissipations that he abhors compelled as he is at the same time to forego all his wonted pursuits and to submit to the severest discipline while he is forced te acquire accomplishments that only render him still more awkward in his demeanour and more ludicrous in his appearance sir thomas having resolved that jack should marry a lady of fortune takes much pains to effect his introduction to an eligible individual of that denomination this excites the jealousy of a host of rivals for though jack remains undeviatingly true to his  little lydia he is compelled by bis unreasonable father to make some show of  attention  to the captivating widow fairfax now it so happens that one colonel pcnruddock has already determined to win and wear her like many others of her sex under similar circumstances out of caprice the lady pretends to admire jack greatly though she has secretly predetermined to give her hand to the colonel they meet at an evening party  tins insult colonel penruddocks malignant glance was on him hatred contempt and jealousy gleamed in his eye that very morning mistress fairfax had carelessly saidon pur pose of coursethat she never beheld so fine a man as mr warrenthat be possessed so artless yet so fascinating a mode of paying his addresses she was sure no heart could resist him then she leaned her cheek on her hand looked absent sighed and allowed the colonel to address her twice before she appeared to know that he had done so at all the colonel threw himself into one of his most violent tornadoes and rushed out of the house the widow tapped ber chin approvingly with her fan surveyed her charming face in thc glass laughed hummed an opera tune and went to the auction tiie colonel had not condescended so much as to bow to her on the evening in question when he saw jack proceeding towards her the muscles of his thin face worked nervously he placed himself in the way and as jack approached leaned his hand on though back of a chair and advanced his right foot directly in jacks path jack hurrying  to qct it over perceived not the guardsmans movement isle drew near the colonel contracting every muscle held bis foot firmly planted jack tripped the colonel smiled a ghastly smile had jack been lighter or more active he would have tripped and recovered himself but the poor fellow was neither he tripped stumbled ran two or three paces forward and fell prostrate at the widows feet good manners were totally forgotten and a titter which grew to a laugh salutedjacks misfortune sir thomas swore and fumed jack arose anger and indignation chased shyness and mauvaue honte from his soul everything around bim seemed to whirl and totter he heard the laughter he felt the insult ke strode up to colonel penruddock like a young hercules and in a loud clear voice he shouted  was that on purpose or by accident  on purpose replied the colonel bowing and then drawing himself up to his utmost height  then take that 1 roared jack and doubling his fist he drew it back to his shoulder then straitening bis arm with the iron strength of a gladiator he struck the colonel on though face with the whole might of his thick muscular arm the colonel reeled and fell crushing a chair in his tall au the mun present rushed towards him the laughter was hushed penruddock arose with an oat the blood streaming from his face several ladies fell into  hysteric affections  and faintings but the gentlemen being all occupied round jack and the colonel they soon recovered their senses sir thomas drew his son away from penruddock anger and disgust stamped upon his features this unpleasant incident of course gives rise to a duel which is so admirably described that we cannot refrain from quoting it the duel there had been a slight fall of snow during the night which only partially covered the ground though shrill thin voice of thc sweep and though rolling of a few heavy dust carts were the predominating sounds the air was damp and penetrating the atmosphere murky and dull and beginning to bo charged with the smoke of early fires though shops were unopenedfew passengers abroadhere and there a workman proceeding to his work pipe

surgeon who attended the colonel was equally struck with him egad sir what a grenadier hed make he said to captain richmond  i should ask nothing better than to command a battalion of the same sort was the reply jack and the colonel began their duel under very different feelings jack was determined not to hurt the colonel but merely to parry his thrusts he had no ill will towards him and no feeling for duels the colonel on the other hand felt that he was opposed to a rival and a man who had insulted him and put bim in a ridiculous position beneath the very eyes of his mistress his soul was bitter with hatred und revenge and he swore that cither jack or himself must die that day after a short  bout seeing jacks play he dropped the point of his sword and cried with flashing eyes and angry voice  i will not be treated like a child sir fight fairly and attack me as well as defend yourself jack obeyed and presently his bright sword entered penruddocks right breast fortunately for him the point slipped along one of the ribs instead of penetrating between them and anon though fight was renewed the swords wound about each other like lightningthc clear light clashing peculiar to the small sword only to be rightly explained by the word ucliquetis was the only sound heard jack received a wound in the thick of the arm but acquitted himself very well never lost bis coolness or temper aud gave the colonel a great deal to do still the swords clashed and glittered seconds and surgeons breathless with interest knew not on which of the combatants to pronounce at last penruddock

belforest a tale of english country life new novels  by the author of mary powell c 2 vols bentley few writers have a better oyo than the author of  mary powell for discerning all that is picturesque in domestic ufo there are no characters perhaps in  belforest that may not be met with in our everyday experienceno incidents that would be considered very extraordinary even in the quiet circles of a country village but the figures are carefully drawn and the grouping is skilfully managed so that every portion of the picture is effective although it is composed of homely materials the author has evidently bestowed a good deal of thought on artistic subjects and she carries out with her pen the principles that she would recommend to those who work with the brush and palette her first rule we should imagine is to go to nature for models her second to select from among natural objects those which are pleasing and reject those which are rough and coarse her third to make an harmonious arrangement of the various tints and to throw a genial warmth over the whole there are many other kinds of art besides this but this is by no means a bad kind moreover it is essentially womanly and ladylike womanly because it is gentle and unassuming and does not aspire to heroics and ladylike because it is always refined and disdains to borrow  humours from the stable and pothouse the scene of  belforest is laid in a retired village untainted with suburban innovations but near enough to london to be within a walk of the dulwich gallery here wo find a young artist leonard antony lodging at the village postoffice and sketching everything in the neighbourhood whether living or inanimate nessy saffery the postmasters little daughterwho is esteemed a young lady of property on the strength of possessing an annuity of thirty poundsaspires to be initiated into the mysteries of art and it is ludicrous to contemplate the horror of the london zeuxis when asked to give lessons to the child of a village grocer nor is it less amusing to behold the blank dismay of miss saffery when leonard antony persuaded at last to undertake the charge sets her to draw straight lines on a piece of inillbuard though pour child has been fondly imagining that she is to start with a grund subject and a bright glow of colouring that she is to commence at once on a glorious work of art such as that on which mr antony himself is engaged the sudden fall to something little better than pothooks is terrible and nessys irrepressible anger nearly creates a fatal breach between the singular allies this quarrel between the clever and sarcastic young man and the demure little girl of thirteen makes a very amusing scene and it ends in a compromisemiss saffery being permitted to handle the brush a little while she graciously consents to use the chalk and millboard a good deal in avery short time she makes rapid progress the village magnates purchase her rustic sketches and even her instructor nods approval from his lofty pedestal however she is not intended to be a painterat least not in the present work perhaps the author intends to give us a continuation as nessy is not yet married or even in love and there are one or two other threads that might be taken up but  belforest has its own share of the romance of life apart from nessy several of the characters have a comic vein and the dialogue often causes a hearty laugh without ever becoming vulgar,novel_contra
  the hidden path by miss harland i london knight and sons clerkenwell close it is now more than twelve months since this book was issued from the press of j c derby new york it was the second venture of the author her former publication alone having introduced her name to the public that work has reached the fourteenth edition in america and has been received with still more popularity in europe this although published under most disadvantageous circumstances with but little effort put forth for its circulation by its own merits has gained for itself and author a most prominent position the success of miss harlands former work had aroused the public expectation for the reception of  the hidden path so that we were not surprised to learn that only four weeks from the date of its publication fourteen thousand copies had been sold at a period in which the labours of the printing office have surpassed those of the factory and the hum of the press drowned the noise of the millwheel when so many volumes yearly find their way into society which seldom outlive one edition a work must possess something of more than ordinary attractiveness to meet with such a welcome the efforts of the publishers may accomplish much in bringing a work into notice and yet if it have not real merit it cannot stand before the fire of criticism which every book of our time must bear before its acceptance the very favourable notices attending the introduction of this work have commended it to our homes and hearts there are several characteristics of  the hidden path worthy of observation the author has brought us a picture of real life her story is not the highly painted romance whose greatest attraction is the wondrous scenes through which the hero of the tale is led nor has she gone out of the circle of society to find one whose peculiar lot has been a catalogue of extravagant circumstances which though boldly narrated demand an imagination equal to that of the author to follow the power of  the hidden path is the naturalness of its design so resembling our own experience of life so similar to what would be our conclusion regarding those whom she introduces to us that the mind finds it difficult to dispossess itself of the idea that this is a simple narrative a hearthistory having its counterpart elsewhere than in the fancy of the writer we know the cbaracters as we read they become our familiar friends and we look with as much interest at every circumstance and influence affecting their destiny as if they had been bound to us by the most intimate ties this is the highest style of romance if we are to have books which are to be the conveyors of practical truth and all the books we read should have this tendency we do not ask for those whose very improbability counteracts their design but books whose teachings find a response in the common sense of every mind and in the pure affections of the heart then it is that fiction steps out of its sphere becoming only the medium of illustration the instrument by which fancy weaves bright pictures upon the web of truth so nearly like the original as almost to cause us doubt whether indeed they are feigned the principle the base of all is truth  and imagination only suggests the course of action which would re sult from this we pronounce that a vitiated tastea taste corrupted by dealing with the monstrous and improbable which demands something bold even if it be the boldness of falsehood  yet we are not to be mistaken as condemning originality of thought or expres sion but we have yet to learn that a work may not be characteristic and a book of mark and yet be faithful to life in the circle of society with which we are familiar how few along the pilgrimage we are walking present anything strikingly peculiar in the aspect of their life how few have moved in an eccentric sphere out dazzling their companions and yet in the beautiful sentiment of our author each one may have some peculiar hearthistory unknown to the world he may be walking a hidden path in which he sees only gods hand pointing the way we can scarcely give an abstract of the work in the short space allowed us  and yet an epitome of the story is necessary to our review the opening act conveys us to a scene in the  old dominion where the heroine is intro duced to us as bella conway she is then a girl of eleven diffident and reserved but mature beyond her years and one in whom the traits of womanhood are already beginning distinctly to develop bellas mother after a widowhood of five years is married to mr snowden a man who beneath a polished address and christian profession carries the heart of a villain this wolf in sheeps clothing begins a series of per secutions upon bella and her younger brother jamie a crippled child hitherto the pet of the household which results in chilling the heart of the mother and driving her daughter from home separated from all that she once loved she is sent to philadelphia to school but here in the family of her uncle mr oakley she finds a home and companionship in which the years of her exile are made happy it is here we are introduced to characters who play a conspicuous part in the latter scenes of the story maurice a son of mr oakley and then a theological student and his sister isabel noble in high souled intellect and more noble in heart scarcely less a heroine than she whose path they bless these by their fraternal kindness and sympathy find entrance to bellas heart and by the magic of their love heal its broken strings after an absence of two years she returns to virginia more unwelcome than before for in her absence her property which had been committed in trust to her uncle mysteriously disappears and she is thrown upon the charities of her stepfather with an independent spirit bella resolves again to leave her home to sustain herself by teaching here she takes another step into that blind way in which duty alone is the guide she accepts a situation as instructress in the family of mr norwood a man of the stamp frequently found in refined society whose highest ideas of education extend only to the power of display the pharisee of the present i day the unobtrusive and silent manners of bella are not adapted to his ideal and therefore at the end of the first year she quits her post for the situation of subteacher in a female seminary after submitting to the privations and persecutions of a boardingschool life for a twrm she receives an invitation to the position of english teacher in a school in ric mond there for a few months the homeless wanderer seems once more at rest for in addition to the more congenial associations of her new position she enjoys the society of her betrothed williard monmiouth the playmate of her youth and now a junior partner of a mercantile house in the city even this calm is the precursor of a storm more violent than any other which has wrecked the poor girls hopes monmouth ambitious for wealth and distinction amid the excitement of gay life becomes wearied of the unpretending simplicity which concealed the noble heart of her whom he had heretofore loved and longs for one better adapted to the brilliant sphere in which he would move this he finds in the person of a miss berkeley whose fascinating address and reputed wealth win his false heart from his first love the iron trammels of love and honour which he throws off for the golden chain fall upon the heart of the deserted one and crush it to the earth for what weight can bear so heavily upon the soul as rejected affection under this weight of sorrow she pursues unmurmuringly that path which providence seems pointing out although it is hidden in mysteries and every step in the deepening shades manifests a heroism of faith at the invitation of her friends in philadelphia she removed thither again to make her home in the family of her uncle here she remains among those who appreciating her worth and sympathising in her griefs lighten the load of sorrow and restore her in some degree to the happiness of other days after a residence of two years with these she is remanded to her home in virginia by the illness of her mother then sinking into the grave forgetting the chilling neglect of the past like a ministering angel she hovers around the couch of her dying parent consoling and sustaining by her presence the last moments of the sufferer her patient sorrow at last meets its reward maurice oakley now the occupant of the mooresville parsonage whose affectionate tenderness had soothed the poignancy of her deepest grief comes to claim her as his bride and at the bedside of her dying mother she hears the vows which unite her for life to one worthy of her noble heart we suppose it may be taken for granted that every author who sends us a living book one into which he has thrown his whole soul and feelingsfor such a production is  the hidden pathhas a design beyond that of entertainment or of tracing out the joys and sorrows of the heros life this though often lost sight of by the novelreader whose criterion of literary worth is merely that of the passing effect and of the good or bad endingthis remembered becomes to us the key which opens to us new interests and treasures of beapty it gives us a familiarity with the characters of the drama and we behold each one in his turn performing some part in the design and though trivial his place and words may be yet leading on to the completion an indispensable link in the plan when this moral is discovered every separate incident has its connexion with the grand truth which is illustrated and is thus invested with new beauty as a reflector of the light that shines upon it the hidden path is an experimental illustration of the passage i will bring the blind by a way that they know not i will lead them in paths that they have not known it is impossible that a book with such a design inculcating high moral and religious principle should be other than beneficial in its effect there is no doubtful or double meaning whose tendencies may be misconstrued but a healthful tone pervading every chapter if there is a faithful portrayal of the evil in our nature it is not glossed over lby heroic deeds which cause us to regard the villain with deeper interest than his victim nor is it such as presents a morbid misanthropic view of humanity but it shows evil as it generally exists the index of a wicked heart and by its bright and beautiful contrasts makes that which is truly worthy the more love able the book has its faults but these are minor and not such as affect its moral bearing or success as a work of genius there is an oc casional extravagance of passion and of lan guage exceeding at times the natural emotion which would be excited by the circumstances such a passage we detect in one of the early chapters of the book when bella overheard the mteatete conversation between mr snowden and her mother  the truthto her a dreadful revelationburst upon the poor child her mother was to be married and to a man against whom her soul had arisen in abhorrence at first sight jealousy cruel as the grave for an instant was the pervading emotion then keen and bitter resentment against the loathed usurper as she remembered her frail crippled brother hitherto the darling most cared for by all the household cheated out of a coveted caresson this the very night of her returnby the glozing foidlings of a lover was this an earnest of what the future held for him  shaking with horror and passion she made her way back to jamies room it seems to us that this height of passion ascribed to a child of eleven years whose dislike had arisen only from a prejudice created an hour before is unnatural it is probable that she would learn these intimations with sorrow and experience an increasing dislike for the intruder but we think the expression  shaking with horror and passion somewhat extravagant and forced lve notice this tendency in other passages of the work yet we can see throughout this a decided improvement upon the former writings of miss harland this with a proneness to magrniloquence or rather the use of a composite word where a simpler expression would convey the meaning are the only defects which we would suggest as worthy of correction in the style but we would like to speak at large upon the power and beauty of that style combining excellences seldom equalled in no case excelled among the writers of the present day the tendency to foreign terms noticeable in  alone is not found here but a purity of language and felicity of illustration more to be admired because manifesting an advance in this respect if the book does not possess the same chain of brilliant incidents as miss harlands former production it has for the discerning mind more of the truly beautiful and as a volume far surpasses that in all that makes a work excellent its humour is inimitable its pathos simple and touching its conversation easy and natural its descriptions and panegyrics thrilling there are many passages worthy of praise which none can read without emotion and others which cause a thrill to pass through the whole frame such is the reverie of isabel as she sits through the long night by the cold hearthstone pouring out the wail of a forsaken heart chapter twentyfourth the description of the railroad collision in the thirtieth chapter brings the whole scene vividly before our eyes with isabel we see the darting of the fire breathing monsters hear the clash of death and the moans of the suffering and dying these are but a few illustrations from the hidden path  but it abounds with them every sen timent of isabel and frank and maurice de serves mention but we have already trespassed beyond our bounds the hidden path is worthy of a place in every home circle and its pure sentiments a dwellingplace in every heart as a virginia production it does credit to the state in which so many of its scenes are laid and from whose homes so many of its characters are drawn  the hidden path by marion harland low  uothis is an improvement upon the authors last story of alone reviewed by us on its appearance there is more pith and consistency in the plot and very much less fine writingfewer provincialisms both of thought and

fiction the voice of the people by ellen glasgow heinemann 6s phases of an inferior planet was a clever book and this book is both clever and very ambitiousas every novel must be ambitious which pretends to embrace the whole life of a man from the cradle to the grave the fault of the voice of the people is that it is too long we do not mean that its length is excessive in any absolute sense nor that the author digresses unduly from the theme which she has set herself nor do we mean that the book is dull it never is dull we mean that much of it is unimportant and inessential in the pretty and diverting scenes of white and black life at sleepy kingsborough the home of nick burr that born lawyer and politician and state governor this triviality of observation is especially felt it has a weakening effect on the story as a whole the original projective force of an author is strictly limited by nature and if the author tries to spread that force over too large an area the result must be in a measure to render it futile miss glasgows faculty of observation needs discipline it is too busy too fussy and a great deal too fancifulfanciful where it should be imaginative she often does not observe the right kind of thing she trifles and gives rein to mere fancy and gradually she passes into a condition a mood which without conscious intent twists and contorts life into something untruthfully erettysomething emasculate and feebly emotional when er hero and heroine approach the passionate climax of their lives this is what occurs according to miss glasgow then by a curious emotional phenomenon she seemed to be suddenly invested with the glory of the sunset the goldenrod burned at her feet and on her bosom and her fervent blood leapt to her face the next moment he staggered like a man blinded by too much light  the fieldtwith eugenia rising in its midst flamed before his eyes and he put out his hand like one in pain  what is it p  she asked quickly and nor voioe seemed a part of the general radiance  you have been looking at the sun it hurts my eyes  no he answered steadily  i was looking at you she thrilled as he spoke and brought her eyes to the level of his then she would have looked away but his gaze held her and she made a sudden movement of alarm a swift tremor to escape she held the sheaf of goldenrod t her bosom and above it her eyes shone her breath came quickly between her parted lips all her changeful beauty was startled into life  genia he sid softly so softly that he seemed speaking to himself  genia   this may be truth but it is truth falsified scarcely recognisable beneath its envelope of fanciful and quasimaudlin  intensity we insist on this aspect of miss glasgows novel because it is characteristic of much modern fiction the writers of such fiction should undergo a course of balzac in many respects the voice of the people is admirable the style is generally distinguished and the dialogue though too plentiful is lifelike and effective the sketches of negro character are excellent miss glasgow has a wide knowledge of life and manners the novel seems to be her true vocation and one is bound to accord to her that serious consideration which is only accorded to a serious artist  the voice of the people by ellen glasgow a story of american life by the author of phases of an inferior planet we watch the heros career from farmers boy to judge  there arnt nothin in peanutraisin  is nick burrs early conviction he accounted a judges career  cleaner work the story is a strong commentary on the lynching practises which are the disgrace of certain states of america heinemann 6s   the voice of the people by ellen glas gow heinemann 1 the voice of the people  is by a comparatively new writer the trend and matter of the actual story are not of any particularly notable nor distinctive kind they deal with the career of an ambitious highsouled rustic a boy who from nothing reaches a position of importance in his native state the hopes despairs successes and failures and other vicissitudes that meet him on his path are described with some vividness but there is more than this to attract the reader and more especially those with a liking for tales of the southern american states these latter are a happy hunting ground for clever novelists across the atlantic since  the open question and a book by mrs burnett we do not remember any story with so fine a southern setting and background for character as this where it is not plot and incident it is a series of bright soft pictures of nature itself of luxuriant gardens and of people instinct with droll or lovable peculiarities the life of the old virginian landowners the negro servants their quaint ways their outspoken freedom of speech yet exceeding loyalty to marse this or mis that are individually as well as traditionally excellent one feels the genuine human nature of old general battle who keeps open house of a ruined and ruinous kind also the sister who takes the reins of government and the charming little daughter auntverbeny uncle ish delphy and her meek soninlaw mose are also admirable so is the household of judge bassett and so in another way are the hardworking family of the ambitious poorwhite  hero the farmstead and the harsh yet kind stepmother and her chronic neuralgy all these persons places and things are excellent because beneath the impressionist touch of miss glasgow there is a solid hold on average human nature we perceive this in many matters in the relations between the general and his daughter and in a sense of an underlying unforced pathos in passing people and inanimate objects around them the group of happy irresponsible children is charmingly drawn then there are the sayings and doings of the black people often comical to a high degree indeed uncle ish his dignified almost injured attitude towards the kind human ravens who supply his daily bread is most amusing the story is divided into books we prefer the earlier parts but the interest is on the whole well maintained  the voice of the people bv elen glamow 6s heinemann the north may have the greatest output of

sunny clime are described in a very leisurely fashion we linger willingly among them miss glasgow is a writer of exceptional power she knows human nature and while here she dwells by preference among the more amiable specimens of it she does not shirk sterner realities indeed the story of her central character is so full of pain that we somewhat resent her inexorable treatment of him at least we resent her indulgent feelings to eugenia the prosperous young woman who wounded nicholas sorely married his rival and took his tragic death a little too placidly in the end among these comfortable charming folks the personality and career of nicholas have an added pathos the hardused struggler with the strong will the clear brain the inexorable conscience and the heart that is always

bailey the danbury newsman and carefully compiled with a pair of eightdollar shears by the compiler boston us shepard  gill the above elaborate titlepage is something like the painted canvas outside a show at a fair it gives a foretaste of the entertainment within and the clown cuts a joke with the visitor who has paid his money and passes inward just inside the threshold mr bailey himself has a word to say with each of his generous public his theme treats of the motives which induce the world of authors to write and he airs his wit by remarking it is not for me to judge the world unless i am elected therewith he hopes certain persona  may find relief in his book  although it ia extremely doubtful and he addsif in its perusal one single or even married borrower is made purer and better and his life made to appear brighter and his soul lifted up generally i shall sincerely rejoice to hear it this is a sort of keynote to the volume and from it some idea may be gathered of the samples of american humour to be found in the volume itself some of the samples are odd and others are extravagant we class among the former the boy who nearly lost the entire use of one eye by constantly revolving it around in search of an unfriendly faction of boys  also the dissipated lad who witnessed all the funeral ceremonies he could on a sunday because being surrounded with puritanical influences at home the sabbath was dreary to him  the horses are as odd as the lads one of the former  would get up from a meal at delmonicos to kick the president of the united states  and another was such a bolter that in a tight pinch he would run away from a position in the new york custom house no little portion of what is supposed to be humour in this volume consists in the extravagance of some of its descriptions it is said for instance of a quakeress her gesture is not graceful it is just such a motion as a person would undoubtedly acquire who had executed a contract to push fifteen hundred boys down two flights of stairs now and then there is a touch of description something better as in the following of walt whitman   walt whitman is writing more of his poetry the last is an ode to america he intelligently observes what if that gift ot gift thou lackst the perfect feminine of thee the beauty health completion flt for thee the mothers flt for thee and here he stops not a word of how the battle resulted but just drops down and leaves the reader to imagine the result this is the secret of his success his stops make him popular the more he stops the more popular he becomes if he should stop altogether the public would give him a monument and perhaps a horse after about a hundred and fifty pages of oddity and extravagance which become exceedingly dull and wearisome we arrive at the close of the first part there is much justification for sayingfor this relief much thanks and we entirely agree with one of mr baileys enunciations of wisdom   all things have an end and this dreary performance was not an exception the second part is in the form of  letters these are improvements on the supposed wit and humour of the first portion here is something reasonable in one of these epistles  there is a commodore in say brook who used to be a very distinguished person in the merchant service many years ago he was master of the duke of northumberland one of the handsomest and staunchest vessels in the line he was a captain in those days when to be a captain of a vessel was better than to be a god in a heathen town of eight thousand inhabitants but now his sailing days are over and he has sunk to the level of a commodore he has a nice place and a lot of barns on one of these a onestory affair ia perched the figurehead of the duke of northumberland being a colossal figure in wood of a dead white colour and not the least approach to levity in any of its lineaments there is a peculiar sensation in watching this incongruous spectaclea little yellow barn and a towering piece of sculp tare on its summit there stands the duke with his pants in his boots as was the greeleyism of a century ago looking off toward the ocean and thinking how different things are now from what they were when he was a boy this is a very painful thought but very instructive it is years since the dake left the oceanlong weary rearsbut if he could speak if the inanimate wood could only speak what wondrous stories it would tell of the wharfairs it has passed through there is a good deal of strength in this thought the last division of the book is under the heading of  local items they consist of maxims axioms and of illustrations of danbury life in love business and politics for example this among many others a prominent badge of american citizenship appears to be a soiled shirt with gold studs politics present themselves in these items somewhat eccentrically thus we hear of an anxious boardinghouse keeper who inquires  if when a woman has the right to vote she can be made to pay as much board as a man  these matters are copiously illustrated so copiously indeed that the reader is fain to cry  hold enough  but the author has his own way and he illustrates it in a remark to this effect he knows he tells us as well as anybody  how bitterly opposed the american people as a class are to receiving knowledge but i will give them he adds valuable information when they dont know it and they never will know it ill do it so adroitly in many instances this is indisputable,novel_contra

  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust that it has gone far enough to attract readers to a book which i am myself loth to lay down george cotterell,novel_contra

rodent corner by henry seton merri man smith elder  co henry seton merrimans new story turns upon the development and extension of an industry which levies a terrible toll on human life malgamite  an essential in the manufacture of paper the company is promoted under the clever disguise of a philanthropic scheme by one of those archvillains who flourish so abundantly in fiction but are fortunately seldom met with in real life von holzens villainies are discovered and he himself is finally brought to bay by one tony cornish a sophisticated gentleman of fashion whose good blood has the remarkably original faculty of not failing him on emergency this quality appears to be one of the authors discoveries at any rate it contributes to the stock of epigrams of varying degrees of triteness which in this book even more than in some of the writers previous works go far towards obstructing the course of an otherwise excellent story for the plot is as dexterously contrived and manipulated as in any former romance by the same hand and if the characters continue to smack of limelight and stagelight generally they can play their parts adequately enough for the purpose the malgamite works are set up in a dreary corner of the dutch coast by von holzen and his ally a more incomplete villain who gives his name to the book the spot is chosen as being sufficiently remote from the fashionable philanthropists and others who have joined the company in london on the understanding that the process of malgamite manufacture is henceforth to be transformed from a poisonous into a safe and wholesome industry the truth lies however rather in the contrary direction and tony cornish whose eyes have been opened to it conveys the hapless collection of workpeople to the spot with the determination of exposing the villainous but profitable scheme of von holzen and percy roden the descrip  tion of the doomed and already haltpoisoned malgamiteworkers brought over to the new works is vivid and forcible  who are they at any ratethese hundred and twenty ghosts of men asks a sailor on board the ship which lands them in holland  the malgamite workers filed offa sorry crew narrowchested holloweyed with that halfhopeless halfreckless air that tells of a close familiarity with disease and death he cornish nodded to them airily as they passed him some of them took the trouble to answer his salutation others seemed indifferent few seemed to take an interest in their surroundings they exchanged no comments but walked side by side in silencedumb and driven animals some of them bore signs of disease a few stumbled as they went one or two were halfblind with groping handsone shadow lay over them allthe shadow of death today when public attention is being turned to the unwholesome industries this description is likely to attract attention the remainder of the story is played out in holland cornishs determination to defeat and expose von holzen results in more than one fight for his life these stirring scenes of action afford the author the opportunity for the display of his best powers which lie in the direction of rapid action tangible episodes and the description of that which is perceptible to the outward rather than to the inward eye roden has a sister of very different calibre from himself whose presence at scheveningen cheers cornish on his way while it complicates his retributive action there are other persons of the feminine gender who play more or less prominent niles in the story but these only serve to emphasise the fact that the intricacies of human character and of womans character in particular are somewhat outside this writers scope dogmatize as he will on the subject the story ends in the triumph of the right cause and of the happy lover it will certainly satisfy the admirers of the authors former books while it does nothing to change the impression of those who found him before to be an excellent craftsman as regards plots but decidedly wanting in many of those subtle qualities and refinements which go to the making of a great writer or a literary artist,novel_contra
a tramps sketches the soul of a tramp by stephen graham macmil lan and co 5s net this book is a record of a walk along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and of a pilgrimage to jerusalem it differs markedly from most books of travel however in that the author is less concerned with the things seen along the line of route than with his own spiritual emotions and experiences as he himself says it is not so much a book about russia as about the tramp mr graham is among those who find salvation by going out into the wilderness he reminds one at times of thoreau there is the same impatience with the meaningless restraints of civilisation the same wild exuberant delight in the freedom of nature but whereas thoreaus withdrawal from the world had bred in him a certain scorn of humanity mr graham is overflowing with the milk of human kindness he finds friends everywhereamong the peasants of the russian steppes in eastern monasteries or turkish bazaars thoreau was alike by conviction and temperament a pagan the tone and temper of mr grahams book on the other hand are those of the christian so one is not surprised at the note of blitheness that runs through these pages often footsore the wanderer is never weary the world is full of unexpected delights there is the joy of the road the feeling of exhilaration that comes upon a man as he shoulders his knapsack and sets forth bravely into the unknown and there are quiet restingplaces at the journeys end sunrise and sunset the sound of the sea the music of birds darkness and the coming of dawnthese things become invested with a new meaning to the man who has gone out into the wilderness to find his soul he has time too to thinkand to pray and prayer mr graham would have us believe has an added effectiveness when offered amidst the silences of nature    prayers he writes are strong out of doors made in the presence of all the stars one is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there is calm all around and in ones own heart the mysterous beauty of the starry sky reflects itself in the soul and across its mirror sails the pale moon my own body becomes a cradle in which the little christ child sleeps there are angels everywhere i am in universal keeping for the stars are all looking and pointing to me because of the little child the shepherds near by hear heavenly harmony and journeying

free for a few hours at least of the company of saints and heroes this much we owe to mr graham who has added to english literature a book that if we mistake not is destined to endure  a tramps sketches by stephen graham 5s net m5acmillan the reader may consider mr grahams book in two lights either as a volume of remarkably interesting reminiscences of life on the open road or as a powerful appeal to the modern world to forsake the worship of the golden calf the authors tramp was along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and eventually to the heavenly city in the company of russian pilgrims his pen paints delicate little portraits of the simple and loveable russian peasant it describes too with striking vividness nights spent in strange cities and in lonely shacks i slept with the bare world as my house the sky as my roof and god as host he writes and lest an incautious reader should exclaim  how lovely we hasten to add that like the apostle paul mr graham was often in perils of waters in perils in the city and constantly in weariness and painfulness but the author expressly states that his book is more concerned with the tramp than with russia  it is the life of the wanderer and seeker the walking hermit the rebel against modern conditions and commercialism who has gone out into the wilderness commercialism he says is at present the great enemy of the individual man and the only hope for salvation is first of all for a few to live their lives out to the full in order that all others may live their lives completely mr graham seems conscious as he writes that he is a prophet crying in the wilderness and even if some of his readers may consider that he is imagining a vain thing they will be constrained to admit that the pursuit of this ideal has one great merit so far as mr graham is concernedthe delightful record of his vagabondage  a tramps sketches by stephen graham macmillan and co this is another volume by the author of undiscovered russia a charming tour of a tramp a real tramps life along the caucasian and crimean shores mr stephen graham admits frankly that he is a wanderer by predilection a rebel against modern conditions of commercialism which threaten not only to destroy art but the very perception for artistic creation it is a delightful book redolent of the open air of the night of the great silences of expanse and yet full of incident of aperfus into russian conditions and the minds of peasants revealing a real spiritual and material sympathy both with the black earth and the monks of monasteries whose hospitality he enjoyed and with his fellowcomrades of the road it is life that interests the author here we can get it and it is like splashing about in a clear pool on a warm summers day spontaneous in inspiration mature in philosophic contemplation this sort of book gives a man honest pleasure more it sets his heart beating in unison with the author in harmony with the awe and beauty and

this book at a less busy season we may briefly say of it now that it contains some clever characterization and much excellent descriptive writing mr howitts love of though country finds free and genial scope in the subject he has chosen and in many delightful traits of homely virtue and disinterested charity he exhibits country lifo in its most pleasing aspect he is a disciple of wordsworth in his high belief as to the influences of the forms of nature  and in social and religious aspirations still preaches george foxs gospel of peace freedom and simplicity of manners and life though he has put off what he calls 4 the poor crotchets of caps and coats  in which modern quakerdora arrays it mr howitt has earnest opinions and a combative spirit but does not obtrude them in this book in any offensive way indeed dwells throughout with most evident pleasure on the better sido of things we have read the greater part of it with satisfaction and entertainment its defect as a pieco of art is that of spreading its lines and colours over too wide a surface there is a want of that continuous interest which only clearness aud concentration of design can give effectively rut the virtues of mr howitts heroine who is less prominent however than her son the real hero to 6ay nothing of those of his honest and homely farmers and vicars would redeem many more and graver faults  fiction muadam dorrington of the dene the story of a idfe by wvilliani iowitt autho0rof the hall and the hamlet   the year book of the country c in 3 vols london colburn 1851 tieir is no writer of our day who describes english scenery and the rural life of england so truthfully as williami howitt his heart is in his theme he is at home in the field the coppice the wood the countryhouse and the cottage his book of the seasons  and  year book of the country proved him to be a clear observer of nature and combining with the eyes of the naturalist the fancy of the poet he has preserved a series of pictures of rural england which will be remembered and enjoyed when many works of more pretension and perhaps of more power have i passed away and are forgotten a novel the principal scenes of wvhich are laid in the country can scarcely fail to be interesting so many are the opportunities it must i offer for the exercise of his peculiar abilities and accordingly we find in mfadamn dorrington of the dene a succession of charming pictures both of places and persons strung together by a story ingeniously constructed not so much to take the reader by surprise and startle him into attention by incidents that tread upon the very verge of the impossible as is the fashion with most of the modern french novelists and a numerous school at home but which gradually engages the regard of the readers as the characters are revealed in the course of the narrative and as the events unfold themselves by degrees this is precisely as the manner is in real life where we first form an acquaintance of the eye then with the mind then come to feel an attachment for the person and then an interest in his fortunes kvilliam howitt possesses the faculty so all important to the novelist of recommending his characters to our regards by the very thoroughness of the revelations of their weaknesses as well as of their virtues  he knows that only human beings can interest us that human beings have their faults and that a perfect hero or heroine or model man or woman would excite no sympathy in any breast however youthful and romantic therefore he presents to us people as they are the man and woman of common place everyday life so that in their feelings and motives and thoughts we read our own this is the purpose of a fiction all the scenes at the dorringtons and in the village of which they avere the patrons are delightfully told  the english squire and his lady their mansion their grounds the surrounding woods and hills the hamlet and its inhabitants the good vicar and his family the farmer and his workpeople are portrayed to the life individually and grouped and so does this portion of the work recommend itself by its truthfulness that it is always with regret that the reader is taken away from it to places less graphically drawn and personages less real and great is his joy when he is born back again by the telegraphic power which is vested in the writer of a fiction although much tempted we shall not depart in this instance from the wholesome rule we have adopted and anticipate the pleasure of the reader in its perusal by giving him a hint of the plot such a plan of reviewing a novel is indeed equally unjust anl unkind to author and reader one of the chiefest pleasures of a novel is the devnelopment of the plot as we read we are unwilling to lay it down until we have discovered the disentanglement of the doubts and difficulties which are the substance of the story and which it is the business of the novelist ingeniously to create for the very purpose of provoking his ingenuity to overcome them when one has read a review that has given a meagre outline of the plot that zest is gone if then it be read it is only languidly with a foregone conclusion there is no eagerness to adv ance to the end it is laid down at ev ery moment withoutregret and taken up again with careless indifference if at all the province of a literary journal is to introduce new books to its readers as a matter of news and information and as its notice usually precedes the perusal of a novel by the public it is dealing most unfairly and illiberally with the author and the 1ublisher and inconsideratelv towards its reader if it breaks the chain of novelty by a narrative of the plot afterwards indeed when it has been read criticism in the favour of a quarterly or monthly review may properly take it in hand and deal with its plot as it may deserve but it is in our oji on to nistake the design and purpose ofa literarl journal to use it thus and therefore we have alw ays refrained

gardens of armida  i passed through the door she opened and found myself in the piazza which ran along the front between the two towers and all the scene in its beaut lay at once before me the sun was shining and glowing warmly over the whole the pillars of tit piazza were twined round with creepers and puaioi flowers whose blossoms hanging in masses of many rich hues overhead were full of bees how sunny and happy is the sound of bees there mere kati in the piazza where you might enjoy the shade whil contemplating one of the loveliest landscapes ima ginable and on the roof of the piazza there were others where you might take a still ampler range of prospect amidst the cool airs of morning or evening and there stood masses of rich flowers in pots geraniums acacias roses agapanthas heliotropes or other more splendid kinds as the greenhouse and the season yielded them there was a sweetness and beauty about this piazza that was delightful but till more delicious was the scene lying before me it was a glance into ono of those many enchanting paradises that attach to the homes of england the house standing as already mentioned at the head of this valley or glen called the dene the lawn before it descended with considerable steepness the hollo and the sides of the valley clothed with the finest turf and scattered with some of the noblest trees imaginable here rose a broad clark cedar there a gigantic oak its immense stem to which the old closeshorn mossy turf seemed to creep in very lovingness of ancient affection surrounded by a seat here masses of portugal laurel or fragrant bay with various foreign trees as the tuliptree the american sheoak and hickory which had been planted with great taste and now stood in stately grace on the velvet slopes to the right wound away a walk along the higher ground bounded by a tall hedge or rather wall of nicelyclipped laurel and losing itself in  woodland mass to the left a similar walk led along beneath an avenue of noble limetrees and in an easy circuit brought you to the flowergarden at the bottom of the hollow lawn gleamed a large pond margined to the very water with the rich green turf and at its farthest bank soared up two or three lofty and full grown lombardy poplars various waterfowls might be seen swimming or flashing about in playfulness in this pleasant reservoir and birds ra numbers unmolested because they claimed thea share of fruit flitted from tree to tree or sought for insects in the grass of the lawn as i proceeded along the limewalk to the garden i beheld a summerhouse rear its domed roof most attractively out of the wood opposite and my eye followed the valley into which the verdant crofts seemed to fall wi their swelling ridges and dimpled hollows and spreading trees as if emulous for their full share of beauty where all was beautiful beyond them myjj ranged over the ample valley which i had crossed a  coming hither and flitted on over cheerful villagey over the broad uplands farms milla and here aw tdeojernatises of woods with the occasional fwe of a country house on their skirts i thought nxseldom looked on a more pleasant english ijsscape and this place itself seemed so shut in to j ownbeauty and to have such yet unexplored llb and dells as delighted the imagination but l2ill have other occasions to speak of the different rts of this spot i was going on and now holding abruptly to the left i came to where tall masses of nerzreens seemed to bound the lawn and passing ftroueh an opening in them i exclaimed to myself ifhe nest here close at my left hand under the aide of an enormous limetree stood a rustic gardenbouje or shed it was built of rough wood and latched with heather within it was paved with blocks of wood end uppermost and seated round sod in the centre stood a rustic table before it lay little enclosed lawn hemmed in by tall masses of rerereens laurustinus laurels in full flower and orer them dark ilexes and cedars showing themselves in luxuriant growth honeysuckles and jasmines dotted the sides of the nest and borders of flowers nn on each side of it the flowers chiefly in pots the 4ade of the lime evidently injuring the growth of others but out before it a little fountain played in the centre ofthe lawn whence a troop of birds that were washing and frisking in the shallow basin darted away as i appeared and all around were beds of the most glowing flowers perfect masses of the richest colouring tulips ranunculuses roses of different kinds geraniums of superb beauty and annuals of the intensest huesscarlet crimson blue and white gaol in their respective borders and without the slightest mixture producing the most enchanting effect mrs dorringtons passionate love of flowers stood there manifest i could not help lingering a moment there in admiration nor taking up a book which i saw lying on the table ofthe nest and which turned out to be thomas a kempiss  imitation of christ1 proceeding onward in my quest i descended a sloping wilderness of alternate flowers and leaves and evergreens till i found myself at a boundary of oneofthe loftiest hollyhedges i have ever seen and spying a little gate in it found myself next in an old orchard down which i wandered admiring its shadyantiquity till in a little hollow close to the open fields i spied a screen of shrubs that convinced me i had reached the place i sought approaching quietly i stood in an opening into this enclosure but so under the boughs of trees as not to be seen myself and beheld a sight which became to me an indelible picture a beeshed containing at least a dozen hires all of the oldfashioned straw kind stood with its back to the fields and screened from the east rind by a clump of wilding trees over the beeshed clomb masses of honeysuckle and around it pew thyme and lilies wallflowers syringas and other honeyyielding and fragrant flowers beyond suddenly swelled up a green mound on which lay a biggish sturdy country lad who was placed so as to command a view of the hives but seemed more occupied with playing with the ears of a little jetblack silky dog within the screen of shrubs and seated under the arching branches of a remarkably huge berberrytree which had been so cut away beneath jj to form a capacious arbour while overhead it was one golden canopy of flowers in which hummed tome thousands of bees sat mrs

gentlewomen who sat to fanny burney for her characters as this tigress mr howitt may have a fancy for what is extreme and exceptional but so far as his rural dramatis persona go he paints people who have existedthe trials of grace delmey did not end when she became madam dorrington of the dene on diverse grounds her three sons became objects of deep solicitude  and with interest we follow their

return home of vincent dorrington the youth of geniuswhich takes place later in the third volume to set his fortunes to rights and to fulfil his wishes mr howitt has been tempted into a liberal use of the novelists marvels strange to say while no one believes in these it would appear as if every one wished to see them exhibited otherwise those who please to live must have long ago discovered some less hackneyed and more probable mode of winding up their taleswe ought to have said that round about madam dorrington dene country neighbours are sown as rich in peculiarity as those who diversified the existence of fredrika bremers heroine in short this is the best novel which mr howitt has as yet given to the publiccommendable for its vigour and freshness and for the pleasure which its writer

the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby os max goschen an unmistakable originality is evident in every one of the fourteen stories and sketches which comprise the adventuress the author seems to have studied maupassant but followed him at a safe distance for if the method is similar the manner is his own mr willoughby loves his london and places in it the familiar types generally with a suggestion of the bizarre but without straining for effect and always with delicacy he has the true dramatic instinct even the longest speeches of his characters have a cumulatively stimulating effect  the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby goschen 2s net of these fourteen  stories three are distinctly striking by reason of a certain passionate crudity a realism that gives actual discomfort when we think that it may mean reality these three are  lily may  life wins and  a sea captain  quick cruel sensational sketches that evolve thoughts of pastel work  dark clouded backgrounds now lit up by the lurid gleams of the lowest life now suffused with a changing glow of luxury we would add the  watch night service did it not recall overforcibly mr wellss  love and mr lewisham  a london dawn  and the  psychology of fires  are more in the nature of tours de force  vivid in their way but unreal showing too much composition in the pastel this defect is still more marked in the descriptions of the isle of dogs and rosherville and it reaches a climax in the 4 correspondence mr willoughby are we right in the sex  delights in his technique which is nearly if not always equalled by his observation  but it is our impression that both will run to seed if devoted overmuch to sketches of this nature  in a larger theme these qualities would be kept within bounds and so be more effective he might try a wider and more complex field  the adventuress for example though its abrupt ending evidently so designed is not devoid of cleverness might be developed into a good novel,novel_contra

exclusion from society and deep shame for the cause but she is now to be punished through others her children have to learn their mothers guilt and to endure its consequences nothing can be more beautifully drawn than the character of alice the gentle and affectionate disposition the sensitive and romantic temperament are supported by strict and high principlethat passive energy which generous feeling properly directed inspires in woman no person who did not deeply feel what her sex can and ought to be could have embodied so delicate and yet so noble a conception as the character of alice howard the story deepens towards the closethe erring wife has to see her children perish before her eyes oppressed even unto death by her shame her husbands naturally selfish and violent

the jeir and other stories by ivan tur genev translated from the russian by constance garnett heinemannin the fifteenth volume of her excellent translation of tourguenief mrs garnett presents five pieces which belong to very different periods of the authors literary career the jew is an early sketch and seems to us to show a certain crudity on the other hand the next piece an unhappy girlwas written when the great novelist was fifty and is an extraordinarily powerful tale it shows his genius in full vigour it has been already translated into english by a r thompson trubner  co 1888 the selfish old man ivan matveitch is one of the types familiar to us in tourguenief who loves to draw the heartless grandees of the period of catherine  the duellist again is an early work of 1846 and like some of though first sketches of tourguenief in many places is imitative thus the passion of kister for the rather unsentimental masha reminds us of lenski and olga in the  eugene onieguin  of pushkin in the sameway we see him as previously mentioned in our columns imitating gogol the three portraits is an astonishingly powerful story although it belongs to the early period of theauthors creative power never were the features of the russian society of old timesportrayed with such realistic force the last sketch  enough  a fragment from the notebook of a dead artist is a sort of confession of faith of tourguenief and shows profound pessimism the critic can only say as he reads it the thread of life untwisted 1 into its first consistencies the tales are full of those splendid epigrams and profound observations on life for which the author is notable the frenchman who in the course of twenty years had not succeeded in pronouncing his patrons name correctly is a true picture something of the sort prevailed in the treatment of russian names among ourselves in earlier times mrs bradford the lady who edited in 1840 the memoirs of princessdashkov calls her dashkaw throughout although she lived with her for some years this form of the name is impossible under any mode of transliteration we must adhere to what we have said on former occasions a few notes would have been useful for the general reader as to prince viazemsky griboiedov and araktcheev perhaps the russian expression  st nicholas on hens legs  p 149 as the name of a church would not seem so absurd if we remember the proverbial use of the phrase ie on a weak inadequate foundation or as it is expressed in the saying which comes from the russian popular stories a cottage on hens legs supported by a pie and roofed with a cake  izbushka na kuryikh nozhkakh pirogom pod perta blinom pokrita  it is probable that mr garnett who writes the prefaces to these volumes is mistaken in supposing that the novel is depreciated among us as a form of literature the dedication to stepniak revives the memory of that strange dreamy ineffectual man over whom the terrible circumstances in which he left his country cast such a melancholy shade,novel_contra
  the seiners by james b connollv hodder  staughton shiner is it may be explained the name applied both to the vessels and the men that go afishing for mackerel off the northwest coast of america and canada during the summer months when seine nets are used and schools containing as many as a thousand barrels of fish are captured in one haul for the supply of the markets in new york and boston in treating of the seiners and their hardy lives the author touches a phase that scarcely belongs to the immediate present seiners remain still but steam as applied to commercial navigation is steadily changing the conditions of life among the strenuous fishermen of gloucester and similar ports it is a stirring life that mr connolly describes a life full of excitement of feverishly hard toil and furiously enjoyed spells ashore the dissipation is touched on but lightly here and the brave stress of labour of effort and heroic daring which form part of every cruise is dealt with fully and with telling effect as a tale the book lacks coherence  its construction is loose its episodes are not well knit or closely strung but as a series of pictures of the life of these hardy fishermen of their recklessly daring seamanship and indomitable energy the work is excellent the author feels what he writesso much is evidentand more than once or twice he makes the reader feel it too and that is where his literary ability comes in his style is highly colloquial but none the less he indulges in a good many purple patches,novel_contra

receiving due guerdon for the one tale in three volumes which established his name now does light summer service by presenting to his readers one volume with three tales the name of the work is printed above the title however is applicable to the first story only the other tales having headings of their own we of course shall not spoil the readers interest in the narrative by unfolding the plot we will confine ourselves to remarking that as in mr reades last work he selected a couple of social subjects for the foundation of a matteroffact romance wherein he illustrated the maxim that it is never too late to mend so now has he chosen a social subject erne that may be said to have been popular in the sense of its being commonly discussed rather than of having found general favour and therein he professes to show in a certainly novel way that  the course of true love never did run smooth the author winds up his story by criticising it lads and lasses he says this trifle is what i have called it a jen desprit written for your amusement and not intended to improve you instruct you or elevate your morals mr read means that he is here only the pleasant storyteller and not like

the folklore of rome collecte by waord of i mouth fro the people by r h busi author of  patralias   sagas from the far east c london longmans  co 1874 miss blsk deserves great credit for the perseverance with which she has collected her extensive store of roman folktales and for the pains she has taken in grouping and marshalling them in almost every respect her present book is far superior to the other volumes of a similar nature which she has compiled and we may fairly look forward to receiving from her if she unflaggingly continues her studies such work as may be praised without reservation at present although her method bas decidedly improved there is still room in it for further improvement for instance a collector who takes down tales from the mouths of the common people ought if professing to work in the cause of science to give the names and address of every storyteller otherwise the world has no guarantee fbr the authenticity of the transcript this duty miss busk has entirely ignored and consequently we have no means of testing the accuracy of her impressions this is the more to be lamented inasmuch as these roman folktales are often told in language unlike that in which their sister stories are narrated elsewhere we may take as an example the passage in filagranata p 9 which depicts one of those wellknown scenes in which a prince having kissed a relative in spite of his wifes warning not to do so forgets that wife and prepares to take to himself another we have seen the kissing incident described a hundred times but never in such a style as this then all in the palace went to their sleepingchambers but the prince as it had been his wont from his childhood upwards went into his mothers room to kiss her after she wats asleep and when he saw her placid brow on the pillow with the soft white hair parted on either side of it and the eyes which were wont to gaze or him with so much love resting in sleep he could not forbear from pressinf his lips on her forehead and giving the wonted kiss as miss busk holds forth a promise of a second series let us hope that she will follow the good example set by mr campbell in his tales of the west highlands in which the name and address of the narrator of each story are conscientiously recorded as well as the date and place of its narration in that second series we would suggest also that as a general rule not more than one version of the same story shculd be given at length the repetition of all but identical incidents soon becomes wearisome on the other hand variants such as those which miss busk has given in small print are always valuable to comparers though they are apt to prove tedious to ordinary readers miss busk does not appear to be well acquainted with what has already been done in italy or is nfow being done to illustrate the folklore of its various provinces it seems that she  had heard it so often positively asserted that modern italy had no popular mythology and no contribution of special versions to offer to the worlds store of traditionary tales that she long refrained from attempting to discover any current italian folktales at last she took to hunting through the bookshops new and old to find any sort of collection of traditionary tales ready made but only with the effect of establishing the fact that no italian grimm had yet arisen to collect and organise them and put them into available shape it is true that she has heard of professor de gubernatis but she did not see his book on zooloyical iytlhology academt vol iv p 221 till after her ms was in the printers hands moreover she tells us the comparatively recent collection of sicilian tales by laura gonzenbach it was published in 1870 we may as well observe mentioned by irot ssor de 4ubernatis i did not know of and have not been able to see now to send information from london to a student of italian folklore residing in the capital of italy might seem to be equivalent to sending owls to athens or coals to newcastle it may be of use however to other explorers of the field to which miss busk has devoted herself if we give a few references to some of the books which have already

by angelo de gubernatis in 1869 and the novelloja fiare a tin a and the norellaja milanese both edited by vittorio imbriani the former at naples in 1871 and the latter at bologna in 1872 in all parts of italy indeed at the present moment the tales current among the peasantry are being diligently collected and sedulously compared before long the italian folktale will be better represented than almost any other member of the widelyspread family to which it belongs it is of course unnecessary to say that there is very little that is absolutely novel in the rounan folktales the fiarole which occupy the first third of miss busks colleoc tion are variants of the old familiar  fairytales  to which we have so often listenedtales which if we are not mistaken have passed from the pens of professional eastern storytellers to the lips of the roman peasantry some of the details are curious thus in  the dark king a variant of the cupid and psyche story or that of  beauty and the beast combined with  blue beard the girl who opens the door of the forbidden chamber finds within it  a num ber of beautiful maidens weaving glittering raiment and  a goldsmith and all his men  making ornaments all of whom state that they are preparing the wedding apparel of the dark kings bride but beyond them is 4a little old hunchback sitting crosslegged and patching an old torn coat with a heap of other wornout clothes lying about him and he says he is mending the rags for the girl to go away in who was to have been the bride of the dark king and soon afterwards she has to retire in rags and disgrace after having driven a knife into the breast of her sleeping and unsuspecting lord in a variant of the story the deccan punchkin the russian koshchei the norse  giant who had no heart in his body the external object with which the demoniacal personages life is mysteriously connected is a stonewhich is lodged inside the head of a bird which lives inside the head of a leveret which resides inside the central head of a sevenheaded hydra when this stone is placed under the pillow of the demoniacal being who is represented as a wizard or magician he gives three terrible yells turning himself round and round three times and falls dead the incident has been interpolated in a version evidently derived from a literary source of the story of  aladdins lamp in a roman version apparently borrowed from modern greece of the strange myth of the king who insists upon marrying his daughter because her foot is exactly fitted by her dead mothers shoe the princess escapes from her father inside  a figure of an old woman just like life fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it just like a real woman in  the two hunchbacked brothers  we have an unsatisfactory version of a fairy story well known in coltic lands a hunchback is surrounded on a wide moor by a whole host of little hunchbacks who dance around him chanting plaintivelysaldbbto domouica many times at last he chimes in with the word  lunedi   whereupon both he and i they lose their humps his equally hunchbacked brother having tried the same ecepriment and having added the line  martei   to the song of  a tribe of hunchbacks which ransabbato domoenica lunedi   receives from them a drubbing and an added hump the story is unintelligible and unreasonable in its roman dress in the form in which it appears in the siddui kmir it is perfectly intelligible and certain premises being granted completely reasonable more   over the celtic tale is fraught with but a small amount of moral teaching while the italian tale can boast of none at all but their mongolian elder sister is absolutely replete with edifying doctrine after the favole in miss busks collection follow a number of  legendary tales ghost and treasure stories ciarpe c the ghost stories are disappointing and the jooular tales have unavoidably suf fered greatly in transit still there is much that is

thc ad endures of dr brady by w h russell lld 3 vols tinsley brothers a novel by the author of  letters from the crimea is sure to command attention were it only from a feeling of curiosity to see how the vigorous depictor of exciting and romantic scenes from real life would succeed when he applied himself to fiction as might be expected dr russell has written a powerful and interesting work although many of the incidents certainly border on the sensational the characters however arc lifelike and attractive and what is far more in these days original and this alone would distinguish it from the ordinary novel of the day dr brady is an irishman who passes a very eventful life as an army doctor and in that capacity is present during the whole of the crimean campaign and is also an actor in the indian mutiny as an irishman and connected with irishmen the hero gives the author an opportunity to introduce into his work sketches ot his fellow countrymen  and accordingly we find here several that for fire and truth bear comparison with levels best the doctor plays of course another important part in the book that of a lover and the lovemaking is mingled with the war scenes so as to prevent the latter becoming too like history the only objection we have to the heroine is her want of spirit and even dr brady himself it seems to us might show a little more pluck in the matter of his lovemaking it is not particularly praiseworthy for a young lady to promise to marry a man she tloes not love merely because her uncle wishes her especially when a more favoured being exists who returns her love mary brady the heroine is made to act in this unromantic way and by so doing naturally diminishes the interest a reader likes to feel in so important a personage the thought will arise that a girl who can come to the altar and swear to love a man she knows she has no such feeling for can have little respect for herself and will utterly fail in understanding the sacred nature of the marriage ceremony dr brady too the man she loves beholds his adored one on the verge of marrying another for no good reason yet makes no effort to prevent the sacrifice this conduct on his part certainly verges on thc imbecile in other respects the heros character is by no means feeble the chief faults to be found w ith the book arise from an overcrowding of the exciting incidents which come too quickly one after the other and give too sensational a tone to the writing the mystery connected with the heros mother is rather overdone and the explanation connected with some of her movements and acts is obscure and unsatisfactory we should have preferred too that the author had not given us quite so much about the crimean war and the indian mutiny for his previous works contain all the information given here and more too it is as if dickens were to write another novel and reproduce in it parts of  pickwick again there are several portions of the buok that are utterly disconnected from the tale and have little or nothing to do with the plot these would do very well by themselves as separate sketches but it is inartistic to pad a good story with them for instance there ire many pages filled with an account of a revenue cutter chasing a mysterious schooner from ireland to america and this chase after occupying the readers attention for avery long period of time ends in nothing we are never told more about this mysterious boat except that its captain is met by the hero some time after but even this meeting throws no light on the matter and has no reference to the real tale however these faults are insignificant in comparison with the good qualities of the novel and even the blemishes we have pointed out arise from a want of care in preparing the materials for the story and do not indicate any weakness in the way in which those materials are worked up,novel_contra

fiction i lost endeavour by john masefield thomas nelson and sons 2s net mr masefield is one of the few writers of the present day whom one may term on its higher plane an artist on its lower plane a selfrespecting craftsman it is possible to disagree profoundly at times with the work he turns out even as it is possible to complain not only of his conception of his art but of the manner of its achievement but it is quite impossible to neglect or disparage him that is to say if his work does not come to us carrying the reason of its being its mien and manner at least declare it to have had some urgent cause of being in the mind of its author that is muchin truth it is all and in a day largely given up to the mere making of books it is the mark of an author that demands reading where so much may be safely neglected therefore this present book of his will we fear not much enhance his reputation it bears all the signs of having been scotched in the making to serve the purpoc e of the series for which it was intended not that mr masefield can deny himself or the spirit that impels him his mood will out but it displays itself in one or two ill i ways either the worthier element of the book is hushed to a subservient portion a far echo of itself or it usurps the action all the tales of the earth are built on the same lines it is the manner of their handling that marks the difference between worthiness and unworthiness in the present instance mr alasefield has sketched his tale to fit the scope of his volume and we often feel that it is demanding of him a larger treatment he himself feels it and therefore now and then indulges himself with things that do not belong to his story it is frankly a tale of adventure charles harding is at school near deptford towards the latter end of the seventeenth century being sent one day by dr carter who keeps this academy for the sons of gentlemen into deptford to procure his weekly portion of snuff harding with teodoro mora the foreign master at the academy is waylaid and captured for export as a slave he is sold to a tobaccofarmer in virginia where teodoro mora or little theo  as he was anciently nicknamed at the deptford academy is transported further south it is to  little theo  that the main adventure comes for his master soon dies and escaping thence strange wanderings befall himstrange not only in themselves but in the province in which he finds taut craft and obedient crews till he can readily be forgiven the thought that a fatherly destiny had him in charge for the accomplishment of great ends let us not spoil mr masefields story by telling it over in detail suffice it to say that mora became initiated into the ancient mysteries and ritual of the indians of the south he is hailed by them as the saviour of old prophecy who is to bind them into a nation and cast out the white men who have invaded their lands 2o high a mission with all that it means of power and glory naturally inflames his imagination for he knows it possible of realisation to this end he is tutored and disciplined by their priests and for a final consummation is taken by them to their holy island where a special caste of priests resides in attendance on their central temple their hierapolis of worship none other may land but he for the very earth is sacred they leave him at the shore having arrived he has difficulty in finding the temple for the vegetation is rank and the forest inextricable when at last he finds it however death and desolation greet him on all hands a plague has swept over the island and all the priests are dead moreover he is many miles from the shore and thus he seems likely to learn the lot of a castaway indeed this might very likely have been so but for the visit of a crew of pirates that discover him feverstricken on the shore he is taken by them and being competent to navigate is made sailing master and led on a smuggling expedition to far virginia his plans and papers lie guards zealously from his quondam comrades and lie will not let them extract from him what took him to the island meanwhile charles harding has been serving his time as a slave being sent on one occasion on a distant errand for his master what strange thing should befall him but that he should be captured by a band of smugglers and that this band of smugglers should have as its chief no less a person than little theo no sooner does this happen than two iiomentous events occur first little theo learns that his captain has ransacked his papers aid has fled to discover what of worth the island held for him second their band is attacked by indians thereafter it becomes a chase for the island the tale is well told and yet the excellence of the form has its drawbacks charles harding is in conduct of the first portion telling all within his knowledge till his meeting with little theo and the 4oght with the indians little theo takes up the relation saying what makes the captains theft of his plans so important and what urgent cause drives him to pursuit then charles harding continues the tale telling of the pursuit to the conclusion thus the sequence of narration is deftly secured but the conclusion after so urgent a flagellation of the fancy after so many difficulties encountered and furiously over come it is a little disconcerting to discover the temple on the island blown up by the errant captain and his comrades dire iconoclasts  and to see our heroes turn to the very mundane business of ironore merchants yet so it is the endeavour is indeed lost but more is lost than the endeavour a good book has been lost it has turned to barrenness in mr masefields hands for it is not a short story tritely and fitly told it is a tale of portentous scope crippled in the making but there are passages that bear witness to the hand that achieved them such is charles hardings account of the fight with the red indians a veritable masterpiece of strange and potent excitement such too is  little theos  beautiful account of the island and his discoveries there but such passages are only proof that the hand that penned the book is worthier of better things than it

lord eilgobbin lord kilgobbin a tale of ireland in our own timi by charles lever lld in three volumes smith elder and co in the touching dedication of this work  to the memory of one whose companionship made the happiness of a long life mr lever states that it was  written in breaking health and broken spirits and expresses a hope that the effort may be his last while refraining from intermeddling with his sorrow we may venture without impertinence to give utterance to a wish that  lord eilgobbin  may not conclude the career of the ablest of our irish novelists the large circle of readers who have for so many years derived pleasure and instruction from the perusal of mr levers works will probably be increased by the novel before us which is in many respects an improvement on all its predecessors there is certainly no sign here of failing powers but on the contrary unmistakable proofs of advanced maturity of thought and sentiment no one can read this novel with out perceiving that although its author is not a very profound he is a shrewd intelligent and practised observer of men who has had the benefit of an unusually extensive and varied experience and that he has attained in no mean degree to that philosophic mind  which age does not always bring in its train  lord eilgobbin in short is a book that will be relished by grown men as well as by lads for while it is quite as diverting as  harry olorrequer or charles omalley it at the same time has a higher aim and purpose than the amusement of the reader the plan for we can hardly call it the plot of this novel ts cleverly constructed and skilfully worked out our interest in the fortunes of the principal personages who figure in it is never permitted to flag indeed at the close of the book we feel a strong desire to know more of their fate than has been revealed to us and although the characters are only sketched in outline they are boldly and vigorously drawn probably they are all more or less studies or at least compositions from the life but only the subordinate characters give us the impression of accurate and truthful portraits the distinguishing traits of the heroes and heroines are cleverly delineated but even these traits acquire undue prominence from the incompleteness of the portraitures neither the story nor the characters of lord kilgobbin however constitute its chief point of interest this is above all an irish political novel and it is to the sketch of contemporary irish policy it contains that we would specially direct attention the difficulties surrounding a task of this kind are many and obvious and mr lever has in our opinion displayed not only great tact and skill but also rare good taste in his mode of dealing with them there is a commendable absence of party feeling in the book and no attack is made on individual politicians the authors and instruments of the policy depicted are typical rather than actual characters it would not be easy to find the exact or even approximate prototypes of lord danesbury the lord lieutenant of his private secretary mr walpole of mr atlee the universally accomplished and thoroughly unscrupulous young journalist who contributes articles to all the principal magazines and journals in europe on all sides or of mr daniel donogan the fenian head centre who is a figure of heroic and ideal mould and yet these personages are invested with a high degree of verisimilitude and undeniably bear a certain amount of resemblance to men who have influenced the fortunes of ireland in our own time mr lever has approached his subject in the spirit of an artist and not of a politician he lays before us a concrete picture of the irish problem and of the means that have recently been employed to solve it but he does not in this book propose any solution of his own although 4 lord kilgobbin  has a purpose it cannot be said to have a party purpose it is instructive without being didactic while admirably calculated to increase the readers knowledge of ireland and the irish question it does not seek directly to influence his political opinions the author is evidently no admirer of the whig policy he portrays but in the present work he strives with no mean degree of success to maintain an impartial attitude in all probability no friend of though whigs could have given us so truthful a delineation of their method of governing ireland as mr lever has set before us mr cecil walpole private secretary to his relative the lordlieutenant is the chief exponent and embodiment of whig principles in the work and he is in his way an original and effective creation this elegant young gentleman is described as  an aristocrat by birth and predilection who made a parade of democratic opinions a pale finelyfeatured almost effeminate young man the most recent product of the age we live in who  affected a sort of crichtonism in the variety of his gifts and as linguist musician artist poet and philosopher loved to display the scores of things he might be instead of the mild very ordinary young gentleman he was when we are introduced to mr walpole he is on a ramble to the westmeath lakes in company with mr lockwood of the carbineers an extra aidedecamp to the viceroy  not very positive whether their object was to angle for trout or to fish for that  knowledge of ireland so popularly sought after in our day walpole is certainly a promising whig and there is truth as well as humour in mr levers description of a promising young whig as 44 one who coquettes with radical notions but fastidiously avoids contact with the mob and who fervently believing that all popular concessions are spurious if not stamped with whig approval would like to treat the democratic leaders as forgers and knaves owing to the distaste of lord danesbury for the post assigned to him by the government the viceroy absents himself from ireland and leaves the government of that country to a large extent in the hands of mr walpole who has been in the habit rf assuring his distinguished relative that there is a mt game to be played in ireland and he throws himsdf into the game heartily and confidently for he hiteadt to play in accordance with a  plan  that is he thimb bound to win his little scheme is disclosed in a  stricuv confidential conversation with lord kilgobbins simwha has been persuaded by the fenian donogan to offer himself as a candidate for his native county in the  nationalist interest and who has called on the private secretary to ask the support of the government instead of complying with or refusing the request of the aspirant the  craft mr walpole seeks to astonish his visitor by an exposition of the masterly tactics by which he proposes to deal with irish disaffection  well now here it is the irish vote as the yankees would cali it is of undoubted value to us hut it is confoundedly dear with paul cullen on one side and fenianism on the other we have no peace time was when you all pulled one way and a sop to the pope pleased you all now that will suffice no longer the  sovereign pontiff dodge  is the surest of all ways to offend the nationals so that in reality what we want in the house is a number of liberal irishmen who will trust the government to do as much for the catholic church as english bigotry will permit and as much for the irish peasant as will not endanger the rights of property over the channel  there is a wide field there certainly said dick smiling is there not cried the other exultingly not only does it bowl out the established church and protestant ascendancy but it inverts the position of landlord and tenaat to unsettle everything in ireland so that anybody might hope to be anything or to own heaven knows whatto legalise gambling for existence to a people who delight in high play and yet not involve us in a civil warwas a grand policy kearney a very grand policy not that i expect a young ardent spirit like yourself fresh from college ambitions and highflown hopes will take this view dick only smiled and shook his head just so resumed walpole  i could not expect you to like this programme and i know already all that you allege against it but as b says kearney the man who rules ireland must know how to take command of a ship in a state of mutiny and yet never suppress the revolt the brutal old tories used to master the crew and hang the ringleaders and for that matter they might have hanged the whole ships company we know better kearney and we have so confused and addled them by oar policy that if a fellow were to strike his captain he would never be quite sure whether he was to be strung up at the gangway or made a petty officer do you see it now  unfortunately the working out of the details of this policy required more caution and discretion than mr walpole could command and the discovery of a memorandum advising a chief constable to assist and bribe donogan to leave ireland induced lord danesbury to resign the lordlieutenancy and reduced his accomplished secretary to the necessity of accepting an appointment worth about 20001 ayear in guatemala in his love affairs this  promising young whig is as fickle and as unsuccessful as in his public career and the manner in which mr lever sustains the consistency of this character in all his various relations and proceedings is a veritable triumph of artistic fiction there is a great deal of almost equally interesting matter in this novel that deserves mention but we must content ourselves with stating that  lord kilgobbin is in our opinion the best work of fiction that its author has written  lord kilgobbin by c1iait is leave 3 vopa smith elder  co the publication in a complete form of mr levers last novel which a melancholy and pathetic dedication points to as his last in another and less welcome sense is the principal fact of the month in the department of fiction it is not common in a good novelist though only too usual in a bad one to find his last book exactly as readable as his first yet lord kilgobbin is at least as amusing and brilliant if not so dashing as those wellknown stories which

sir george tressady by mrs humphry ward 6s smith and elder some of us critics of mrs humphry ward have the air of being impossible to please we scouted  robert elsmere  and marcella  for being sugarcoated pamphlets and when she struck out on a quite new path in bessie cotterell in which there was no pamphlet we said that she was attempting work that did not become her now she returns to the earlier model her new story being in fact a sequel to is marcella well at least we cannot ask her to go back to the bessie cotterell  type for that in her hands failed for want of artistic sincerity and her reversion to the kind of thing that first brought her fame means that she has tendencies likings aptitudes that she cannot be criticised out of we ought to be more reasonable now and we are but perhaps the merits of sir george tressady  have something to do with it it is the story of a rather likeable rather colourless man of brains and nar row sympathies who spoilt his political career because marcella exerted such an influence over him that he voted against his party and even his convictions marcella was a goddess to him and he had married a little thin natured shallow vixen of a wife he behaves with great propriety so does marcella so does marcellas husband they all do except lady tressady but propriety does not keep off tragedy and what with his amusingly reckless and frivolous old mother his embittered wife his poverty the strikes among his workmen his shattered parliamentary career and his hopeless adoration of marcella when a hard and heroic death comes to him it is welcome the parliamentary incidents do not strike us as probable marcella in her mellower years is more distasteful than ever wvith her fawning amiability her air of making eyes at all the world including her husband her child and the eastend seamstresses she is a most unpleasing personalitywith something of the chadband in her for all her indiscretions but the book though a dull book is the work of a woman of intellect and of unusually strong sympathies the portraits here are subtler and more living than in her earlier works especially the disagreeable ones like the two lady tressadys and the scenes in the eastend are stamped with sincerity if there was but a little spark of fire anywhere  here is not the temper nor the material out of which great novels can come but in fiction at least we have no abler presentment of the selfconscious earnestness of the time  sir george tressady mrs wards new novel by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co there can be no question that mrs ward is a puzzle to the conscientious critic this has partly resulted from the history of her career as a novelist if we leave miss bretherton out of the reckoning we may say that she seemed to bo sprung upon the reading world with an exaggerated form of that sort of success which somebody has called a sue ces gladstonea rather dangerous preeminence in which if she has a rival it is as his advertisements remind us mr hall caine schoolgirls at once spoke of her with awe and many persons of influence people interested in religious and philanthropic developments whose literary judgement was not necessarily above the level of the schoolgirls on the other hand a section of the illuminati chiefly because she dealt with these religious and social matters legitimate subjects if any were for dramatic treatmentat once set her down for a prig and a pedant and would have no more to do with her all this tends to the confusion of the moderate and modest critic has he to do with a sort of cleansed and refined zola he asks himself or only a more philosophical edna lyall it must make the application of the heavendescended maxim not easy to the distinguished author herself in the present case the critic might well get rid of his difficulties by indiscriminate praise of mrs wards  sir george tressady were such a course fair to any one concerned there is so much that is good throughout and the latter part especially is so fine and moving that faultfinding is disarmed most of the qualities which distinguished  marcella  far above the run of its contemporaries are present again here we have nothing so fully understood and so finely handled as the village life in the previous volumenothing so poetical as the description of hurds poaching or so affecting as the night of hurds execution spent by marcella in the cottage with his wife but the glimpses we get here of the labouring classes their ways and thoughts whether in eastend london or in the mining village in the midlands we should have supposed either north staffordshire or derbyshire from the peoples talk had not mrs ward while giving the characteristic e for a piece  or pleace for placeomitted altogether the equally characteristic ii for e a  for he are well realized and now and then are startlingly effective the english is always choice and in one passage at least the description of sir george tressady awaking in his library after a great quarrel with his wife it reaches a high level the morning air blew upon him and he drew it in with delight how blessed was the sun and the silence of the streets and the dappled sky there to the east beyond the square  after those long hours of mental tension in the crowd and heat of the house of commons what joy what physical relief he caught eagerly at the sensation of bodily pleasure driving away his cares letting the morning freshness recall to him a hundred memoriesthe memories of a traveller who has seen much and loved nature more than man blue surfaces of rippling sea cool steeps among the mountains streams brawling over their stones a thousand combinations of grass and trees and sunand like heralds before the presence these various images flitted passed drew to one side while memory in trembling revealed at last the best she hadan english river flowing through june meadows under a heaven of flame a woman with a child the scents of grass and hawthorn the plashing of water the story of the novel is that of a young man returned after some years of travel and study in our indian and colonial empire full of the revived imperialist if everybody had his due they might fairly be described as the kiplingesque ideas which are such a marked feature in contemporary politics mrs ward is always well up to date in her appreciation of  movements young sir george tressady enters parliament in this spirit and attaches himself to a fourth party led by a certain lord fontenoy whose prototype is not far to seek though it must be said that he only slightly resembles this deceased statesmanwhich is bitterly opposed to the conservative government of the day a rather socialistic body among whom the leading figure is our former friend aldous raeburn now lord maxwell of course therefore mar i celia comes upon the scene in fact she 1 occupies it and is almost as much the heroine of this book as she was of the one  which bears her name at first tressady  is strongly opposed to marcellas way of looking at things and prejudiced against her personally almost at the beginning of the book he marries a certain letty  sewell representative of all that is narrow i minded and vulgar in a privileged class j little as george and his wife have in i common in their natures their views are at 1 the outset the same so far as letty can be said to have any views now comes the change an accidental meeting at a country house leads to a growing friendship between tressady and marcella on her side it never gets beyond the pity of seeing a naturally fine intellect and character cramped and pledged to the wrong cause with him it grows into a passion of devotion of which his wife has good cause to be jealous in this way we have a double motive running through the story  mrs ward almost always has two parallel threadsthe motive of tressadys conversion or halfconversion from the old tory doctrine  power to the capable and strong to a fuller recognition of the hardships and the claims of manual labour and therewith that of his personal conversion to swell the ranks of marcellas devotees it ends in tressadys throwing over his party at a critical division and retiring from politics it also ends in his confessing in a moment of abandonment his romantic love to marcella and as at the same moment letty has gone the length of writing to lord maxwell this modern madame roland is suddenly brought face to face with the fact that she has unwittingly carried disaster into another mans married life very beautifully she humbles herself before the vulgarminded letty tressady and in a great degree repairs the mischief that has been done but sir george is spared the  cursed spite  of being obliged to struggle for ever with the disjointedness of his world he takes part in a rescue down one of his mines and is killed by the falling in of the roof much of all this history is finely conceived and very moving it makes for edification as mrs wards novels always do a great deal of the machinery of the talethe side characters the scenes and dialogues  is admirably contrived and obviously at the expense of great pains and it is an unpleasant task to have to point to the serious drawbacks in the book as a whole what in reality makes mrs ward such a puzzle is that her work is so strangely made up of good and bad the greatest failure in the present case is in the character of marcella marcella boyce seemed a fenuine creation marcella maxwell has egenerated into a schoolgirls heroine a bundle of perfections neither more nor less she is precisely the personage who ought to have been as she was wanting only two steps in the peerage given in marriage to a firstclass earl who kept his carriage of course one will be called a cynic for this assertion but if there be any flaw except of the litterofroseleavesanddinofnightingales order which prevents marcella maxwell being put down as a perfect beauty a perfect wife a perfect mother a perfect philanthropist ana a perfect great lady we do not know where it is to be discovered this is more than a grave it is in a certain sense a fatal error in spite of ben jonson it is precisely the growing like a tree growing invisibly in the thoughts of an author or visibly in his or her writings that makes a character of fiction better or worsethat distinguishes in fact between the created and the manufactured personage of a tale and allows you as no other test does to draw the line between the bestemployed talent and genius think of balzacs people or of thackerays of the grandeur et decadence either of cesar birotteau or of colonel newcome think of ethel or clive of dobbin or hawdon crawley of beatrix esmond baroness bernsteiu this reappearance of marcella therefore is terribly enlightening we frankly confess that the old marcella seemed to us when first we made her acquaintance a complete creation a vital being now looking back and asking ourselves of what she has been stripped to turn her into the superhuman and therefore nonhuman lady maxwell we do not find very much  plenty of opinions but of character not an abundance it is rather we take it as a result than as a cause of this lack of the winged gift of the true creator that mrs ward is able to introduce so much we will not say of teaching but of illustration into her books if her people were more alive they would take the bit between their teeth and refuse to do the things they were wanted to do to illustrate some phase of national tendency or some preconceived theory of the way character developes one might in addition cite a hundred small but speaking instances to prove that our author never forgets her audienceas for example where in the scene of sir georges death she takes care to mention that his message was delivered to letty that passage alone would show that she had not lost herself in her art indeed this whole final scene moving though it is has the air of something written up as if the author had encountered elsewhere a scene conceived on the same lines and said to herself  i can do that too  sir george flvssady by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co in sir george tressady mrs humphry ward has seen fit to test the sincerity of our admiration for the central character of one of her former works by introducing marcella as the dca ex mach ina of her present novel charming though she was on though occasion of our first acquaintance a doubt is born as to whether her reappearance has added anything to our store of pleasant memoriesthe question of sequel in fiction being one not often attended by success several factors combining to render the result as a ride experimental one important reason doubtless is the proverbial fickleness of readers themselves while another may possibly lie in the writers own attitude towards even the most wellconceived and carefully developed personage of the imagination in though interval of presentation a marked change may have taken place in his own interest therein all that was freshest and best having furnished the impulse to the first effort marcella called to do duty again does in a measure redeem our expectation even at times exciting some of the old witchery yet the spark which woke her to life in the story of her youth seems lacking in this record of marcella married and marcella turned politician we view her now from an outside standpoint which admits of coldest criticism she is no longer a wayward noble stumbling lovable girl but is summarised heartlessly and with some emphasis as a political intriguante implying the unscrupulous coquette she may be as earnest as intense as beautiful as loving towards poor humanity as faithfully devoted to her husbands interests as ardent a parliamentarian as the old marcella would have been when developed by her new surroundings but the germ is wanting and only a wellarticulated marionette animated by overmuch pulling remains that sir george tressadys parliamentary upsetting to say nothing of his domestic undoing should indirectly hinge upon this character in whom we have least belief would indicate a fallingoff in the authors further development of marcella it were ungracious to dwell further upon this point when a debt of gratitude remains yet unacknowledged mrs ward having introduced many new and several wellobserved characters in whom thc first interest of the general leader will centre letty especially sir georges wife is brilliantly portrayed showing both skill and delicate insight in though handling whatever her phases and there are many she carnes conviction which is though best perhaps that can be said of any of those who speak and move in the pages of fiction her small ambitions and petty triumphs her little prettinesses the utter inability of her poor soul to rise above the height of her husbands shoestrings her lack of sympathy with all outside the most limited of social belongingsall appear in such light as to prove her reality she embodies the dainty pretty heartless society creature whom everyone knows so well and who is so often illpaired with a sir george of ones acquaintance letty is certainly alive more the pity for wherever she is one may be sure she is bruising the heart of some earnest man sir george himself is interesting wc like him so well that we wish ho had never befooled himself even for the brief moment of his infatuation with marcella every scene with his wifeand those with bin vain prodigal deceitful dying motherbear the stamp of truth thora are no false lines here no rubbing out no substitution no blur all is direct sufficient needful from beginning to end mis ward hits shown her knowledge of the man and grasp of his position the downfall of his ambitions his hampered domestic life with it  fretting money anxieties nnd the undcrcunent of real unhappiness ring true wo realise the soreness of his heart and dwell with him in sympathy of the minor characters there is little reason to speak some are good and some unconvincing but taken as a whole mrs ward has not lost ground by her present work rather does she steadily hold her own among the most important

the two families an episode in the history of chapelton new novels by the author of rose douglas 2 vols smith elder  co so favourableas may be recollectedwas our opinion of  rose douglas that another novel by the same writer could not fail to be welcomed by us with more than ordinary heartiness and curiosity  the two families will neither injure nor increase its authors reputation again and again have we been treated to the contrast betwixt riches without religion and poverty with piety displayed in one and the same family  but the one has rarely been set in array against the other in a manner more entirely void of offence or of those exaggerations which point out wealth as a crime and lowly estate as a virtue in themselves the spoiled child eliza wilson by whose hapless fate the moral of the tale is pointed is well drawn until the moment of her marriage the events connected with and succeeding to this egregious case of sale and barter are forced for the sake of effect we hardly believe that people represented to be so proud as the chamberlyns would stoop to court the parvenus heiress with so little veil upon their cupidity  nor do we imagine that any well bred persons would so nakedly and suddenly commence the course of contemptuous insult which this aristocratic mother and son are described as adopting towards the bride from the very moment when the church had tied fast the impoverished mans meanness to the ambitious girls money but there is a dismal reality in the account of poor elizas return home and the solace to which she subsequently has recourse namely the bottlecomes only too naturally by way of sequel to such an illomened and un equal marriage that to the bottle the coffin shortly succeeds is also in the natural duotder of such a wretched history we are less satisfied with the final distribution of the great fortune and apprehend that the authoress of  rose douglas has small experience of settlements deeds of conveyance c c though her conception of sacrifice and generosity is right royally munificent the country beaux and belles of chapelton and the noisy smartness of the glasgow ladies are not badlydone  but the invention of the two families might have been fully and sufficiently wrought out in a quarter of the compass of the present novel,novel_contra
a noble woman by john cordy jeaffreson in three volumes hurst and blackett perhaps mr jeaffreson did well in naming his story after thc one respectable piece of portraiture which it contains lint his nobb woman  is only conspicuous in his third volume and she is not born until the tale is nearly half told it is thc history of two generations put together with very little art and not much grace just interesting enough to induce a lazy reader to skim it to the end but neither pleasant enough in its subject nor skilful enough in its handling to keep him from thinking when his task is done that it was a task not worth doing the book is full of unpleasant people who do unpleasant things in prosaic ways the village doctor who is its hero makes his first appearance as an ugly booby a sort of modified dobbin and though afterwards he is turned into a paragon of virtue he continues to the end as uninteresting a hero as a novelist could well portray his son is also virtuous and uninteresting and all the other men of the story are vicious and uninteresting the women of the story are nearly all of them intangible creations if that can be a creation which is altogether commonplace but then the whole novel is a string of inartistic unrealities the surgeon falls ia love with a young lady and finding that she is in love with somebody else immediately marries another young lady who is desperately in love with him but his first love is his  spiritual wife after a fashion to which the most rigid moralist could make no objection but after a fashion that could hardly be maintained with decency out of the world of fiction the young ladys daughter  the noble woman  of the story is destined to be both spiritual and actual wife of the surgeons son  but her chief nobility consists in her readiness to comply with her fathers request that she shall marry somebody else and so be spiritually related to one husband and actually bound to another indeed though chief end of mr jeaffresons book if it had any other end than bookmaking seems to be to show that if you cannot marry the person you like you ought to marry some ono whom you dont like either to spite your rival or to please your father or to satisfy some other theory in one respect mr jeaffreson strikes out an original path he has written  a book about lawyers and  a book about doctorswhy does he not now write  a book about monthly nurses  his novel shows that he is quite competent for such work there is no sarahgamp talk in it but babies and the mysteries of their coming into thc world seem to be his favourite topics his heroic doctor is always answering bells rung by expectant fathers or ministering to women in their  trouble his village gossips delight in counting though months that follow a marriage and in though course of his novel he brings enough babies into the world to fill an hospital ward this is new work for a novelist and as most of the novels are now written by yoimg ladies mr jeaffreson

to herself ut though heroine noble woman though she may be is only a thread in the story and not though most important one she takes the proportions she would really have for in real life even heroines do not come into very marked prominence mr jeatlresons present work is a very pleasant book to read it has the air of being a real narrative rather than a novel there is excellent portraiture of life in an english county town with its small gentilities anil grave respect for county families the genial sunshiny peaceful lifepeaceful without stagnation and sunshiny without any sentimentalitv of pastoral innocence the careers of the two men who ave the chief personages in the book are worked out to their natural end and admiral devisd the moral pointed by the talc is one much needing to le

words but is made tangible by deeds and the story 1ms a healthy genuine reality which makes it channing stapleton and kingsford are friends the one isa country surgeon in good practice  the other is

old turbulent type named kilderbee cornelius kilderbee a winemerchant by trade a humorist and something moroevidently a real personage he hates the kingsfords root and branch not without good cause for they had done their best in the good old tory times to ruin him for political reasons or as he expressed it  make a felon of him in spite of persecution he had thriven and as his old enemy observed bitterly for every kick that the kingsfords had given him he had given a bite in return which from a man who held it as a creed that  a blow should j always leave a mark was only a natural result  this old man kilderbee has a niece in whom his heart is wrapped up she is lovely and womanly in her ways and stapleton loves her with all his heart stapleton tells his friend young kingsford of his hopes his friend replies by congratulations by prophecies of success and words of encouragement stapleton goes to the uncle of bessie tells him his intentions finds that it is a favourite project which the old man has long cherishedhis regard for stapleton dating from the days before j stapleton was born when his father stood by kilderbee and became bail for him to the bench of tory magistrates who were about to send him to prison and who had refused to accept a dissenter as bail for in those good old times  no churchman ever thought of entering a dissenters shop and no nonconformist could have shown himself at a parish dinner without causing a tumult this brave generosity from stapletons father who thereby had put all his practice as the county doctor in peril secured the gratitude of the whimsical old man and this kind action had secured a staunch friend to the son kilderbee gives a joyful consent to the young mans wooing but the young man finds that in the interval of the two days since he confided in his friendthat friend who had for two years been making secret love to bessie always stopping short of a  declaration had proposed to her and been gladly and lovingly accepted the character of hercules kingsford and his conduct in this matter are very clearly indicated  the mixture of baseness cowardice mercenary dealing with an infusion of real attachment to the girl so far as he was capable of it is given with a masterly touch and a knowledge of human nature that is skilfully displayed as well as true in itself hercules kingsfords character was a difficult one to draw so as to bc at onco true and yet redeemed from being altogether detestable poor bessie is only a type of many another woman who having the chance of the better man chooses the worse with a loyal infatuation which almost succeeds in imparting reality to its own fond inventions stapleton shows the stuff that true love is made of he stands bessies friend with her uncle and secures her happiness he stands bessies friend through life his own marriage his relations with his own wife with the woman he had loved are given with freshness and truth it is difficult to believe that stapleton is the creation of a novelist wo believe him to bo one of those just men who keep the world together and make it a habitable place in spite of successful impostors like kingsford bessie is a charming woman notwithstanding her mistake in choosing the wrong man  the wife of stapleton is a good woman and an excellent mother and her sons rise up to do her honour but neither of these is the noble woman of the story bessie has one child a little daughter the delight of old comee kilderbees heart who has her christened geraldine and geraldine grows up to be a delightful young woman the old uncle true to his creed of never forgetting either a friend or an enemy makes a will which is to be a practical wrong upon the man who has married his niece to all appearance the money is left to bessies husband in reality it is all bequeathed by a secret deed to the little geraldine and stapleton is the trustee the man kilderbee hated cannot touch one farthing the story up to the period when geraldine attains her majority is as interesting as a story need be with a truthfulness of narrative that gives the reader the sense that the characters are all real people a great deal takes place of which we have not the space to give an account amongst other things geraldines father has married a second wife the sister of his bank partner domestic treachery has undermined his apparent prosperity all is well prepared for the event there is a son some years younger than geraldine and born after the death of comee kilderbee the strong attachment and object of her life he is a goodfornothing worthless young man but geraldine believes in him her first thought on knowing that she is an heiress is to make a position for her brother to give him all the fortune which she thinks he ought to have had how her father driven to the verge of ruin under the appearance of brilliant prosperity trades and traffics upon his daughters love and dutyhow not content with getting her money he works upon her to sacrifice herself in marriage though he knows her affections are given to a man well worthy of herhow both the father and the partner treat her as a piece in a game of chessis all true enough and well told it is a domestic drama that has been played in real life as well as in novels mr jeaffreson had a right to work up the incidents for a passage in his novel but we entirely dissent from the use he has made of them to illustrate the character of a  noble woman a woman to be  noble  must have common sense and that still rarer quality in a woman a sense of justice in acceding to

princes8 helene von racowitza8 auto i biography translated from the ger i man by cecil mar constable  co princess helene von racowrtzas autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of george merediths novels and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of the tragic comedians in the memorial edition of his works it is now rather more than thirty years since the princess published that account of her relations with lassalle upon which meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained his explanation brilliant and masterly as it was omitted a very important factor after all the strangest action of the heroine of the story was not her submission to her familywhich had it been the action of one of his own heroines meredith would conceivably have praised nor yet her marriage with the luckless yanko for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion and a somewhat too com placent champion of her own part in the affair clotilde the princess as meredith represents her would have been both too astute and too selfconscious to have committed this astounding blunder but the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked lassalle whether the countess hatzfeld would have to live with them an incident omitted by mere dith who no doubt thought it an in vention of the princesss and the first thing to recognise about clotildes original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing in a spirit of in genuousness verging upon fatuity  this she writes of her present volume ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child the autobiography then convinces us that the story of  the tragio comedians like that of another lady of high distinction for wit and beauty curiously enough merediths next is to be read as fiction  nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them though not a few are discoverable the whole course of the princess helenes life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with clotildes she was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous dashing manner and she went on her way vaguely drifting spasmodically candid playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures it accepting these in whatever form they offered themselves with open arm while still a child she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life and carried them into practice bw she submitted formally to her parents choice where suitors were concerned s0 that on meeting lassalle when she va nineteen she was the typical  jeune file allemande incapable of selfdirection and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility durng the short period of her engagement to lassalle she wanted she says  to tell him all about my past life and my crimes against saintly morality  but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand no no for heavens sake dont let us have any pompeian excavations   and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the autobiography the pages that treaty of lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume but even without them it would be worth reading so great is the variety of the writers experiences her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed she handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence with the support of course of her exuberant vitality that she adopted at need or was ready to adopt the professions of actress physician artist journalist in turnnot without success or some promise of it in all she was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination and took up flower  painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time indeed there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writers practical ability and common sense it is not less remarkable though less engaging that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth the conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to lassalles death a narrative sincere and poignant but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks is puzzlingly absurd the gigantic edifice of the german empire must always she writes have seemed like a prison  to lassalle  i therefore ask whether we pigmies all of us were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny and need gthe spirit of the worlds history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the empire it is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is a theosophist who published anonymously some years ago a little book entitled wie ich mein selbst fand her accounts of the many notable persons with whom she has come into contact from hans andersen and bulwer lytton of whom the latter would read aloud from his own works  while  in especially poetic passages his alice accompanied him with arpeggios on the harp to bjbrnstjerne bjrnson the wonderful old athlete his beautiful white curly hair standing straight up are always vivid and amusing and it is surprising that in a book in which personal jottings play a large part and much that is trivial is recorded there should be

character so pure and saintly as that of this  waitinggentlewoman in the unclean times of kingr charles the second the many good qualities of this true heroine were a living contrast and rebuke to the evil days in which her lot was cast serious in the midst of the frivolous devout amidst the irreligious pure amidst the impure patient amidst the peevish and petulant refined amidst the rude and true amidst the false the calm current of her life however darkened and shadowed by the trials and troubles she bore was ever the reflection of the faith that solaced and sustained her this journal we i was originally written in cipher and we are strongly inclined to believe that the editor has not limited her task to that of mere transcription and modem orthography there is an unmistakable savour of modern usage about many of her words and phrases and the language of the nineteenth century is too often made to do duby for that of the seventeeth nor is this all occasionally we find manifest importations of modem sentiment and its corresponding phraseology from tennyson and other living authors these are neither obtruded nor paraded and are certainly not without a certain measure of fitness and freshness when we are told that the heroine  looks at them the while through a mist of the happiest tears that did ever stand in a womans eyes we are forcibly reminded of tennysons fine

the wood of the brambles by frank mathew lane this is one of the quaintest and most delightful of books  what to call it it is difficult to say as a novel it is hopeless for whatever plot there is it is almost impossible to disentangle and the digressions and conversations must to the orthodox purist in fiction be maddening and yet there is no other form of literature which it in any degree resembles however the question is of very slight importance in effect it is a wild turmoil of adventures which a moonstruck landlord goes through in one of the revolutionary risings in ireland why any of the action takes place or what it all tends to is something of a mystery but anyhow it is hugely funny and gives one a very suggestive idea of the reason why irish revolutionary movements must and do fail the peopleare nearly all charming in their conversation and their unforeseen doings for pure irish fun and inconsequence perhaps the chapter entitled 44 confessions  is the best in which the fireeating sir tim appears in all his swaggering and blarneying glory admirable too as a piece of satire is the passage on p 181 unfortunately too long to quote descriptive of the relations of the irish tenant to his landlord in short it is a book which it is hardly possible to read through at a stretch but which for dipping into at almost any point is perfectly enjoyable  the wvood of the brambles if you had lived at the time and in the country of the wexford rising had seen a good deal of it at very close quarters been hustled about by both sides warmly sympathised with neither and not been in the secret councils of the leaders your idea of the whole business would have been remarkably like the picture here presented by mir mathew in this sense it is very much like a contemporaneous record the effect of course is confusion and if you want a plain straightforward story  the wood of the brambles is not for your case but if you can enjoy the carrying out of a complicated method of fiction which forbids any regular plot but allows ample opportunity for the delineation of character we recommend the book to you with full assurance there is another warning however which should be given it is an irish story published in england but not specially addressed to english readers very little if any of the recent irish fiction has had them their likings their prejudices and their possible friendship so little in view miss barlow mrs hinkson and mr obrienvery dissimilar writers of course but all having won the popular earintentionally or not appealed to us by qualities and by attitudes to which we are never insensible by evidence of irish tenderness domestic affection and geniality by the charm of the heart and of the manners  every irishman said sir tim a very entertaining but indiscreet personage in the book before us  is a good fellow at heart though if you were to go by our conduct you would frequently doubt it the saying marks the difference between mr mathews ireland and that of recent novelists theirs may be innocently bowdlerised his is recklessly careless of english opinion he wishes to ingratiate none his own countrymen will know how to read it and so will others if they have some humour and an appreciation of the foibles of   the wood of the brambles by frank mathew lane 6 human nature but to read the wood of the brambles without these is to be saddened and irritated cruelty and incapability and confusion and misunderstanding and cynicism and vanity are all on the path you travel on your way through it and for your comfort you had best have an eye and an ear for the fun the delicious absurdities the occasional tender and unostentatious beauty these are there but from first page to last there is nothing sentimental and the tears for  poor old ireland  will be missed by many sir dominic the teller of the tale is a young man to whom fortune is unkind but you never feel he deserves much glory or success for he allows himself in love and war to be played with and we are more interested in every one else mr mathew in his original way introduces us to folks that never appeared in an irish novel before he claims for irishmen that they may not merely be hard to understand but that they may be complicated hence the rector and theophius too with his magnificent vanity his poetical fancies his doctrinaire revolutionarism and his cynicism but one sir tim is not new he is the incarnation of the old irish humour absurd mad irrepressible irresponsible and mr matthew uses him valiantly in his purpose of disarming us of that rather patronising attitude of pity with which the most sympathetic of english readers are wont to regard his country,novel_contra
max havelaar or thc coffee auctions of thc dutch trading company new novels bv multatuli translated from the original manuscript by baron alphonse nahuys edinburgh edmonston  douglas the dutch haareno doubt a number of valuable possessions in the east indies  that magnificent empire of insulind which avinds about the equator like a garland of emeralds as the favourite phrase runs and thc rest of the world hears so little and what is more cares so little about what is actually taking place that it generally assumes tranquillity and prosperity there go hand in hand and that the dutch a quiet shrewd peaceloving people do knoav j better than any other how to make colonies a source of direct profit rather than a dead loss to the mothercountry but on closer examination j this pleasing assumption proves far from true 1 the dutch so far from avoiding the mistakes which the english spaniards french and  other nations have made in dealing with distant j possessions have reproduced them in even an i exaggerated form and do not seem to have  learned anything since those days when by their j ultraprotectionist commercial policy and their  wish to retain unjust monopolies they rendered  themselves odious to the test of the world  that the bulk of the dutch nation does not  know what is actually going on in their east indian possessions we can well believe the  subject is far too complicated for any ordinary  i man to master even if he has the wish and  j application to do so but the difficulty is 1 much increased by the fact that the indian 1 officials desiring to make things look pleasant  do not or rather are not allowed to furnish  truthful written reports they may make any 1 number of verbal communications to proper j quarters about the extortions cruelties and f crimes of the native chiefs but woe to the a official who dares to put all this on paper his i doom is sealed a mere dismissal from office e j without pension after spending though best part of his life in the sultry regions of the tropics being the least punishment that awaits him it is a fearful alternative that here presents itself such indeed is the drift of  max havelaar the book placed at the head of our notice it professes to be a novel but a novel founded on facts the author of which we are told in the preface has boldly asked the dutch government to prove the substance of it to bo false and at the international congress for the promotion of science at amsterdam challenged his countrymen to refute him but up to this moment no champion has come forward to disprove what is here asserted and hinted at on the contrary mr vcth the wellknown orientalist at leyden who made a special study of indian matters declared that the author understates rather than overstates the truth and quoted vitalis and others who had published accounts of scenes and facts much more shocking than those depicted in  max havelaar the author wrote the book under the pseudonym of multatuli but his real name eduard d dekker formerly assistantresident of the dutch government of java at once became known and the hero of the novel may be said to be an idealised portrait of the author himself max havelaar then a man of superior acquirements finds himself appointed to a district in java as assistantresident or subgovernor and the first thing on his assumption of office is to convoke the native chiefs by whose aid the machinery of government in the dutch indian dependencies is kept going as well as the european official placed under his authority he tells them that he is resolved to do his best to promote the prosperity of the impoverished district over which his jurisdiction extends but that he expects the regent though highest native functionary as well as the other native chiefs will also do their duty and not by cruel extortions drive the population away and render the extension of cultivation a matter of impossibility fully aware of the existing abuses and conscious that the system cannot be overthrown by the efforts of a single combatant he endeavours to win over the regent and others by telling them that he will let bygones be bygones will not be too hard with them at first but at the same time will not tolerate injustice in any shape havelaar soon perceives that his conciliatory policy is of no avail the regents court has a large number of hangerson who commit all sorts of extortion and cruelties towards the natives in the depth of night the boldest of the injured parties steal to havelaars house ami beseech him to protect them from the tyranny of their countrymen but he finds it difficult to do anything for them when he inquires officially into the matter the complainants bearing in mind though punishments awaiting them from the hands of their native rulers for daring to prefer charges against them revoke everything they have said and offer the most humble and abject apologies the assistantresident goes home disgusteel with their cowardly behaviour and the poor complainants arc now subjected to all sorts of cruelties and tortures if indeed they escape with their lives havelaar soon discovers from papers left behind that his predecessor in office has also been a man resolved to do his duty but that he died suddenly how he died is known to his widow who lives near havelaars premises and fearing that the fate which befell her husband may also befall his successor she closely watches and questions every native who comes to the assistantresidents house at first havelaar attributes this to sheer inquisitiveness on her part until she tells him plainly that it is done for his own and his familys protection  in fact that she fears poison may be administered of course life under such circumstances is unbearable and havelaar fully believing that thc head government when made aware of the real state of the district will support him in remedying the evil puts the whole case on record and transmits it to though resident who for years has furnished the stereotyped statement that everything in the district is flourishing and progressing as rapidly as can be expected the latter is much annoyed about this report and desires havelaar to withdraw it but the assistantresident is resolved to stand or fall by it the consequence of this obstiuacy is that he is dismissed and that all attempts to obtain au interview with the governorgeneral for the purpose of justifying his conduct prove abortive havelaar goes to the wall and the poor natives continue to be subjected to the same tyranny us they have always been liable to under dutch rule in order to bring out the views entertained by a section of the commercial world in holland itself about the subject the author introduces a mr drystubble a rich coffeebroker and a great egotist who is supposed to be editing the book and commenting upon the facts and opinions advanced drystubble is u mean contemptible fellow drawn by a masterly hand who we trust may not be the type of a aery large section of the dutch nation the book is avritten with considerable dash and by a man who knows his subject thoroughly it will naturally provoke a good deal of discussion as containing charges of a most compromising nature against the administration of the dutch indian possessionsnot made be it remembered by a foreigner jealous of hollands prosperity but by a dutchman to the backbone anxious to remove what he considers foul blots from the national escutcheon  max hswelaar or the coffee auctions of the dutch trading company by multatuli translated from the original mss by baron alphonse nannys edinburgh  edmonston and douglas this is better than a good book it is a brave one it is an appeal to the public opinion of england as a portion of the public opinion of europe against the wrongs oppression and robbery of the thirty millions of inhabitants of insulind where the king of holland bears sway it is a cry of  stop thief wrung from indignation at the sight of unheeded and disregarded suffering it is an advertisement to europe that  there is a band of robbers between germany and the scheldt it may be said the picture is untrue it is exaggerated it is a libel it is the work of a man who conceives that he has been badly treated by the government that employed him and now seeks revenge by the publication of falsehoods it is not possible for us to say how this may be but we can vouch that every page of  max havelaar has the stamp of truth because it has the fire of virtuous indignation let us hear what multatulii have suffered muchhas to say for himself the real person represented by multatuli is mr douwes dekker who was employed for seventeen years as a functionary in the dutch government of java  and  max havelaar is the name under which the author describes his eastern experiences he has just returned home from insulind as the islands in the indian archipelago are collectively called and meets with a prosperous coffee broker mr drystubblea dutch dryasdust whom he asks as an old schoolfellow to become security for the cost of publishing his book mr drystubble a prosperous tradesman the co of the thriving firm of last and co coffee brokers 37 laurier canal purseproud ignorant and selfish refuses at first but on finding thal it might turn out to his advantage he consents if this drystubble be a representative of the trading class in hollandand as such he seems to be paintedwe feel very much inclined to wish for them the doom invoked in lord tkurlows epigram amphibious creatures speedy be your fall may the sea undana and god damn you all he believed his success in life to be the result of his  fear of god and the commandments he could  retire to his country residence in driebergen and see how it ended with others who forsook the lord  pray and labour  was a maxim of his  but he took the prayer to himself and left  the labour to be done by those who did not know the lords prayer he considered the man who has little sins if he gives anything to another moreover he adds  i never give in the streets that is a principle of mine for i always say when i see such peopleperhaps it is their own fault and i must not encourage them in their wickedness he does not tell us indeed that he sent fifty persons to the city prison with hard labour in amsterdam for begging but he takes care to inform us that  every sunday he gives twiceonce for the poor and once for the church he gives to the poor at the chapel door and robs them overnight such is the character who is drawn as a contrast to  havelaar or as he is contemptuously called hythe rich broker  shawlman because he wore a shawl to keep him warm  havelaar on the other hand is a character of the noblest type with a keen sense of wrong and an ardent desire to remove it by gentle means if possible if not by any amount of selfsacrifice we learn from this volume that thc system of government in java is administered under a dutch governorgeneral by dutch residents dutch assistantresidents controllers lieutenants but besides these there are regents and their followers who are natives these regents have no political power indeed  but they have an immense capacity for fleecing the people who are under them the regent is a kind of  dummy under the shelter of whose social rank and consideration  the coffee and sugar machines called natives  are most brutally treated unpaid labour is exacted buffaloes are carried off the peasants lands  if the unfortunate inhabitants remain at home they are robbed if they run away they are whipped if they take arms they are shot between the dutch upper jaw and the regents nether one the javanese people are ground and triturated till death or insanity brings relief the spirit of the natives is so broken and the punishment of remonstrance or complaint so certain and terrible that neither the victim nor the agent of oppression dares to cry out for redress though dutch residents and underresidents come back and live at ease at home near the hague whilst the everpresent native regents and their deputies are levying black mail to support their feudal and barbaric splendour  havelaar  says that the

of this book as the most important if the statements contained in it are true they are most damaging to the dutch government we who know that in our eastern possessions tortures were inflicted by native officials on indian peasants in order to extract taxes from them can have little difficulty in believing the statements of mr dekker directors of our indian trading company flatly denied the statements made in the house of commons by mr danby seymour of the tortures inflicted on the ryots of the madras presidency but these statements were afterwards proved to be true the government of holland were made aware ten years ago of the conduct of the agents of the dutch trading company but they do not appear to have made any inquiry into the accusations of oppression and cruelty brought against the officials of java the form of the book we consider to be inartistio not to say clumsy but the literary ability displayed is very great indeed the tale of said j ah and adinda in chapter xvii is a simple and pathetic story of great beauty it is an oriental pastoral which the author is afraid will be monotonous but which we rather think will touch a chord in every human heart the youthful couple grew up together and they loved but saidjah was poor the regent and his underlings carried off his fathers buffaloes and flogged him besides for running away because he could not pay more taxes so the young saidjah determined to go to batavia to seek a little fortune and he promised to return and meet adinda at a certain hour under the ketapan tree which saw their early loves he has returned and complains in his eagerness that adinda is not there before the appointed hour of meeting and he complained unjustly for neither had the sun risen nor had the eye of day cast a glance

johnny robinson the story of the childhood and sclwoldays of an  intelligent artisan by the journeyman engineer 2 vols tinsley brothers  the journeyman engineer who is known favourably to many readers by  some habits and customs of the working classes gives us a picture of the boyhood of a prosperous london artisans child from his infancy to the commencement of his apprenticeship to a working engineer to rouse and hold the readers interest the book makes just no use of the ordinary devices of romantic artists but achieves its purpose by a simple statement of the ordinary experiences of a boy who passes his earlier years in a mechanics home and in the schools generally frequented by the more carefullyreared children of our superior london workmen how johnny robinson fares under the penal hand of a worthy mother the birch of the kindly dame who teaches him his letters and the canes of the masters who ground him in the three fundamental departments of learning is minutely set forth for the enlightenment of leaders who like to study the ways and manners of our poorer classes and for the entertainment of such youngsters as those whom the book describes the characters of johnnys schoolmates are delineated and contrasted with considerable ability and in his enumeration of the moral dangers that beset the humble but respectable lads of our large cities the journeyman engineer  gives us some noteworthy particulars concerning a vicious literature that is specially provided for their entertainment and injury but while the effects of cheap literature have been chiefly beneficial it has like other good things its attendant evils and chiefest among these in the present day is the extensive circulation of the kind of publications classed under the expressive heading of  thieves literature these works which are having a most pernicious effect upon boys in the working class rank of life are published in penny weekly numbers and at the commencement of their present runwhich set in soon after the abolition of the paper dutythey were published under such general but suggestive titles as black bess or the knight of the road and  the dashing highwayman general titles however were soon abandoned and these works now appeal directly to the class whose minds they chiefly corrupt by bearing such titles as  the boy brigand the boy piratethe wild boys of london and others of a like character the sole object of these works is the glorification of all descriptions of vice and criminality the boy hero is invariably represented as a daring and successful criminal leading a life of pleasurable excitement admired and obeyed by men beloved of women and eventually settling down with a rich and beautiful wife and the other rewards generally reserved for the virtuous heroes of ordinary works of fiction the whole tone of such publications ia eminently calculated to turn the spirit of adventure which characterises english boys to their own destruction as it teaches them to emulate not the deeds of great men but of notorious criminals the extent to which these publications circulate can only be fully realised by those inside the working classes and speaking from an intimate acquaintance with these classes i can confidently say that eighty per cent of the boys in this rank of life between eight and fifteen years of age who do read now read works of this class cases in which boys are led to commit robberies through the perusal of these publications are occasionally made known through the medium of the police intelligence but these are a very small proportion of the number of such cases that actually occur such robberies being for the most part from parents who do not as a rule make them public the depredations of the boys who are thus led into crime are committed either with a view to obtaining money wherewith to purchase the books or to carry out the lessons taught in them by setting up as  boy brigands or pirates on their own account and in connexion with this point it may be noticed that there is one feature in the publication of thieves literature that directly tends to induce the classes who are its principal readers to steal with a number of one of them the first two numbers of a new work of the same class is often  given away and these works being written upon the most intense  tobecontinued  principle the result of this dodge is that those who commence to take in one of these works are almost invariably involved into taking several others of the same class asit would beagainstthe nature of a reader of thieves literature to rest content without knowing the result of the  terrible encounter between the boy king of the mountains and the chief of the black bandits at the most exciting part of which the last of the two givenaway numbers of  the boy king of the mountains had terminated and thus it often happens that one boy is taking in five or six of these works at the same time and as the pocketmoney of workingclass boys is too limited in amount to allow of the expenditure of fivepence or sixpence a week in one article and the teaching of the works which they read is in effect that no boy of the least spirit would for a moment hesitate about committing a robbery these boys often resort to dishonest means to raise funds for the purchase of their favourite books what mr hughes accomplished for the boys of our upper ten thousand  the journeyman engineer has achieved for boys of our working classes,novel_contra

the end of her honeymoon by mrs belloc lowndes 6s methuen mrs belloc lowndes has attempted in her latest novel the end of her honeymoon to combine the unravelling of a mystery with the planning of a fascinating novel an endeavour which in some measure detracts from our appreciation of both personally we felt on reading it that the classic remark  how happy would i be with either exactly expressed our sentiments mrs lowndes herself is evidently far happier when she is dealing with the love interest pure and simple than in drawing the villainous characters of the french police the character of her heroine is sketched with a delightfully sure touch which proves that she is as we already know well a keen student of her own sex nancy is altogether charming and very human in her imperfections we love her instinctively yet without knowing why the tragic story which the authoress has woven around the ugly tale which appeared in the newspapers last year of an english ladys disappearance from a paris hotel is in this case converted to chronicle the mysterious loss of one john dampier an artist and poor nancys threeweeks bridegroom the book deals with nancys subsequent adventures and from an artistic point of view we cannot help wishing that the american senator and his very perfect son had not appeared quite so opportunely to aid nancy in her search wve should like to have seen how she would have fared alone but that of course is unkind although when you reach the end and find how very easily nancy consoles herself you are inclined to believe that the unfortunate john dampier is happier out of the way the reader is certain to follow the solving of the mystery with eagerness although when mrs belloc lowndes attempts to make even us credulous folk believe that the entire french police organisation from the charming and courteous pr6fet monsieur beaucourt downwards hid the traces of a mans disappearance and afterwards lied about it simply for the sake of their own prestige it strikes us as a somewhat tall order the story closes by the very perfect american explaining to nancy in the style of mr kiplings hero  youd best take me for your new love a line of action which she is very ready to follow the distinction between the passionate desire of a mans love and the simple need of kindly tenderness so often characteristic of a woman is excellently brought out once you have begun  the end of her honeymoon  you will not want to put it down for mrs belloc lowndes keeps your interest unflagging and you are very properly left in ignorance of john dampiers fate and whether nancy be a wvife or widow until the last few pages  the end of her honeymoon by mrs belloe lowndes methuen  co 6s this is a pleasantly exciting story of the ossibilities and impossibilities of a mans disappearance in paris on the whole the plot is neatly constructed though it is hard to believe that the stranded girl would have blundered so completely over proving her story for instance we have to wait till the eighth chapter before she produces thc address of her old family lawyer and another five before we learn that she bethought herself of the rouen hotel where she had stayed with the lost husband  while tie crucial fact that the carriage in which they both drove away from the gare saint lazare was stopped by thc police and that their identity was noted  the fact which would have prevented the mystery  is not referred to again perhaps that is well for otherwise an eminently readable even absorbing and easily written romance would have been frustrated it is a novel of plot scarcely at all of character only absorption in the mystery could account for the curiously abortive treatment of saigas and the naive confidence shown in the chattering major dallas of scotland yard by the prefect of the french police but all who value a couple of hours recreation should be grateful to mrs belloe lowndes  the end of her honeymoon fiction by mrs belloc lowndes methuen and co 6s there is no doubt that mrs belloc lowndes will sustain the readers interest until the last page of her story is finished but at the same time it seems a pity that an author with the ability of character  drawing which mrs belloc lowndes undoubtedly possesses should turn her attention to detective stories however well developed those stories may be plots counterplots desperate chasing and hunting down of criminals derive their keenest interest from exciting incidents thereby placing careful characterstudy in a secondary positionin a position in fact where a careless retailer of similar wares might learn to dispense with it altogether this of course cannot apply to the present author strange to say the honeymoon in question ends before the first chapter is finished the whole of the remaining pages being taken up with the search for the disappearing bridegroom the scene takes place in paris during the time of a state visit from the russian monarchs french police methods are severely criticised and the whole of the story seems feasible until the final disclosure and clearing up of the mystery from the very beginning the police officials of paris had known the fate of the missing man but on account of the imperial visit secrecy was maintained for a year the young bride and her energetic american friends sought by every means in their power a solution of the problem the police told them nothing although all the time assuring them of their devoted zeal on their behalf yet the whole ghastly affair is related by the prefect himself to a major dallas who happens to be in paris on business it is told quite casually as an incident among others of the manner in which parisian police officials can on occasion muzzle their press with this exception the story is good but we trust that in her next book mrs belloc lowndes will give policemen and detectives a little rest,novel_contra

serious work  mary barton her first novel or  ruth or m wives and daughters or  north and south or those admirable short stories united under the name  round the sofa containing  the poor clare  and  the manchester marriage so it is with great pleasure that we welcome this new and comely edition ot her works which is produced under the direction of pr ward in the preface he explains that he has undertaken the task owing to the express wish of mrs qaskells daughters miss gaskell and miss julia b gaskell and there is certainly no one who could have performed it with equal grace and efficiency the first volume contains his short but illuminating biography and to each successive volume he has written a charming and discriminating introduction  his critical acumen only serves to heighten his devoted reverence for mrs gaskell8 genius and his knowledge of the times and places which she interpreted throws new light upon the beauty of her interpretation in 1838 when mrs gaskell was twentyeight years old and had been married six years she wrote to her friend mrs howett about some work which she had undertaken in collaboration with her husband it is practically her first literary work and in her letter she expressed her aim in doing it this is what she writes we once thought of trying to write sketches among the poor rather in the manner of crabbe now dont think this presumptuous but in a more seeingbeauty spirit and onethe only onewas published in blackwood january 1837 but i suppose we spoke our plan near a dogrose for it never went any further her first novel mary barton was not completed until 1847 ard her manner had changed and developed from the experimental poem but her aim remained for ever the same she wrote and wrote alwayseven to her last work wivesand daughters which was still unfinished at her death in 1865in a seeingbeauty spirit and therein lies her charm and her greatness that spirit was so much part of her nature that there is no straining after the effect of beauty there is nothing desperate about her attitude nothing forced and the circumstances of her life were beautiful fortune cast no shadows across the path of her personal experiences save such as are the lot of mortality  and the tame which suddenly encircled her brow before she had yet passed into middle age was alike unasked and undisturbing    her husband who had won her hand in the days of her beautiful girlhood was the associate ofthe best and highest thoughts of her womanly maturity  and the honoured name that she left was safe in the care of her dearly loved  daughters on such a life who would wish to look back  to it who is not ready to look up  yet sympathy and love enabled her to see the evil and the ugly and the distressing things of life without shrinking  beauty never became suspect she possessed the quiet strength and great courage which are needed to welcome the colour of beauty for that colour often makes the dark moment or the ugly sight by contrast more poignant in its effect a little story of hers called  libbie marshs three eras  shows this peculiar ability with exceptional clearness the spirit informs all her work in the little story it seems crystallised her treatment is exquisite in grace and simplicity we can think of no writer but mrs gaskell who could have held the poise with such nicety a moments lack of grip the slightest hesitation and the story must inevitably fall and fall heavily sordidness and false pathos crouch to catch ber for the story tells of a little crippleboy franky who dies and whose death brings a kind of sweetness to hie mother a crossgrained woman whom her neighbours dislike and establishes a bond between her and libbie marsh the sewinggirl who had come to live in the court and felt very lonely until she sent the little boy a canary as a valentine and became his friend so after his death the two women live together and libbie marsh  but this is mrs gaskells way of moralising do you ever read the moral concluding sentence of  story  i never do but i once in the year 1811 i think heard of a deaf old lady living by herself who did  and as she may have left some descendants with the same amiable peculiarity i will put in for their benefit what i believe to be the secret of her peace ot mind the real reason why she no longer feels oppressed at her loneliness in the worldshe has a purpose in life and that purpose is a holy ope apparent in this sentence lies the quality which saved mrs gaskell from sentimentvoid abysmand that quality is her sense of humour by the side of it george eliots humour pales to bitter wit it is as much part of her character as the seeingbeauty spirit the combination of the two how rarely they go together it ia only necessary to think for a moment to realise form mrs gaskells greatness it gives her the breadth of view which humour alone can give and balanced insight into character and so of the conflicting interests of masters and workpeople of rich and poor her treatment is always masterly and whatever character she touches whether it be the distinguished margaret hale or the unswerving john thorton or the nonconformist minister benson and his sister faith or ruth to whom the bensons give a home or countless others she is always able to endow that character with the charm of lovableness rarely as in the case of bellingham who has betrayed ruth does that quality desert her and at once her touch becomes heavy and her treatment prejudiced and unconvincing it is to mrs gaskell of all the victorian novelists that we turn to find the quiet beauty of victorian life george eliot was a little beyond her time and there was bitterness in her writing the brontes were too individual their novels read like prose rhapsodies on their personal griefs dickens paints with such a grotesque assortment of colours laid on so heavily that his people seem creations of his own genius rather than human beings though they share his tremendous animal spirits disraeli charms and bewilders by his brilliance and displaythe exact opposite of trollope who soothes us with his laborious care mrs gaskell was eminently of her age she alone among them was inspired by what was highest and noblest of her day others were stifled by it like the brontes or loved it and sneered at it liked thackeray or were brilliant at its expense like disraeli she waa kept from sinking into its placidity by her intense sympathy with what was best in it just as the other novelists as is more usual were saved from its lethargy by rebelling against what was worst in it the old order must change but it is delightful to look back on all that was gracious and comely in that old order and perhaps the best thing of that victorian life was the instinct of the family the thief circumstance had spoiled thackerays vision of that the angry man with the hungry look in bis eyesand had embittered george eliot against it without giving her the right solution to the problems which she saw but that family instinct informed mrs gaskells life even as it informed her work with what dr ward delightfully calls her sweet serenity of soul knowledge creates new responsibilities and problems arise quite simply from the effort to adjust these new responsibilities to the old framework now in the creed of the individualist and of the socialist the family is losing its old prestige it is the day of the young the duty cl the old to the young is more regarded than that of the young to the old life has become more complex and

  the camera fiend by e w hornung fisher unwin in this sensational story readers interested in psychical research will enjoy some forcible satire at the expense of official indifference or hostility to the aims of occultists the principal character is a german doctor desirous of demonstrating by photography the immortality of the human soul theorising that the souls departure from the body occurs simultaneously with death he vainly seeks access to scaffolds and hospital deathbeds and conceives that he is driven to the expedient of committing murder in order to photograph people in the act of quitting the flesh an asthmatic schoolboy courageous and honourable plays the part of nemesis and is a cleverly drawn character mr hornungs criminal savant is unconvincing and by taking more trouble he might have lifted his story above sensationalism as it is despite obvious flaws it has the elements of popularity  i the camara fsiend by u w hornung t fishor unwil os tdul interest in this latest of mr hornungs entertaining novels is mainly derived from a series of muiders the scenes of which the author ingeniously keeps out of sight thereby sparing the timorous reader many thrilling horrors indeed one of the murders is committed before the opening of the story  the camera fiend  is a teutonic experimentalist in psychical research who believes it is possible to photograph the soul but only at the moment of dissolution as he has been refused permission to photograph hospital deathbed scenes also prison executions he resorts to murder in order to carry out his experiments and test his theory of one of his victims an alcoholic licensed messenger he saysi found him asleep on a bench in hollandwalk and not another being in sight and i shot him    i had lost very few seconds between pulling the trigger and pressing the bulb of my pneumatic shutter but one had to get back into position for this and the fact remains that i was too late the result may be found among my negatives it is dreadfully good of the dead man if not a unique photograph of actual death but it lacks the least trace of the supernormal the flight of the soul had been too quick for me all the characters are lifelike and well drawn as is to be expected in a story by mr hornung his similes are witty his humour is grim and his tragedy is horrific we are told in a foreword upon the outer cover that an attractive love story runs through the book but we failed to find it there is not a kiss or a blush or a tender sigh in the whole volume but perhaps this is a little more of mr hornungs grim humour anyhow we cannot help thinking that love would be very much out of place in such an orrible tale,novel_contra
handbooh of the english tongue by j an gus ma dd religious tract society  a good idea of the present work may be formed by those who are acquainted with the  bible handbook by the same author when we

the propounder of novel theories his aim is purely practical availing himselfnot unfairlyof the researches of the most eminent authorities which he has spared no pains to master he endeavours to lay them before the student in a form at once convenient and complete if the materials are not always new they are invariably good dr angus may therefore fairly lay claim to the merits of wise selection and skilful arrangement if not of originality in the highest sense and yet far from being a slavish copyist he has so modified the results supplied to ms hand by the best writerssupplementing them with observations of his ownas to make his work virtually an original production we know not where else students can find so sufficient an account of the affinities and history of our language accompanied by so clear an exhibition of its structure and laws all comprised within such moderate limits he has done well in introducing so much ofthe anglosaxon grammar as is needful to enable the reader to trace the origin of our inflexions and study our older writers with advantage this we think a valuable feature as also the chapter on etymology the hints on composition too with the quotations from standard authors for the purpose of illustration and the appendix of exercises and questions add much to the practical utility of the manual we have noticed one or two errors which may be corrected in subsequent editions the hackneyed quotation from shakspeare  who steals my purse steals trash is here printed he that steals c the difference is not material but in quotationsespecially in a work of this natureaccuracy is everything again by some slip of the pen we are told that the period extending from the restoration to the middle of the seventeenth century was the age of dryden pope addison and goldsmith  a handbook of the english language for the use of students of the universities and higher classes of schools by r glatham md i aylor  co the study of the english language has of late received more attention and been pursued in a more philosophical spirit than formerly englishmen are beginning to feel the inconsistency of knowing less about the theory of their own tongue than of that of any other the conviction is gaining ground that the english language if not so scientific as the greek or the german may be made almost as valuable a means of intellectual culture in the hands of a competent instructor to acquire a critical knowledge of english the several elements of which it is composed the relative proportions of each the changes that they have undergone and the way in which they were at first introduced and have since amalgamated together demands a good deal of patient investigation add to this a thorough comprehension and ready command of all the terms of the language and it will at once be evident that no englishman can be really master of his language without having gone through a course of study beneficial as a discipline of thc mind and  fraught with information which a due regard j to national feeling must make him anxious to  receive the deficiency of inflections the numerous anomalies and the other imperfections which may be considered drawbacks to our tongue as a means of education are more than counterbalanced by thc fact of its being our tongue and spreading over so vast a portion of the inhabited world no man has done more than dr latham to place the study of english on its proper footing by his philosophical treatment of it he lins raised it to the dignity which it deservesand shown that while an essential in the earliest education of children it is not unworthy to hold a high place in college pursuits his present work is a sort of medium between his large and school grammars it is rendered much more interesting as well as more useful to a student than the school grammar by containing not merely a greater number of facts but also a more copious discussion of principles nnd a fuller explanation of though origin and reasons of particular usages on though other hand it is less abstruse and more practical than the large work on the english languageit begins with an account ofthe  general ethnological relations ofthe english language followed by a  history and analysis of thc english language this portion of the volume contains much historical and ethnological information it also describes the leading characteristics of the tongue at different periods and points out some of the tendencies of the present agc then folio about fifty pages on  sounds letters pronunciation

regulate the changes of letters in different connexions and the reasons on which these laws are founded with an explanation of accent and quantity the next part treats of etymology and occupies a much larger space dr latham having previously explained the principles on which though changes ot letters rest is enabled to make the reader easily understand how the apparently anomalous forms of the plural number have originated as the possessive case is not generally understood correctly wc will cite what is here stated on the subject thu true nature rf thc ge nitrc  ins it isa ciinmon notion

slavonic lithuanic and classical tongues the genitive ends in s just as it does in english  so that even if the words father his would account for the english wori fathers it woutd not account for the sanskrit genitive pad as of a foot though zend dvghdhars of a daughter the lithuanic dugtcrs the greek 6zovtoq  though latin dentis cc the whole of this subject of etymology is handled in a most masterly manner all peculiarities of inflexion are carefully considered and if possible traced to their true origin or referred to some general law it is wonderful how few inexplicable anomalies are allowed to remain after dr latham has brought his powerful analysis to bear upon them by making free use of the anglosaxon and occasionally of other languages he gives the reader a thorough insight into all the varieties of inflexion and formation his account of the verb is highly instructive syntax and prosody are the topics discussed in the remainder of the work   the former naturally engrossing by far the greatest share of attention here too a truly philosophical spirit prevails in explaining rules of construction dr latham goes to the root of the matter and shows the dependence of the laws of language upon those of thought he decides in all disputed or doubtful cases by a reference to the idea intended to be conveyed rather than to the external form of the words used we give as an instance the following passage from the chapter on the  concord of verbs  in respect to the concord of person thc following rules will carry us through a portion of the difficulties  littlein sentences where there is but one proposition when a noun and a pronoun of different persons are in apposition the verb agrees with the first of themi your master command you not ctmmanils  your master i commands you not command  to understand the nature of the difficulty it is necessary to remember that subjects may be extremely complex as well as perfectly simple and that a complex subject may contain at one nnd the same time u noun substantive and a pronoun the keeper he the merchant c now all nounsubstantives are naturally of the third personjohn speaks the men run the commander gives orders consequently the verb is of the third person also but the pronoun with which such a nounsubstantive may be placed in apposition may be a pronoun of either person the first or second  i or thoui the commanderthou the commanderin this case the construction requires consideration with which does the verb agree with the substantive which requires a third person  or with the pronoun which requires a first or second  undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leading idea  and undoubtedly the idea which explains qualifies or defines it is the subordinate idea and undoubtedly it is the leading idea which determines thc construction of the verb we may illustrate this from the analogy of a similar construction in respect to numbera man with a horse and a gig meets me on the road here though ideas are three  nevertheless the verb is singular no addition of subordinate elements interferes with the construction that is determined by the leading idea in the expression i your master the ideas are two ti the idea expressed by 7 aud the idea ixprcsed by master neveithcless as the one only explains or defines th othu the corstnution is the sime is if the idea were hai your hiashr i is in the same condition the gmia statement is made concerning the matter and it is intended to say what he does the word  merely defines the expression by stating who the master is ofthe two expressions the latter is the awkwardest the construction however is the same for both from the analysis of the structure of complex subjects of the kind in question combined with a rule concerning the position of the subject which will soon be laid down i believe that for all single propositions the foregoing rule is absolute pulein all single propositions the verb agrees in person with the noun whether substantive or pronoun which conies first  but the expression it is i your master who command or commands you is not a single proposition it is a sentence containing two propositions 1 it is i 2 who command iou here the word master is so to say undistributed it may belong to either clause of the sentence ie the whole sentence may be divided into eitherit is i your master oryour master vho commands you this is the first point to observe the next is that the verb in the second clause command orcommands is governed not by either the personal pro noun or the substantive but by the relativeje in the particular case before us not by either or master but by who and this brings us to the following questionwith which ofthe two antecedents does the relative agree  with  or with master  this maybe answered by the two following rulespule 1when the two antecedents are in the same proposition though relative agrees with the first thus 1 it is  your master 2 who comma nd you pule 2when the two antecedents are in different propositions the relative agrees with the second thus 1 it u i 2 your matter who command you this however is not all what determines whether the two antecedents shall be in the same or in dif fcrent propositions i believe that the following rules for what may be called the distribution of the substantive antecedent will bear criticism  pule 1that when there is any natural connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the second clause thus in the expression just quoted the word master is logically connected with the word command nnd this fact makes the expression it is i your master who commands you the better of the two pule 2that when there is no natural connexion between the substantive antecedent nnd the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the first clause it is i john who command not commands you  to recapitulate the train of reasoning has been as follows1 the person of the second verb is the person of the relative 2 the person of the relative is that of one of two antecedents 3 of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the one which stands in the same proposition with itself 4 which position is determined by the connexion or want of connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative  respecting the person of thc verb in thers proposition of a complex sentence there is no doubt  your master who commands you to make haste am not is in a hurry here i am in a h wry is the first proposition who commands you to make haste the second it is not difficult to see why the construction of sentences consisting of two propositions is open to an amount of latitude which is not admissible in the construction of single propositions as long as the different parts of a complex idea are contained within the limits of a single proposition their subordinate character is easily discerned when however they amount to whole propositions they take the appearance of being independent members of the sentence with regard to the use of the subjunctive mood dr latham lays down the simple principle that whenever both conditionality and uncertainty are impliedno matter what conjunction or pronoun or other part of speech is employedthen and then only the verb must be in the subjunctive mood we have a little doubt as to the correctness of what follows whenever two or more pronouns of different persons and of the singular number follow each other disjunctively the question of concord arises  or youyou or hehe or i i believe that in these cases the rule isas follows1 whenever the words either or neither precede the pronouns the verb is in the third person either you or i is in the wrong neither you nor i is in the wrong 2 whenever the disjunctive is simple ie unaccompanied with the word either or neither the verb agrees with the first ofthe two pronouns  or he am in the wrong he or  it in the wrong thou or he art in the wrong lie or thou is in the wrong we need only say in conclusion that the english student is deeply indebted to dr latham for this valuable addition to his labours,novel_contra

their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first

competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we

themie keller by the author of  george geith c 3 vols tinsley brothers  phemie keller has many of the excellencies that mark the author of george geith but it is weakened by a strain of sentimentality which mars the readers enjoyment and subtracts from the value of the lesson which it is intended to inculcate the introduction is charming phemie keller a beautiful young girl brought up amongst the cumberland hills sitting in the parish church of tordale and singing with her glorious voice the old psalms and hymns is a clear and welldrawn picture which the reader will carry through with him to the end of the book the interest once created is never lost capt stondon the lonely man returned from india and seeing her for the first time and feeling the old faculty of loving truly reawakened in his heart at the sight of her his accident among the hills his confinement at the farmhouse where she lives the curious household made up of such anomalous elements yet combined in spite of the scolding woman at the head of it by the broad and gentle love of the master are true and fresh aggland the uncle of phemie is excellently drawn  and the little sketch of his previous life is very interesting his quotations too are all apt and fresh and the reader will be glad to know them all this portion of the work could scarcely be better but when the writer begins to sigh and forecast coming trouble in ominous words and dark hints the book grows tiresome and irritating when the author treats the love of a good man like capt stondon as a species of misfortune for phemiewho though born of good family is dependent on the kindness of her mothers humble kindred and has a very hard drudging life of it with no opportunities for education or pleasure and when her idle girlish reveries about love and marriage the lover to be some handsome young man who is to take her away in a grand carriage and clothe her in silks and jewels is seriously treated by the author as a revelation of a better destiny for which it behoved phemie to waitthe wail sent up after the fading vision is utterly foolish phemie is represented as crying her eyes out when capt stondon asks her to marry him we are told he is considerably her elder that he is year for year quite as old as her uncle but we are also assured that he is a fine manlylooking noble gentleman and these vague unformed fancies containing as much vanity as presentiment are set up as serious obstacles which ought to have prevented the marriage it was says the author a closing up of the possibilities of her lifea pledging away all the long long years she had in all probability before her that she could never now become sinlessly acquainted with love  that she was resigning all chance of happy love love with its bliss and agony love witn its doubts and distractions love without which no life be it ever so symmetrical can be perfect this is the keynote of the book and it is not handled in a masterly manner the author being pledged to make phemie repent of course carries it out though what prospect a girl in her position had of seeing anybody worth this  love  is not shown they are all vulgar coarse persons the young men who come in her way and the love of a young girl seldom lasts all her life for the same person she marries capt stondon and onehalf of her dreams are realized she has more than all the fine clothes she longed for and her husband makes her love him thoroughly and happily if the author did not persist in picking her lot to pieces sighing here hinting there and lamenting the prosperity of her life phemie keller and her husband might have lived as happily as true lovers in a storybook the mistake the author makes is to treat with reverence as a solemn gift of the power to love that which in reality was nothing in the world but the power of idleness developed in the petted young wife and a very handsome selfish weak senti mental young manwho had no pith of character in him no sense of honour or energy but who drifted into temptation and stayed in it beca he liked it given the circumstances if phenus had married an angel she would have gos just as eagerly after forbidden excitement and romance her heart however never really swerves from its allegiance she loses her heul and her vanity is highly gratified vanity ana selflove are the only qualities brought intoplay by this great passion when she finds that basil has loved other women before hepself she is angry when she finds in after years that he could not remain constant bit married as soon as he had the chance she is disgusted and degrades her idol the scene where phemie is a widow and basil comes back as from the grave bringing a wife and a child with him is very good but all the remorse am the misery are overstrained and exaggerated not a reader who takes up  phemie keller  but could if so minded tell a tale of sorrow suffering and wild emotion but people have to live through those things and the mistake in  phemie keller is that the author makes too much of emotions that come and go and pass away phemies remorse for her disloyalty to her husband is not healthy and the miserable death of miss dermo just when her long constancy was rewarded is a piece of unnecessary illnature on the part of the author altogether phemie keller has a depressing and not a strengthening influence on the

literature prose fancies by richard le gailienne elkin matthews  john lane this is the day of the young men their star is in the ascendant the lines are fallen unto them in pleasant places no writer of the generation born between the forties and the sixties had ever such luck as comes of itself to the new crop of poets and essayists and storytellers now growing up around us the neophyte of those earlier days had to struggle on by his own efforts against enormous odds weighed down from above by the crushing reputations of the acknowledged titanstennyson browning matthew arnold thackeray dickens carlyle george eliot against competition like that what could youth effect the young mans heart failed him as yet the boom was not the logroller plied his humble art in vain the clique and the claque availed us nothing mr le gailienne i take it is well under thirty no writer of the generation of which i speak had made a reputation like his at forty save only swinburne and swinburne owed his first start in public estimation with re vereuee i say it not so much to his great and noble qualities as to his youthful audacity the men of the forties and fifties had for the most part to throw away on journalism faculties far superior to the production of those ballades in blue china and those proverbs in porcelain for which alone they could gain a hearing aad if in the end like thomas hardy they obtained at last by some work of genius some tess of the durbervilles an adequate recognition they obtained it only after long waiting and watching too late for it to produce that ebullition of youthful uro so beneficial to byron to dickens to swinburne hope deferred made their hearts sick with the grey sickness of pessimism and pessimism is the keynote of the men of the middle epochthe playful pessimism of lang the sombre and ironical pessimism of hardy with the new generation things have gone quite otherwise every day has brought forth its noble chance and every chance its noble knight the competition of the great gods having been suddenly removed we have seen the lists cleared for kipling barrie zangwill watson davidson the boom has become the rule it has rigged the market it began with anstie guthrie hugh conway fergus hume it has continued with conan doyle norman gale francis thompson we wake up each morning and find a new poet famous and the odd part of it is they almost all deserve it the times are favour able to the development and encouragement of budding genius the young man is no longer overshadowed by the giants of made repute the incubus of greatness no longer weighs upon him he is respectfully treated he is listened to with sympathy he is taught by kindly critics to take himself seriously and the result is excellent where he has anything in him he does take himself seriously as artist or as thinker and gets out of his soul the very best there is in it the last generation was snubbed into the banalius of anonymous journalism the present generation is led by the hand along flowery paths amid a chorus of praise up the slopes of parnassus what epics they suppressed those men of the forties what leaders they wrote in the daily news on though drainage of clerkenwell in the front rank of thoso young immortals not a few of us have long learned to place richard le gailienne he is a spoilt child of literature thc bookbills of narcissus took many critics by storm prose fancies will set the seal upon his calling and election i have never believed in the current critical doctrine that kicking was good physic for the young authorthat poets might make a fourth in the famous trio of a woman a dog and a walnut tree whereof it is well known that the more you beat thom the better they be for myself i can never remember that a single upward step on my path of moral progress can be directly traced to a critical kicking bather does it seem to me that what brings the best work out of a man is generous appreciation there is no knowing what tragedies and comedies we of the middle kingdom might have produced if only we had had a little of that genial incense let us take good care that the young lions who are growing up around us dont starve for want of it well prose fancies is a delicious book the title alone suggests the right name for a genre it is a book to linger over a book to remember a book to roll appreciatively on the critical palate it has the note of originality personality genius a provincial critic objected to le gailienne the other day that it would be better if he could be occasionally a little less obviously mr kichard lo gallionno and could servo up his tiontimonts plain without those garmshings and sauces which uiako ono think too much of the chef and too little of ones intellectual digestion to my mind that criticism has the rare merit of complete topsyturveydom fancy objecting to botticelli that his touch was too uniformly botticellian to michael angelo that one would like him the more if he could for a moment be simple and natural and human as it seems to me the great the immense merit of le galliennes work lies just in that peculiarity that everything he says bears in matter and form alike the distinct impress of his exceptional idiosyncrasy you may love it or you may hate it but there it isthe man himself his voice his tone his accent indeed this very pervasiveness of the individuality is the true mark of seership the personal equation counts for much our singer sees the outer world through the refractive medium of a poets soul and what he sees he says in the very way he sees it not only so but in these prose fancies as before in the bookbills of narcissus wo get a distinct element of personal and frankly autobiographical touches with many other men such touches would be sheer egotism with le gailienne they are etherialised and purged from that offence by i know not what strange undercurrent of impersonal personality and broad human portraiture he interests himself and he interests us rather as a specimen than as an ego rather as a unit of humanity than as the gentleman who lives in such a house in blank street it is our common nature speaking out in him that engages us but our common nature euvisaged through the optic lens of the poet and the artist thus the exquisite little idyll of  a borrowed sovereign is as frankly personal as anything in rousseaus confessions and a vast deal truer there is absolutely no tinge of concealment about it all is plain and straight as the thames embankment jim lent me a sovereign it begins and you have never a doubt as to jims realityhe is just jimor as to the historical character of the financial transaction thus innocently forced upon you indeed the very names of the two persons who form the dramatis personae of the pathetic wee idyll are ingenuously inscribed upon it what then so redeem it from any tinge of egotism why its utter want of false shame of essential selfconsciousness the prose poet poses himself as one of mankind and tells with an exquisite artlessness which is the finest flower of art a typical little tale of a minor act of selfishness and a minor repentance the whole thing is but a passing episode in three young peoples liveswe might all of us have lived itbut through it there runs like a crimson thread the sweet story of a girls love and a brothers sympathy the figures are by mere accident an i and a you in their inner nature they are a man and a maid a lover and his lass and a brother and sister the bookbills gave us a glimpse of a new master of style english poems to my mind did not quito redeem that promise i may bo wrong i may have pitched my expectations too high but in spite of souio exquisite little piocos of lyric verse i still think le gailienne up to dato has done best as a prose poet his lawlessness in rhyme and metre contrast somewhat curiously with the delicate perfection of his workmanship in his best prose writing but then i will allow that i am probably prejudiced in this matter by the long habit of teaching and writing greek and latin versewhich pleasing task occupied some six years of an otherwise wellspent life with the solemnities of senarii or the frivolities of elegiacs and i cannot entirely get over my feeling that poetry ought to be accurately divisible into fines and feet of so many dactyls and spondees hence formally perfect metrification like swinburnes and watsons appeals to me powerfully from the point of view of execution while i find it hard at times to reconcile my ear to the native linnet music of le gailienne or the irregular mocking bird note of john davidson however thu may be and i apologise for such strictly personal intrusion of my own tastes and predilections i feel sure that prose fancies is a work of the highest artistic value it shows a great advance on the bookbills which were hitherto the highwater mark of le galliennes performance especially in the direction of the management of the individual sentence and the constant bright play of wit and fancy here each clause tells a lustre as of sh t silk like the magdalens dress in ihe mantegna at the national gallery gleams perpetually through the woof of grave thought or high sentiment a nonconformist sterne a puritan jeanjacques our poet weaves over the strands of his ascetic creed though gold thread of a playful and fantastic humour not that even the asceticism must be taken too seriously as one sees it taken by the admiring wesleyan preacher lo galliennes is one of thoso poetic natures in which a high and almost ecstatic morality of sentiment is wholly divorced from the vulgar routine of practice ho sings of tavern nights with the voice of an angel he prophecies 4 woe woe over his oysters and porter  what a beaconlight of repentance   cries the enchanted pastor  i do love champagne and rumpsteak says the poet almost all the papers in this little volume are good like the undergraduate who was asked to name the minor prophets i decline therefore to make invidious distinctions but if i were driven to make a selection i should say my favourites are a spring morning life in inverted commas  the womans halfprofits and  the blessedness of woman au these are instinct with a certain delicate and elusive aroma of humour a bouquet as of the lightest and finest johannisberg but by far the most beautiful and touching poem among all these gems of lyric thought is the last in the volumethe sad note which closes a delicious diapason of poetic fancy it is called white soul and it fitly enshrines the memory of a pure and lovely life about which i dare hardly allow myself though luxury of speech everyone knows that tragedy what all do not know is the gentle and shrinking nature of the woman to whom her husband unconsciously dedicated by anticipation this sweet and strangely prophetic elegy i will not attempt to describe either it or her the poet himself has painted that shy naturehalf elfish half gipsylike with a touch of genius and a touch of second sightin one of the daintiest and truest fantasies in the english language i refrain from saying more those who read the book itself will understand why it is not so much a theme for criticism as for sympathetic silence grant allen  prose fancies prose fancies by richard li galiilnnl london mathews mr lc galliennes prose fancies is a singular rhapsody in prose fanciful and prosy as it is from end to end the writer is critical moralising satirical poetical pathetic sceptical sympathetic and cynicalin a word he is as it has been said  ali things by turns but nothing long verily to wade through these weary essays is a lesson in patience happily relieved by their brevity whether we look at the quality of their matter or their style with one exception wc are fairly puzzled to understanel what moved the author to write them and to publish them  for instruction or information of any value is conspicuous by its absence and the only amusement derivable is unhappily t the expense of their author a more extraordinary jumble of maudling sentiment rash and unfounded assertion semiblasphemous statements unbounded selfconceit dogged priggishness stilted style and nebulous phraseology it has not been our lot to encounter for many years such a nondescrijt motley might be worshipped with a very safe conscience witheut any breach of the divine command against idolatry unlike as it is to anything in heaven above in the earth beneath or the waters under the earth it is a thousand pities mr le gallienne did not stick to his poetry for to his credit it may bc saidand we really like to have something to say in his favourhe has written some excellent poetry and we can only account for the publication of this very silly work on the authors own jirinciples when in one of his essays he asks with truth  is it not e urious that the very follies we delight in for ourselves should seem so stupid so absolutely vulgar when practised by others  the last illusion to forsake a man is the absolute belief in his own refinement mr le gallienne himself is a singular exemplification of the wellknown truism here enunciated so much for the general character of the work and now let us look at some of its particulars in several of the essays the author seems to fall into a reverie or dream in which some beautiful girl or angelic being appears to him in one case it is  one of those discarded muses who sometimes remain upon the poets hands as fates and gentle reader can you conjecture the mission of this visitant it was to demand  halfprofits from the poet on the ground that it was she who had inspired him here is a specimen of this visionary visit as well as a fair sample of the authors pervading style  4 inelecel she had fumisheel the warmest anel the meist tragic colouring rondel however had for some time kept his address a secret from annette but the camile set upon a hill

xperien es of the world if a little boy is asked what he would like to be when he grows up he is here made to answer a man what funny little boys mr richard le gallienne must have met he classes publishers with knaves and poets with foels we trust for his own sake and for the sake of his publisher that mr rie hard le gallienne who certainly shines more as poet than as prose writer eloes not include himself anel his jmblisher in the sweejiing assertion that a  poet is a fool anel a publisher a knave if he does we must admire his straightforwarelness in another vision our author is favoured with the visitation of  a young girl in a dainty gown with a sweet blonde face but more character in it than usually falls to the lot of thc english girl now most admirers of beauty in women have seen more character in english girls than is to be seen elsewhere but as this writer says in his essay on the eye of a beholder  all of course depends on the eye of the beholder and we may add on his predilection to our mind however the most serious charge to be brought against this work is the tone of levity and irreverence to say the least in which the writer touches on the most sacred of subjects and the most cherished beliefs it is eejually silly and irreverent for examjde to write of the dead having long since given up all hoes ot the resurrection and to babble about the  angel gabriel himself dreading a bluestocking another striking feature of thc work is not merely the motley unconnected character of the subjects treated following one afier another without a single thread of interconnection but the sudden and rajid transition with which when writing on the same subjects the writer rounds from one phase of it to another reminding one of thc circusriders bounds from one horse to another at running sjeed his literary criticisms are ejuite on a par with his other idiosyncrasies he coolly puts a veto on the accepted adage of wordsworth the child is the father of the man this he denounces as  a merely verbal paradox which shows the poets ignorance of humanity of st valentine he asserts that  tradition has but two pieces of information about himnamely that he was beaten with heavy clods and then beheaded and likewise he was a man of exceptional chastity of character ste  if our author will only consult baring huilds llics ot thc saints and the western martyrologies he will find a few additional pieces of information of which he is clearly ignorant again fame we are informed  in athens anel florence took the form of a laurel here for athens our author should read rome for in athens  fame took thc form of the olive wreath not of the laurel verily it is dangerous to flourish a little knowledge may we remind him too that dr watts did not write a book entitled thc human mind but one entitled the improvement of the minda work by the way which contains some admirable rules for attaining the art of writing with simplicity in which our author is by no means proficient although he pro fesses to have an ardent admiration for  simplicity and seems to long for its return to the world it has left we trust he is sincere in the jrofession though it is sadly compromised by his own habit of writing in a style which is anything but simjde and intelligible one is puzzled to understanel what mr ia gallienne for examjde means by  the colossal

fishers river north carolina scenes and characters by skitt who was raised thar illustrated by john mlenan new york harper brothers london low  co skitt informs the world that his sketches are

fancy farm by neil munro blackwood and sons 6s i sot the first fewv chapters of this book we retained our hope that in spite of an unpromising beginning it would presently prove to possess something of that humorous charm that pleased us in daft days then we realised our mistake and set ourselves manfully to accomplish our tedious task of reading it through there is a captain cutlass in it a person of shadowy eccentricities there is a girl called penelope an illbred prig who seems to have read bernard shaw without understanding there is also another girl called norahlshe is the one tolerable character in the book there is too a poet another of those novelistpoets of whom we are utterly weary there is a storm and a broken ankle and a conflagration in the heroines bedroom the volume is we believe what is known as a  pawky book it is also a very foolish book quite unworthy of its author mr j m barrie is responsible for a good deal of really bad fiction as in the case of dickens his imitators appear to find it easier to imitate his faults than to reproduce his merits we hope that after this air neil munro will return to his earlier manner  fancy farm nobody could accuse mr munro of being unduly ccnceited when he declares at the very outset of this novel that he is going to record the diverting experiment cf sir andrew schaw to train the ideal wife in evern way he is as good as his word sir andrew himselfor captain cutlass as he is familiarly termedis a most whimsical character who combines in a bewildering fashion the mcst unpractical and at the same time the soundest commonsense notions in accordance with which he acts just as the fancy takes him we get a pretty shrewd notion of what we are to expect when we find that sir andrew who is now a widower married his first wife under a complete misunderstanding having proposed by telegraph to one of two sisters while he was under the delusion that he was courting the other undaunted by this mishap sir andrew announces his desire for a second wife and his recently emancipated ward norah immediately and in secret takes steps to provide him with the required article by inviting to the house a schoolfriend of her own complications promptly ensue sir andrew beaten in a curling match by the postboy undertakes to assume his duties for one night and in that capacity drives to his own house not the young lady who is destined for him but her companion penelope colquhoun the situation thus briefly outlined lends itself of course to vast possibilities sir andrew as may be guessed becomes deeply interested in his  fare persuades her to remain as companion to norah and endeavours to mould her as far as possible into a likeness to that young lady the whole neighbourhood naturally concludes that penelope is to marry the baronet with the single exception of one miss birrell  stop you   she says  stop you  and sir andrew will surprise you   fancy farm by neil munro 6s blackwood a fairly safe pronouncement considering sir andrews character and one not unworthy of the delphic oracle as it turns out miss birrell is right and everxbodv else is wrong penelope learns by chance what is being said by the neighbours and she promptly revolts against the notion that she is being moulded to a pattern even though it may be elegant and pleasing to her friends she sickens at the thought that all her recently acquired accomplishments such as riding lancing fencing the cultivation of a more subdued deportment and tone of voice have been forced upon her with this object in view and at the expense of her own individuality in a word sir andrews schemes crash to the ground just as surely as did these of sir austin feverel and we never like penelope better than at this moment when her eves are at length opened the conclusion is of course obvious sir andrew marries norah after all and penelope becomes the wife of mr reginald maurice wvho thanks in no small measure to her frank criticism of his verses has very wisely abandoned the role of a miner poet for that of an active partner in a big shipbuilding firm readers of  fancy farm  will we feel sure find eversatisfaction in this workingout of mr munros entertaining story despite the prominence into which she is thrust penelope is not nearly so sympathetic and so lovable a character as norah all the forcible and original savings which are put into penelopes mouth fail somehow to convince us and we are left cold by them with norah it is quite otherwise and we can only account for sir andrew having remained blind to her essential supericrity for so long a time by the presumption that he had not acquainted himself with the lessons of  the blue bird in addition to the leading characters whom we have named mr munro has added several of minor importance who are thoroughly skilfully drawn and the book is made up of many quaint episodes and expressions of pawky humour which should serve to increase the authors

list of autumn publications the delicate and joyous pantheism of elizabeth cheered like a summers day but the benefactress begins by being a little disappointing the radiance of the garden is missing we are in the middle of character studies batter than the average but lacking the peculiar atmospheric freshness distinctive of the writer then suddenly anna elizabeth under a different name comes into a property in germany and the authors special charm flows back in its entirety she is very lovable this anna with her childlike tenderness and simplicity and her quivering desire to mother the sad and comfortless ones of existence the proposal to share her home with twelve of these forlorn and lifebattered sister women results in some shrewd and rather humorously touching character sketches it is the personality of anna herself nowever that largely gives the book freshness the anna incapable of thinking an evil thought and whose natureworship was one of the most unstrained and poetic faculties under heaven  the reneactress by the author of  eliza beth and her german garden macmillan co may readers who were taken with the charm of  elizabeth and her german garden will be not a little curious to discover how its author can succeed in a regular and fairly lengthy novel like  the benefactress their feelings after reading it will probably be rather like that of the irishman on the subject of his pig which proved to be not so fine as he had expected but then somehow he never thought that it would the qualities which were most attractive in the earlier bookits sprightly irresponsibility and sweet unreasonablenesscannot be so conspicuous in a work written under stricter conditions of art and it must be admitted that what we lose in consequence is not counterbalanced by any new and unexpected excellences the novel indeed judged by the ordinary standard does not take a very high place the plot is indifferent the interest is seldom keen and the characters are not drawn with any great depth or vigour but it is savedand some will think even handsomely saved  by its genuine and unforced humour much can be forgiven the writer who possesses a real sense of fun and makes readers share in it and there are passages in  the benefactress which move one irresistibly to laughter on the subject of german life and character  their ludicrous side at leastthe author is always entertaining the sketches of the country parson the inspector and his wife and other of the minor characters though superficial enough are extremely diverting and there is that rarest of all creations a child perfectly natural in speech and thought by virtue of this humorous element together with a knack of bright and easy composition the book makes its way into our good graces in spite of everything and persuades us to a conscious and cheerful indulgence of its shortcomings  the benefactress by the author of elizabeth and her german garden the lady is also described as the mother of the april may and june babies which sounds extravagant on page 2 we read   at eighteen anna was so pretty that the perfect husband seemed to be a mere question of days the story tells of a young

feeling of wrongdoing reproduced from the illustrated edition of  elizabeth and her german garden by kind permission of messrs macmillan and co but it leads to nothingbut the disappointment of the reader after all the comparative failure of  the benefactress  in no way proves that elizabeth cannot write an excellent novel in this book she is hampered throughout by a rather aburd motif which might have been treated farcically with excellent effect but which she refuses to regard as extravaganza and tries to take and worse still tries to make her readers take au grand sirieux the comedy of anna estcourts grand philanthropic scheme would be bright and entertaining if  elizabeth  were not always pointing to the grim tragedy which underlies it all the snobbishness pettiness stupidity vulgarity of annas guests might have been intensely amusing or intensely hateful and therefore almost attractive in  elizabeths  hands it is neither it is just a little sad and a little pitiful and a little tiresome perhaps it is all very lifelike but only a genius of the highest rank can make a reader understand the pity of vulgaritv and the infinite pain of pettiness the benefactress is like  elizabeths previous work to be read for its pictures of german life and manners and its bittersweet sarcasm and half kind half cruel wit though she is hard  elizabeth never errs in her characterisation of the german countryfolk and as a picture of life of which the ordinary reader knows littlefor which he may render grateful thanks  the benefactress is crammed with entertainment and

until either the story or the journey comes to an abrupt end mr aldrichs sprightly and witty narration would carry his reader with unflagging interest through a far longer novel  prudence palfrey  is a short story and its winding up is so rapid that we can fancy it written as well as intended to be read on a railway journey and that the finale was dashed off as the train whirled screaming into the terminus  prudence palfrey is a pretty orphan heires3 of her guardian old mr dent the old gentleman was attached to prues mother and is now very much inclined to keep prue for himself altogether but mr dent has a penniless young nephew john and john falls in love with prue and she is more than half in love with him john doesnt speak to prudence but he tells his uncle all about it like a frank honest fellow as he is and when the uncle is very angry there are high words between them and john makes up his mind to go golddigging to california before he sets out the young people have one little accidental meeting remembered ali their lives afterwards john is too wise to ask for any promises he goes to put money in his pure and will come back for prue he tells her when he is rich prue says slyly but suppose i have married  old robin gray in the meantime and john replies generously  you are free to do it they part and prue waits heavyhearted till the crown shall become a pound and her john come back to marry her it seems doubtful however whether this will ever occur for john meets with a villainous chum who robs him of all his gains and escapes with the plunder leaving the luckless lover to begin all over again prudence waits three years uncertain whether john is alive or dead meantime old mr dent is laying his plans at home a new clergyman has been introduced chiefly by his influence into the old brick church the rev mr dillingham is young rich highlyeducated and of a serious disposition all the young ladies of his congregation set their caps at him he is charmed with the society of mr dent and his ward  though his manner to prue is never that of a lover and prue is a little nettled to find that she has so little power over the interesting and popular young clergyman therefore when one day mr dillingham suddenly proposes to prudence she cannot help feeling surprised and pleased and asks for a short respite to consider her answer the time allotted passes away and still prue wavers mr dillingham himself turns the balance how could he be so foolish as to select from all j the music on the piano that one little scotch song for prue to sing to him it is auld robin grey  and prudence sings with a strange passion breaks down and hurries away to her own room she can sing no more to mr dillingham that last meeting with john under the trees by the garden seat has she ever forgotten it  the old old love has come backfor ever up to this time the story has run on smoothly enough but now on a sudden john comes back a ragged wraith with a broken arm and discovers that the portrait of mr dillingham is the portrait of his villainous chum who ran off with the money bags and has since attempted to shoot john through the head on the same day mr dillingham absconds leaving a bleating and shepherdless flock and several damsels in despair and now discoveries are unearthed like potatoes mr dillingham preached from known authors mr dillingham had a habit of carrying off valuables from his friends houses  and lastly mr dillingham had proposed to and been accepted by a young lady a friend of prues if old mr dent is chagrined at his want of discrimination as regards the character of the enigmatical young clergyman he cannot feel more acutely ashamed of himself than does the reader of the story who has been completely gulled by mr aldrich to the very last moment the fault which most strikes us in the plot of mr aldrichs story is that he does not sufficiently explain though motives of the clerical scamp we are left to wonder what feelings on mr dillinghams part could have prompted him to come a wolf in sheeps clothing into the heart of johns family and why he sent an emissary to track and murder john if he meant to marry prudence and so possess himself of old mr dents money we could understand it but if this was his motive why does mr aldrich engage him subsidiarily to the other young lady who must eventually in any case have published his conduct and ruined his prospects  if mr aldrich intends the clerical gentleman to be a riddle without an answer he succeeds indubitably the story would have been a pretty and complete one and perhaps more artistic if mr dillingham had not been a villain but simply prues other suitorher  old robin gray but it would certainly not have been so excitingnot such a railway novel in fact there is one other character in the story which we must mention before we conclude it is parson wibird hawkins the old man who was shelved to make room for mr dillingham  who had been pastor of the parish for fifty years and of whom the parish was tired  whose dearest wish was that when the spirit of the lord came to take him it might find him in the pulpit of the old brick church who died very quietly on the evening of his abdication sitting in his study with his bible on his knees a brokenhearted man mr aldrich possesses a keen sense of the pathetic as well as of the humorous there are scraps of description in his storysuch as the old parsonage garden with its marigoldbeds and its little green bench under the vines and again the ruined fort on the hilltop with the varied landscape unrolling itself  like a coloured map beneathwhich though brief are rich and indelible we feel sure that  prudence palfrey  will be widely and deservedly popular m f,novel_contra

seventyfive brook street a story new novels by percy fitzgerald ma 3 vols tinsley brothers ix this story with a strange name the reader renews his acquaintance with jenny bell the courageous adroit indomitable adventuress the earlier stages of whose remarkable career were described in  bella donna and  jenny bell but though the same heroine figures in the three separate publications mr fitzgerald begs that neither of the two later stories may be regarded as a sequel to the first on this point his statement runslest the reader should suppose that the author was  trading as the phrase goes on the indulgent reception of a former work he thinks it right to state that neither  jenny bell nor the present story was meant to be a sequel to bella donna all three make up one storydeliberately planned at the outset and thus subdivided for the sake of convenience that mr fitzgerald is fully justified in thus announcing his series of noteworthy romances we can bear testimony but still his method necessarily renders the two later portions of the voluminous undertaking liable to the principal objections that are ordinarily advanced against sequels no reader can thoroughly enjoy the second unless he has read and remembers the first division of the tale and without a clear recollection of the principal facts of  bella donna and  jenny bell it is impossible to catch the full significance of the concluding story for instance mrs lepel on her first appearance at digby occasions more perplexity than enjoyment to the unprepared reader who is ignorant of jenny bells doings at the penwillion hotel and in like manner throughout seventyfive brook street her conduct will appear more or less unaccountable to spectators who do not possess the key which the prior narratives supply to her eccentric wickedness that the author would have done better for his readers comfort and his own reputation had he put the whole picture on a single canvas there is no room for doubt but after placing the three panels side by side and examining them as a single production we can commend them for their consistency of scale tone and treatment in each section of the tripartite work the heroines characteristics are admirably preserved the scheming governess of the first part is the same jenny who wins her husband in the second and after strange vicissitudes and humiliations dies in the third nor does the writer exhibit any diminution of force in 11 delineating the companions and scenes of her  later years with no less lightness than vigour he describes the life of the countryhouse where the adventuress encounters the man whom she strives to win for her second husband whilst her first choice is slowly drooping into death when the scene is shifted to brook street may fair the story is in some respects less satisfactory dr pinkerton is ably indicated nnd his conflict with jenny for the custody of her mysteriously stricken husband is given with excellent skill but no such doctor as cameron ever lived outside the walls ofa lunatic asylum and il is not made sufficiently clear whether mr lepel is languishing from the consecpiences of his railway accident or from natural failure of nervous power or from poison administered by the wife who would fain be rid of him in order that she may marry severne indeed we are inclined to think that mr fitzgerald lacked decision at this point of his labour and could not make up his own mind how far ho should render jenny the contriver as well as the wisher of her husbands death notwithstanding the defectiveness of this part however the book holds the readers interest and as thc wick d little womans desperate game draws nearer and nearer to a ruinous end the excitement of he drama increases after the defeat of her grand scheme at the very moment when its success seems most probable she never recovers herself but descends lower and lower in digradation and wretchedness and hearty praise is due to mu art with

missvings at the coincidence and follows to help em in case of need he arrives almost too late for he finds the ladies in deadly terror they have been robbed of all their valuables ana their unfortunate servant has been half killed by a man whom reuben from their description recognises as his companion he had made off on hearing some one approach reuben has the satisfaction of convoying the ladies home and calming their fears reuben resolves that the one burglary to which he stands pledged shall be his very last and that henceforth he will be an honest man the burglary at squire germans is successfully committed though the robbers have a narrow escape owing to the treachery of the footman their accomplice but they do escape and with a fabulous amount of booty reuben surrenders the whole of his share on condition of receiving the articles which had been stolen from the ladies and the promise of his companion never to claim his acquaintance he then formally takes leave of the  cross purposing henceforth to live entirely  on the square reuben naturally gravitates to the house of the ladies whom he has assisted in their distress  to restore their property is the

the neighbourhood makes an attempt to break into the house believing the ladies to be rich and their house defenceless little dreaming that reuben is their guest reuben of course knows exactly what ought to be done in the emergency and he does it it is a novel position for him but he is quite equal to the occasion when he finds the intruder to be his old master and late partner reuben has a moment of deadly temptation but he resists it and shows a good and generous nature his old companion will not profit by it he tries to kill reuben and there is a struggle in which reuben is hurt and his adversary receives a wound of which he dies which is a piece of great luck for reuben as it relieves him of a dangerous enemy and starts him with great eclat on the road of honesty but the past cannot be severed from the present at every turn he is met and baffled by some accident arising from his old life he keeps up a manful fight against all his difficulties he has friends in the maxwells and in a worthy old doctor who is their friend and the guardian of miss maxwell reuben shows many excellent qualities in fact he is so truthful and straightforward that it is difficult to understand how he had ever prospered in his old career of thief and rogue he however mars many of his chances by impatience at the last moment which destroys the good of all he had done and suffered but though often defeated in his efforts to earn an honest living he never relapses into bad courses having enlisted as a soldier he does his duty well but an experienced thief has by ill luck enlisted in the

benefit of juvenile readers   thc frog king  or iron henrythere xvas once a young princess and for a long xvhile she knew not xvhat to do to amuse herself at last she took a golden ball xvith xvhich she had often played before and xvent out into the wood and in the middle of the wood there xvas a bright cool brook and by the side of this she sat herself doxvn threxv the ball up into the air and caught it again  and this xvas to her as a pastime but it happened once xvhen the ball had floxxn very high and the princess lifted up her arm and stretched out her lingers that she might catch it that the ball fell upon the ground by the side of her and rolled staightxvays into the xvater the princess xvas frightened and looked after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy jewels thy pearls even thy golden crown itself are nothing to me  but if thou wilt take me for thy friend and companion set me on  we have not ottered an opinion on that part ol mr bulwers work which treats ol literature haviptt reserved hi views on thc subject sui a second notice thy right hand at thy little tallie j let nie eat with thee out of thy little golden dish drink with thee out of thy little cup and sleep in thy little bed i will get thee thy golden ball again how the princess thought in her heart  how this silly frog prattles  a frog is no companion for such as me hut must remain in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all her might j against it saying  now you xviii have rest enough you ugly frog  but xvhat fell on the hoot xvas not a dead frog but a living young prince xvho looked upon her xvith loving and friendly eyes and he became hy right and her fathers commands her loving

transformed into a frog that he xvas obliged to put three iron bauds round his heart lest it should break for very grief and misery noxv the carriage was to bear the young prince home to his own kingdom so faithful henry handed iu his master and the young princess and got up behind it awaiti full of joy at his deliverance j and xvhen they had ridden a little xvay thc j prince heard something

the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear out of the chapter of curses so

from generation to generation by lady augusta nod author of qwandering willie owen gwynnes great work c macmillan and coif this story had been written by an anonymous author we venture to assert that it would hardly have met with the favourable notices which have been devoted to it in journals not generally celebrated for special leniency it contains vivid pictures of scotch life and some happy sketches of scotch scenery but the tale is harrowing and melancholy and the introductory genealogy is as unsatisfactory as it is intricate there is of course in the old family of douglas a traditional prophecy and the prophecy is fulfilled in a manner which no one except all those who have read novels could possibly expect while blackcock shooting in a wood  kenneth douglas shoots lord douglas accidentally his cousin ronald is accused of the homicide by an old keeper and kenneth is afraid of confessing the truth poor ronald is under the imputation of having shot his father and his stern mother cannot forgive him he becomes however engaged to his cousin marion the only one besides the old keeper who knows that kenneth was the unfortunate youth guilty of the fatal shot  and the latter loving her accepts it as a punishment of his cowardice that she should be engaged to his cousin finally however everything is cleared up the engagement is broken off and all ends well this novel which is fortunately in two volumes only is fairly well written and sufficiently interesting but life is not merry enough to make us approve of a work so eminently calculated to depress ones exuberant spirits  fm t  ra ajz to cwlz ralik i vo1 by fjs auigustus i i i right i wc 1o not think very much of this story any way but ncvcrtheless one cannot help liking the author and feeling goodnatured towards her book she is so evidently a novice and anxious to please that one would be a churl indeed not to make the best of it to ones self there are some bright and fairly ielldrawn scenes too but mrs bright has not put her story well together we think she might try again and do better by the way two girls talk of a young man and say  all the same he would make a charming spoon does mrs bright know the meaning of the last word  we think not but perhaps her ignorance is to her credit,novel_contra
the clever woman of the family new novels by the author of  the heir of redclyffe 2 vols macmillan co as there are painters who content themselves with the simplest rural scenery and make charming pictures without going beyond the limits of a single grassy lane so there are novelists who can make ub take an interest in ordinary domestic characters and have no need to borrow much aid from historical incident or from the glittering armoury of fancy in order to excel in this minute and realistic school of writing it is necessary to observe with diligence and to delineate conscientiously  for the whole merit of the composition must lie in its accuracy of form and colouring miss young is one of our most successful writers in this particular sphere and it is evident that she spares no pains to discover fresh varieties of character or to define them sharply and distinctly for this reason her stories are generally worth a good deal of study though they may not be acceptable to those who like to read only of perilous adventures and terrible surprises the clever woman of the family is well written and teaches a good moral namely that it is bad policy for a young lady to set up for being more intellectual than the rest of her sex the heroine is a young lady miss rachel curtis by name who thinks herself a femme savante at fiveandtwenty and brings the power of her mind to bear on all who come within her reach in contrast to her there is a lady temple a young widow with halfadozen noisy little incumbrances whose gentle nature makes her submit superficially to the strong mind while her natural good sense and the presence of a protecting major prevent her from becoming entirely a victim on this ladys arrival with her six young urchins from australia cousin rachel attempts to take charge of the schoolroom  but all her efforts to teach the children are futile and she is obliged to give it up in despair not to mention the usual boyish disinclination to work which they possess in its most lively development these precocious young gentlemen look upon cousin rachel as a civilian and being themselves the sons of a general officer they think it scorn to take orders from one who bas never smelled powder miss young seems to understand the eccentric ways of boys pretty well but she scarcely appreciates the trials of the unprotected lady temple surrounded as she is by halfadozen young imps of mischief at first we feel a hope that she will marry major keith whom the boys respect as a military man and who is muscular enough to reduce them to order if they rebel we soon find however that the major is still attached to ermine williams a young lady whom he knew many years before but from whom he has been separated by family circumstances and by the vicissitudes of his military life this younglady is evidently intended to sit for the portrait of a really clever woman  for she writes numerous articles in the traveller and even edits it for a time while rachels lucubrations on curatolatry and other recondite subjects are  returned with thanks a terrible accident has rendered ermine almost a cripple and for a long time she steadily repels the majors matrimonial proposals though she has no strength or inclination to banish him from her presence how things are brought round at last we must leave our readers to discover by a perusal of the book but we may mention in the mean time that rachel finds her lord and master in a young officer named alick keith who subdues her by quiet irony as completely as petruchio overpowered katherine by violence there is some humour in the character of alick who never contradicts but shows his difference of opinion by feigning a prompt acquiescence  so that at last we find poor rachel exclaiming  oh alick why are you agreeing with me  have i baid anything very foolish  we are of course rather glad at first to see the haughty rachel taken down a little but we feel a touch of compassion when she has fallen to this fearful pitch of degradation  an underplot of some ingenuity is introduced for the purpose of clearing the character of a brother of miss williams who has failed in business and lives abroad he proves such an uninteresting individual when he comes over to england that we are not sorry when he goes out to the oural mountains again the cottage life of miss ermine williams her sister alison and their 1 ittle niece is prettily and naturally described but there is occasionally an overminuteness to which we must venture to apply the epithet niggling we may say the same of some of the conversations in which people say such very sharp things that the edge thereof is almost invisible to the naked eye upon the whole however the book will be read with pleasure and it has this great advantage over many recent novels that the author has evidently had some personal acquaintance with the phases of society that bhe describes  thte clever woman of the family by the i author of the heir of redclyffe two vols macmillan and coin miss yonges books we are transported into a somewhat mawkish paradise of earnest people everybodyat least everybody worth anythingseems to have every moment of the day occupied either in church services in reading solid books or in fulfilling some kind of necessary or selfimposed duty we can never think of one of her good characters as gossiping or smoking an idle pipe or even as playing at croquet without a set purpose some of thm indeed do these things but then they are the reprobates who come to a bad end and whose indulgence in these habits is but l the outward sign of their moral depravity the freshness of some of the characters in the earlier works of the author carried off the oppressiveness of this intensely moral atmosphere but we fail to find anything to reconcile us to it in the novels which she has lately written in the work before us the want of any relief from this is painfully felt and the purposeless anatomy of small feminine scruples and selfcommunings is carried out to a tedious extent the story is of the slightest turning chiefly on the subjugation of an energetic but perfectly unpractical young woman by a still more energetic officer who conceals his strength of character under a lord dundreary mask then there is an underplot of a damsel who is heartless and plays croquet and marries for money and is killed by a fall over a croquet hoop and some good descriptions of scenery and a large number of supernumerary characters who are all earnest and who all we must say talk and act like living beings and not like lay figures and make us think despite miss yonge that they must have other sides to their character than that she so persistently presents to us we cannot help thinking that miss young writes too much if she would but invent an interesting story and paint a central figure as interesting as was violet in  heartsease and refrain from that minute analysis of unimportant motives in which she is so fond of indulging her powers of description and dialogue and her thoroughly enthusiastic style of writing would stand her inl good stead in the meantime we can only say that the clever woman of the family  is neither better nor worse than most of the later works of the same author i,novel_contra

new nnovels pig8 in clover by frank danby heine mann frank danby falls between two stools the opening chapters of  pigs in clover give promise of an interesting study of english life on normal levels but we are disappointed on the entrance of karl althaus the south african millionaire several characters including a woman whose luckless blood is scientifically inherited from a demirep have a life and reality of their own but alas this does not carry us beyond the first sixty pages with karl althaus the nnovel takes a turn for the worse and becomes quite another thing with long lanes that seemingly have no ending and a mesh of characters and interests that are disproportionate and out of perspective there is for example mrs de groot who is described as the author of the kaffir and his master and who is also represented as making common cause with the prime minister of cape colony against the boers althaus is one of the hebrew millionaires who threw in their lot with the late cecil rhodes the advisability the taste and even the practicability of introducing contemporary people into modern fiction are open to doubt but we should say that there could be no question as to the verdict on the course frank danby has seen fit to adopt if through her delay says the prime minister of cape colony when the jameson raid is reported to him her damnable calm and red tape there is a hair of one of those mens heads injured ill pull the place down upon her i ii make hell through the length and breadth of the by continent this is the style in which he is made to talk to althaus and which should make the blood of history curdle karl althaus jew is a noble creature as all millionaires must be on the other hand louis althaus half gentile is a scoundrel and mrs de groot is a fool we

and faithless spirit bare before her yet never calls to the loving animal in her nature without shaking her with a frenzy of obedience for he is essentially belami a creature with genius in his flesh like the debauched journalist who prowls through de maupassants immortal pigstye there is no escape from his evil allurements save by death or flight imagine these women moving in the highest circles about the time of the jameson raid imagine finance in hundreds of thousands and controlling them a great softhearted jew who bawls that wrhen the jew is honoured as a jew he will shout in his synagogue  i believe in christ thank the great god i can say it now there is indeed plenty of bustle and chatter and actuality to persuade us that joan and aline are women of an unremote yesterday the vulgar references to gladstone are to ba regretted and it must be confessed that the identification of fictitious persons with public events is managed rather unadroitly one suspects a roman  def but there is neither losk nor key the strength and intensity of the nnovel however are beyond dispute  pigs in clover by frank danby 6s heinemann the two persons in  pigs in clover with whom one always remains in complete sympathy are the rugged greathearted millionaire karl althaus and the sad sweet little englishwoman joan separated from the dutch husband she does not love the soulless effeminate

insightso too is the unhappy aline hayward though towards the close when she is louis wife and when karl who has loved joan from the first persuades her to marry him having learned how she has been betrayed and deserted by the brother he now disowns it is difficult to believe that even aline could be so innocently impervious to friendly warnings while louis and joan renew their old acquaintance in karls absence and that when she finds joan weeping in louis arms she did not grasp the full significance of the situation unless we accept her as a wholly irresponsible imbecile alines earlier schoolgirl romance and its culmination in marriage smith the drunken jockey jack forrest are admirably well done and the hiding of that scandal and the farreaching consequences of it all help in the shaping of a well imagined and ingeniously constructed plot frank danbvs references to the late mr gladstones home rule policy are as gratuitously insolent as her shrieking admiration of the jameson raiders is hysterical but away from such debatable ground in south africa before the war in london financial circles in various phases of political and social life the story is convincingly realistic and is written with a skill and dramatic picturesqueness that should ensure its popularity  pigs in clovek by frank danby a long story of modern political and social life the father of the heroine was a rising politician whose career is described with frequent reference to recent political events aline makes a tragic marriage in the third chapter and then we are in the whirlpool there are jews

blondel parva we do not agree with certain minute philosophers who believe that the death of the devil would ruind the clerical profiuion but we really think that the romancist ought to thank good ness for the existence of vice and rascality for such spirits are as essential to him as the breath of life which he could no more dispense witl than he could dispense with bread and butter or the printingpress which is about the same thing indeed in a very practical sense there is to the storyteller a soul of good in things evil it is his peculiar function to take care that the evil a man does shall live after him though it must be admitted that the same function will not permit him to let the good he does be always interred with his bones hence is it that in every story which does not rise above a fair mediocrity of art certain almost invariable quantities of viae and virtue are re presented with mechanical periodicity in the dismalness of punishment or by the brilliancy of reward here for instance is another story by that indefatigable workman the author of l lost sir massingberd and other tal of a similar gustatory type  blondel parva has the merit of being in two volumes but it has the demerit of being com pounded of very common though fairly handled materials it contains as a background three rogues created from the seething rascalities of the turf by the way what rich stores of moral and tragic ambiguities the turf has recently produced for the use of future storyologists in the foreground of the picture are two brace of excellent lovers whose commiend desire to love and be loved to marry and be maried in shame fully interfered with by the sinister influences of the rogues in question and by other serviceable causes one of the lovers is a poor curate the other a literary barristera type of which is becoming quite popular among mitre of fictao though we are sorry to observe that they do not always cut an unh ble figure in the present instanck we ae hay to announce that the literary aracteris not only wholly yespe6 able but is one of the most effaient ators ix te diodu  bloai pam by the asceor of let la or gh two v loadon badbluq evams a co rarva  drama he is in fact the active pivot round whom mainly the incidents of the tale revolve and upon whom with the lady whom he loves they principally concentrate in the end two of the rogues die while the third lives and keeps the dramatic kettle boiling he is the evil spirit who would sacrifice everybody on the cloudy altar of his own infinite desires but as it is only the comparative degrees of evil that for a time succeed this man fails at once through the impolitic extent of his own heartless greed the action of the fates being somewhat slow on the side of justice virtue and love while he is enjoying his criminallygot gains nemesis in the form of the hero steps in and with a single blow shatters the wretchs dreams of turfy triumphs and social distinction the heroine is by this means rescued from the fastapproaching dogs of poverty and disgrace and the curtain falls amid a sweet flicker of hymeneal candles let it be said in favour of the author that his story is in a popular sense very readable it advances through its various scenes and acts at a good rattling pace none of the characters allow the grass to grow under their feet so that the reader is never in danger of falling asleep here and there too throughout the two volumes gleam out some pretty touches of landscape dewed with the poetic spirit put the weakness of the whole business lies in the fact that it seems to be the production of pieceworkas if it had been written to order according to a certain pattern and at the shortest notice this seems to be the method adopted in the production of a certain species of modern fiction the old elements are flung into a mill and turned out immediately spickaudspannewnew in the sense that paper is new while we know it to be the product of old rags the author of  blondel parva  owns a lively stock of his own and we should be the last to accuse him of lifting other peoples cattle yet somehow in his new story the characters seem old and familiar as if we had seen them a thousand times something of this kind is perhaps inevitable in all cases and any originality which is possible to a writer will only appear in the manner in which he puts his materials heaven and earth and all living as well as dead phenomena are the heritage of the painter but for every inch of canvas that is made immortal there are acres that in being only saleable sell the buyer of them and make unbeautiful for ever the walls of the uncritical philistines in like manner for every book that finds an abidingplace in the heart of man there are waggonfuls that after serving the temporary purposes of commerce fall decently asleep in the company of equally aomnific bedfellows on the shelves of polyglot libraries and other accommodating dustholes we do not see that we need complain of this if the majority of books iust necessarily sink out of human memory it is a distinct merit if any of them fairly serve their temporary purpose like dozens of stories published during the present year blonidel parva will serve its allotted span perhaps more eieutly hlau some of its fellows and then be heard of no more,novel
peg woffington  a nnovel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the nnovel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the nnovel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the nnovel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lnovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the nnovel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath  your neighbour is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutysir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane  it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles  a more touching scene is that between sir charles pomander and mrs vanesir charles is in love with mrs vane  now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband pomander  what madam all alone here as in shropshiremabel for the moment sir pomander  force of habit

own parts with skill instead of a poets clumsilymabel actors actresses does mr vane frequent suchpomander  he has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lnovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborn to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy  you would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a frienda friend  he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what cried he you recognised her you detected the actress of all work under the airs of lady betty modish lady betty modish cried mabel that good beautiful faceah cried sir charles i see you did not well lady betty was mrs woffingtonwhom my husband i know had invited here to present her with these verses which i shall take him for her and her poor little lip trembled  had the visit been in any other character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have i done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman  would he have chosen the day of my arrivalnot if he knew you were coming was the cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed  said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  my last letter written upon th roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly  read me the passage madam on which you argue1 poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish  i had but my husband and my god in the world cried she  my mother is gone my god have pity on me my husband does not love me there is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition the very clever scene in which mrs woffington imitates mrs bracegirdles acting and leads cibber to believe that the real bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as cibber was concernedwhat mrs woffington who had never seen mrs bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous apology  that this country has yet seen  the thing is impossible for cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last mr vane might have been

oswald cray qneald cay by mro henry wood edinburgh a  c black if mrs henry wood had done nothing else as a nnovelist she would still be entitled to the credit of having proved that two qualities which used to be thought incompatible may be sometimes found in conjunction she is at once amusing and prosy it is never an impossibility to get through one of her books but at the same time the reader always wishes he could throw overboard a good deal of unnecessary ballast unfortunately the least attractive of the two characteristics seems on the whole to be increasing with the exception of lord oakburns daughters which was relieved by the originality of its plot nothing that she has written has been so good as her first nnovel and notwithstanding our recollections of  verners pride we are disposed to put  oswald cray last in order of merit as well as in order of time mrs woods successes and failures may perhaps be attributed to one and the same cause she has an extraordinary affection for small details and up to a certain point her attachment is perfectly well placed when wisely used they impart additional reality to a story and give immense assistance to the reader in forming a clear conception of the people with which it is concerned but then there must be some care displayed in the selection of them all facts have not an equal value as illustrations of human character and the fault we have to find with mrs wood is that she persists in assuming that they have take for example her descriptions of womens dress we quite agree with her in thinking that the insertion of them may add great life and vividness to the portrait of a heroine but then they must aim at reproducing in the mind of the reader something of that general effect which exists in the mind of the writer in other words they must be real descriptions not a inere inventory of the contents of the heroines wardrobe in mis woods hands howevers they aplroach ivery closely to this latter type hiere are onlly a

this last piece of information might be of some service otherwise it is difficult to see what is the precise good it is to do him so with the other heroine isara is in evening dress a black gauze with a little white net quilting on the low body and sleeves or again sara wears a black crape robea little edging of white only on its low body and sleeves details of this kind might perhaps be interesting to people who know the wearer of the garments in question and had possibly seen her in them already and they would therefore be quite appropriate in a letter from one young lady to another of which the subject was the appearancon a given occasion of a common friend in that case the latter on being informed that  dear emily wore that sweet silk would be able to combine the subject and the predicate and thus obtain a distmet idea of the dear emily in the  sweet silk but the male and therefore ignorant reader needs to have his imagination assisted and some clearer notion conveyed to him of the effect of this happy combination nor again is every incident which may occur in real life suitablo for the purposes of fiction the art of the nnovelist is especially shown in the work of selection and combina tion mrs wood however seems quite ntisfied that so long as she is reproducing fcts she is doing afi that can be required of her a t petooswaldcray is devoted to the teacey of dr dayenals serant and for some time we are nstantly on the lookout for some disastrous consequence which is to flow from his unpleasant habits of reading letters opening desks secreting papers and inventing false charges but in the end nothing comes of it all ilia villainy is simply purposeless and the only reason mrs wood can assign for giving so much space to the narration of it is that it is but the simple truththe recital of all episode in real life she forgets that in fiction we look for something more satisfactory than the halfknowledge with which we are often obliged to put up when we are dealing with actual events we expect to see the connexion between actious and motives made plain and the moral history of crime traced out without this a nnovel would have no more interest than a report of a trial at the assizes with the additional disadvantage of being only an invention after all it is this newspaper style of writing which mrs wood seems especially to aim at and some parts of  oswald cray  might have been taken almost verbatirn from the notebook of a pennyaliner during the dull season thus in describing a railway accident she takes occasion to explain with most unnecessary minuteness how the news of its occurrence was delayed in its passage to the next station and this is the fashion in which she does it the telegraph clerk was a young man namlied james eales it was his duty to receive the messages and ini due course he oughlt to lave received the one from l1ildon siagnifving that the expected train called ill familiar terms at hallinglanm the seven oclock train though it camie in five minutes sooner hadl duly quitted hildon this message was due somewhere about twenty three minutes to seven and it came this evening as usual quite punctually no sooner had it been received than james eales who wanted to absent himself for a short while onl an errand to the town asked one of the men to take his place other messages might be expected relating to the trains not to speak of private messages always liable to come and thc inaii took the plaee accordingly as eales was going out the mani hlose nanie was williams called after huin to klnow whetlhr tilm trniin was signalled eales thought lie meant the downtraiii wlhosl signal was nearly due lanl replied  nlo not yet 13blt inl point of fact willianmis had alludled to thc uptrain from 11ildon which had been sigllallel that man was an accurate timekeoper it wanted two or three minutes yet to the siglnalling of the downtrail and lie would not have beeii likely from this very accuracy to inquire whether that message had comne it not being due eales who did not possess the like innate accuracy and was besides in a hurry to depart confused the quebtion and took it to allude to the downtirain now even if this mistake of the clorks had really causedl the accident this would be an absurdly verbose way of telling the story but as it happens it has simlly no connexion with it and the whole of this wonderful paragraph is apparently introduced solely for the sake of the moral lesson with which it concludes it is through these mistakes which arc caused half by carelessness half by what may be almoot called unavoidable misapprehension that accidents occur it did not lead to the accident in tis cwe the italics to borrgw mrs woods newspaper style arc our own but it has led to many a one williams ought to have said  is the uptrail signalled saying whiat lie did say ifs the train signalled eales should have answered time uptrain is signalled not the down mrs wood does not content herself1 ho1 e ever with giving extracts fromn imagiflaly newspapers she turns to good account her cuttings from real ones and actually introduces the death of the prince consort into her narrative of the fatal illness of ono of her heroines as thus is there any fresh news sir  yes and it is not good hie replied  repo sys that a telegram ha9 been received froo w indsor stating that there is no hope that tim prince is rapidly sinking his voice was low his manner subdued and raised his hat with unconscious reverence while b gave the answer walton lost her breath it may not be true sir it may n d true i i trust indeed it is rat but sir was there not hop this afternoon  according to the report that reached us these was could the prince only bear up this one night all would be well more than ten pages in all are devoted to this subject if the object were to fill up space we should call this sort of writing bookmaking of the lowest order but as each of the three volumes is considerably beyond the customary length we are forced to suppose that the author imagines that her work is thereby invested with the dignity of an historical romance we should not speak thus severely of oswald cray if mrswood had not already shown herself capable of something very different but it would be doing a real unkindness to the author of  east lynne  to allow her to waste her undoubted talents in the way she has done in the present work without at least making an effort to arrest her downward progress for the faults we have pointed out are not in this instance redeemed by any counterbalancing melits it is impossible to take any interest in the characters of the story except perhaps in sara davenaland in her only because we are told that she has the marvellous gift of being able to take her seat in a crowded omnibus  with quiet selfpossession  while for oswald cray himself every reader must feel a dislike approaching closely to detestation lie suspects a man of the highest character whom he has known all his life of committing a coldblooded murder and he breaks off his engagement with miss davenal not for any fault of her own but simply because he cherishes this groundless distrust of her father it is true that at length he discovers his mistake as by a very little trouble he might have done at the beginning and graciously takes the young lady back into his affections but even then he is only sorry that he should have been mistaken not in the least penitent for having acted basely and yet notwithstanding all this we are constantly hearing of his noble pride his grand selfreliance his scorn of everything mean or dishonourable so that our natural lislike is immeasurably increased by finding that he is presented to us as a hero in some of her other works mrs wood has been decidedly happy in the humorous characters but this element is almost entirely wanting in  oswald cray perhaps it was considered undesirable that a story which originally appeared in a semireligious periodical should have too large an infusion of the comic element we regret the omission because mrs benn the housekeeper at oswald crays chambers shows consideiable capacity of being amusing if we were allowed to become more intimate with her in one respect we are bound to admit mrs wood shows signs of improvement she writes less stilted english she still occasionally makes her heroes and heroines say i deem when the rest of the world would say think but this is now only the exception instead of being as formerly the rule perhaps after a time she may even learn that in speaking of a clergyman it is not customary to call him the i reverend m1r stephenson i i  oswald cray by mrs henry wood 3 vols edinburgh black oswald cray appeared in the pages of good words a periodical in which a writer of fiction is placed under some limitations whether mrs wood has not felt herself at ease and liberty or whether she is suffering under the fatigue of writing so many long stories with scarcely an interval of rest between them we do not know but it is certain that in  oswald cray her usual skill in weaving a story pleasantly and naturally deserts her oswald cray is dull and long drawn out the incident upon which the interest centres is so weak that the reader is inclined to resent it dr davenal is a celebrated physician in a country town with a widespread reputation for skill and benevolence sara davenal the heroine is his eldest daughter a welldrawn character as also is dr davenal oswald cray the hero is a young man who has been pecked off the family nest by his fathers second marriage and he is struggling to make his way as an engineer he loves sara davenal and has ascertained that she cares for him but before he has formally proposed for her to her father it so happens that a railway accident has injured a whimsical old lady a friend of the doctors and a connexion of oswalds she dies under the influence of chloroform administered hy dr davenals partner in spite of his prohibition the partner is oswald crays halfbrother mark to save the professional reputation of mark the doctor accepts the blame and responsibility of the act he waa out of the room when the choloroform was administered and the old lady had insisted upon having mark cray to perform the operation when her will comes to be read it appears that dr davenal is her heir she has left mm her whole fortune oswald cray had heard the doctor say that it would be fatal to give chloroform to lady oswald he jumps to the diabolical conclusion that a thoroughly good man of proved high principle has wilfully mismanaged the case and in fact murdered his friend for the sake of her money a malignant mischiefmaking manservant certainly insinuates the suspicion but oswald cray readily receives it he immediately decides that the daughter of dr davenal is not worthy to be his wife and he withdraws from her acquaintance in the most selfish and coldblooded manner without a word of explanation dr davenal resigns all lady oswalds money to the relations and thia act of delicate disinterestedness confirms the amiable oswald crays suspicions trouble comes to dr davenal his eldest son commits some mysterious crime which breaks his fathers heart and takes every farthing of his savings to avert the consequences to sara davenal he leaves directions what to do after his death but only vaguely explains the reasons crushed to the earth with grief for the death of her father and shame for the guilt of her brother which she can only surmise sara davenal is left in poverty and perplexity with the added sorrow of oswald crays desertion from some words which she misunderstands she fancies that oswald cray is cognizant of her brothers guilt whatever it may be and her answer confirms his previous idea that dr davenal had wilfully risked the life of lady oswald the treacherous manservant endeavours to widen the breach meanwhile mark cray oswalds halfbrother enters into a bubble mining speculation in which he persuades his brother to invest it turns out a disgraceful swindle and oswald has to bear his own halfbrothers disgrace as best he can capt davenal whose misdeeds have been the cause of so much woe comes back after some yearsthe husband of a rich heiress and in a very jaunty frame of mind it seems from his own showing that he had forged his fathers name to bills for a large amount and his father had redeemed them but the young man is very little ashamed and lays the blame on a companion he however frankly tells the facts to oswald cray thinking to set matters straight between him and his sister in the course of their conversation the truth of lady oswalds case comes to light and oswald cray condescends to ask sara to forgive him the mystery is for too slight to bear the procrastination in which mrs wood loves to indulge the reader is weary long before the difficulty is cleared up the collapse of the wheal bang mino is cleverly described but aa a whole the story is tedious neal the wicked servant is a weak and ineffective villain miss bettina the deaf aunt becomes tiresome caroline the foolish pretty young wife of mark cray is cleverly drawn in her adversity but she is not interesting oswald cray is inferior to mrs woods nnovels,novel
the lawyers daughter tiie lawyers daughter by frank trollope 3 vols london skeet 1873 fc though we learn from the titlepage of  the lawyers daughter that its author has already written no less than four other nnovels we regret to say that up to the present time so great was our ignorance of contemporary literature that we were wholly unawrare of his existence after reading the lawyers daughter we are by no means sure that we have any great cause for rejoicing at the enlightenment it affords us what is to be said of an author who gravely and without apology introduces his readers to venice in the seventeenth century and to all the paraphernalia of cloaks and swtords masks and daggers which have been the undisputed property of the london journal since the days of monk lewis  there is a melancholy helpless heroism about the action which at once commands our respect and moves our pity how little appreciation of the time in which he lives must an author have to whom the historical nnovel seems still a fitting vehicle for amusement or instruction we could scarcely have been more surprised at being asked to read a new  grand cyrus or a fresh chronicle of amadis of gaul than at finding an author as yet unknown to fame and we venture to presume young offering to a public that feeds on mudie a story which uses again all the devices and machinations familiar in the days of anne radcliffe or g p r james quite oblivious of the oftenquoted advice of corinna to pindar about sowing with thc hand and not with the whole sack mr trolloxe calmly reproduces in one single work all the stage effects of an entire literary generation bloody tyrants shameful murders vows of vengeance missing documents entrapped maidens duels and combats of six incessant hairbreadth escapes bravoes outlaws monks all these and other familiar machinery are to be found in the lawyers daughter virtue triumphs over vice too in thc end in the famous old fashion but even this attraction will not wtc are afraid ensure to mr trollope a large number of admiring readers were mr trollope a much better writer than he is he could not force the british public to an interest in this sort of thing now elsewhere it is different oeeasionally if georg ebers likes to devote himself to the manufacture of old egyptian and carly christian nnovels he knows that in scholastic germany he addresses a larg circle of readers who will like him all the better for thc fact that there is no one else living who could combine the ability to tell a good story with such appalling erudition if on the other hand m xavier dc montepin or paul feval likes to drop back a few centuries and to clothe his  hollow puppets  in some more graceful garb than ours  if the eighteenth century delight m amadce achard or the sixteenth ponson du terrail these authors know their pappenheimers and they possess so strongly the art of storytelling that they must always be vivacious and readable  their characters wear well the garments of aa ancient epoch and if they do not differ much from the parisian of today they move about with thc theatrical easo and grace which he can wear so well either before the world or at the bal de it opera but we in england must frankly admit ourselves inferior to france in storytelling to germany in erudition  in other words we want nowadays both the qualities which best excuse the historical nnovel as well as the willingness to read it our writers of the present day will not take the trouble which is essential to such a work  they will not labour like scott or thackeray or bulwer lytton and they do not produce a  quentin durward an  esmond or even a  last days of pompeii they are not of course to bo blamed for doing the work that suits them best and we should be very sorry to think that england boasted a miss mulbach among her nnovelists the epoch of the historical nnovel is as far as we can see passed away in england and  the lawyers daughter is scarcely likely to succeed when  romola  failed yet there is not wanting a certain feeling of pleasure in an age of robertson and jules verne of teacup and saucer and the fairy tales of science in finding some one bold enough to take delight in the good oldfashioned elements of romance and naive enough to hope for a sympathetic and attentive audience one quotation will be enough to give an idea of the work presently as the great beu of the campanella of st mark tolled though midnight hour two tall figures turned the righthand corner of though old wall of st francesco della vifirna muffled in large mantles  and almost aa punctually two other figures also cloaked carno round from though left and both parties met on the platform and saluted each other if not cordially at all events politelyeverything being arranged between the seconds and the combatants placed with a fair regard to light though marcheso dobizzi dropped the point of his sword and said in a calm steady voice addressing the seconds  this gentleman the count st felix has asserted that the signora bianca grimani was his paramour which foul slander i declared to be a lie and i now stand here to maintain to the death though truth of my assertion should it bo my fate to die i wish you gentlemen to observe should theso be my last words that as i hope for salvation i do most solemnly belie vo the assertion i have made to be most true while the marches spoke there might bo seen a slight degree of nervous agitation in the features of the count de st felix he seemed to press hia lips hard and though hand that held his sword was slightly agitated however as the marchese ended he said in a sharp tone  let us waste no moro of that chaste ladys light pointing to though moon  for in ten minutes she will bo behind though campanile of st mark and our shadows may obstruct us  ten minutes returned the marcheso coldly  will bo quite enough for our purpose  ha say you so then havo at you my lord marchese and though samo instant though swords crossed this sort of thing ought only to make its appearance now in the weekly instalments of some obscure periodical were it as veil written as if it were by the elder dumas himself it would not go down but when it appears in a threevolume nnovel by an evidently inexperienced writer the anachronism is only too glaringly absurd wc should like to warn mr frank trollope that nobody now cares about old venice or the doge or the council of ten about moonlight squares and sombre streets about mysterious appointments desperate duels and the fierce hates and fiercer loves which charmed our grandfathers and grandmothers neither the melancholy lover nor the wicked baron would be tolerated now for a single instant thc lantern jaws of the one and the buff boots of the other will not meet even with the kindly respect due to their dignified antiquity but only with ribald laughter or unconcealed indifference no one now cares to walk in that imagination street where thackerays j j loved to stray thc street where lnovely ladies look from balconies where cavaliers strike mandolins and draw swords and engage where long processions pass and venerable hermits with long beards bless the kneeling people where the rude soldiers swaggering through the place with flags and halberts and fife and dance seize the slim waists of the daughters of the people and bid thc pifferan play to their dancing who cares now for though fate of manfroni the onehanded monk for abellino though bravo of venice  whose eyes moisten now for thaddeus of warsaw or  looking on darkness see with horror the hideous effigy of death which makes udolpho terrible if mr trollope wishes to be read he had better either follow the example of his more distinguished namesake or make a hero of a gasmeter or a guardsman the path of literature which has been hallowed by thc tread of rhoda broughton he may not hope to enter on success there seems to be reserved for women but let him devote whatever talents he may possess to those subjects which the age will read to attempt to revive a taste for the historical nnovel is almost as heroic quite as hopeless and quite as ludicrous as would be the effort to resusitate thc niles of knighterrantry or thc institution of the courts of love,novel
in the year of jubilee by george gissing 3 vols lawrence and butler eves ransom by george gissing lawrence and butler mr gissing is one of the most difficult of all nnovelists to review fairly when a mood is on him he is relentless in its expression he gives us no relief from it a less able writer would bore us mr gissing never does at his worst he rasps us and makes us flee to fairyland from his terrible array of hard facts in his determination to suppress nothing of the ugliness of the life he paints lower middleclass life by preference he often forgets to take account of the sunlight which is as much a reality as fog if something rarer he feels too strongly to be simply accurate and all through his sincere and honest and merciless and powerful stories we are making mental reservations and combating but combating mostly let us admit the unessentials he forces us to acknowledge that the truth is generally with him this is a somewhat belated review of  in the year of jubilee which most of his readers will already have judged for themselves to those who have not it may be said that the title is significant of nothing in particular or of some truism such as in the year of her gracious majestys jubilee all was not well with england and with camberwell in particular it is a book which every writer and reader must respect marked by good thorough work a very rare knowledge of human nature the absence of all tawdriness all flabbiness in thinking and sentiment at the same time an event a very significant event in the history of the heroine one of the most attractive of mr gissings women is entirely incredible it is no good putting us off with generalities about the unaccountableness of human nature mr gissings business was to convince us that it happened to this particular girl for all he says we reply that it didnt otherwise the story is true cruelly true to a dreary life the hero is admirable if he were ever to become a good man at all it must have been in just such a way turning into one of the most insufferable domestic tyrants we have ever met with in fiction or life whose latter end of respectability is save perhaps to his own immediate belongings worse than the reckless cruelty of his earlier days artistically he is a great success we hope mr gissing did not desire to engage our sympathies for him into the story has been worked a wealth of sensible thought and wellmade characters more than we have room to refer to now but the object of a great deal of mr gissings bitter satire is worth calling attention tothe modern education which unintelligently applied contributes as little to the culture and growth of the mind and heart and soul as if it were conducted in chinese eves ransom is shorter with much fewer personages and perhaps less careful workmanship but unless we are bought and our judgement dazzled by the unusual ray of brightness at the end which made our hearts glad as mr gissings words seldom do it is on the whole a better a more harmonious story mr gissing hates poverty with a burning hatred that it makes for virtue he thinks an unholy lie as of course it is all our modern philanthropy declares the lie but we cant still in words so he gives his hero the chance of a few years cessation from rinding labour the chance of seeing life of feeding his mind and his eye and you can feel his glow of exaltation in his heros freedom but he does not let him have his swing he makes him fall in love forces on him a big sacrifice and gives him nothing in return but the knowledge that he has saved the girl he loves from misery and perhaps from degradation there he leaves him but with a song in his heart and the echo of that song we hope to hear in later nnovels for after all it is sung in the actual hard world that mr gissing faces so fearlessly eve the complicated young woman for whom the sacrifice was made is worth our interest mr gissing is one of the very few nnovelists besides mr hardy who dares to endow his attractive heroines with real live faults not only magnificent and interesting vices but mr gissing is apt to take up a scolding and sometimes a priggish attitude towards his women which is for all purposes absolutely useless this observation is however not particularly suggested by eve or by  eves ransom the story is a page of real life not the life that charms us but life at least and we are more understanding towards our fellowbeings after reading it,novel
james gordons wife nnovels op the week 3 vols hurst fc i blackett hero trevelyan by g m craik 2 vols low  co the author of james gordons wife has succeeded by sheer cleverness of writing in making readable and occasionally really interesting a story which in less able hands would probably have been insufferably dull for disguised as it is these volumes are and are meant to be a sermon the sin of intellectual pride being the text parts of the book particularly the reflections of the hero on arriving at a true knowledge of himself would read remarkably well in a discourse from the pulpit there is nothing like cant in them for cant is essentially insincere and there is a straightforward sincerity about this writer which commands ones respect even if its expression sometimes moves ones laughter james jordon is a genius who goes through eton and cambridge with great eclat finishing his academical career as senior wrangler and first smiths prizeman in short he is an intellectual giant and being far from unconscious of his stature he is not elated by the adulation of the pigmies among whom he moves he sincerely believes himself to be born for great things and deliberately sets himself to accomplish his mission in the eyes of his elder sister olivia hs is a demigod and worshipped accordingly in those of his younger sister cicely he is a prig and we think most people would be inclined to agree with the latter despising love as a foe to intellectual advancement he falls deeply in love with his cousin gabrielle wynn whom the death of her father has consigned to his guardianship struggles desperately against the passion which he fancies is degrading him but is of course worsted in the end and she becomes his wife the rest of the story is soon told after a year of unalloyed happiness mr gordon finding that his wife has become almost a necessity of his life resolves to liberate himself from her thraldom and if possible recover the selfsufficiency which he imagined to be his before he married her the coldblooded manner in which he addresses himself to this task regardless in his allabsorbing egoism of the possible consequences to the woman whose absolutely unselfish devotion he thus repays is cleverly and forcibly described the unequal struggle however does not last long and an attack of malignant scarlet fever which leaves him physi jally blind at the same time removes the scales which had darkened his spiritual eyesight intellectual pride is crushed and love is triumphant the stoic has thrown his philosophy to the winds and sits at the feet of his wife in the school of love here the book ends too abruptly for those readers who are interested in mr charles godfrey and cicely gordon both welldrawn charactersthe latter perhaps a little overdrawn apart from one or two vulgarisms which ladywriters seem unable to resist putting into the mouths of athletic young gentlemen from the universities such as  awfully down in the mouth c the style of the whole book is far above the level of the average nnovelist but it sins on the side of extravagance miss craiks nnovel is remarkable first on account of its title the quaint and certainly rather pretty name she has allotted to her heroine and secondly for the adoption of the gossiping or confidential style a proceeding which on social grounds we are inclined to resent whatever convenience or virtue may be latent in  i think  and  you know the confidential method of telling a story seems generally a poor substitute for making the characters tell their own tale and we prefer to base our estimate of them in nnovels as in real life upon their own words and actions rather than to accept assertions about their character from a candid friend neither is an author presumably upon such terms of acquaintance with the public as to expect a ready response to her friendly overtures of intimacy with this exception and the grand defect of wasting her heroine coram populo with the unromantic malady of hipdisease the story such as it is is fairly told we learn how a fashionable young lady much addicted to coquetry and somewhat brusque in her style of repartee is reduced by bodily infirmities to so gracious an attitude of mind as to accept thankfully the addresses of an admirer who plays benedick to her beatrice and to whom she at first disdains to accord her heart the gentleman who is as rough a lover as the lady is a petulant mistress begins with a strong aversion and contempt for the frivolity and coquetry of miss trevelyan but when she is laid upon a sick bed and a long convalescence gives him an opportunity of observing her character  swelling pity  does for him what it did for duncan gray and the mutual antipathy between these results in a cordial attachment there are some layfigures of no interest who fill the subordinate parts and this excessively domestic story is brought within the modest space of two volumes to an end where most writers would probably have thought of beginning we may remark as another peculiarity which might be worth the notice of intending authors tending to save much labour on both sides that the reader whose imaginative powers have never been pandered to by any uncertainty as to the events recorded is requested to supply that source of interest by  finishing the story as he likes this suggestion might be indefinitely improved upon a blank volume to be filled up as one chose would possibly be preferable to works of so slender a calibre,novel

reviews of books rachel ray mr trollope is one of the few nnovelists who make us forget the labour of criticism in our enjoymient of their books he throws off his nnovels with the ease of a man writing to some friend the latest gossip of his circle and seems as much amused with the foibles and humours of his characters as if he were laugghing at persons he had seen and heard and not at the creatures of his imagination this characteristic of his writing he has nowhere displayed more strikingly than in the nnovel before us it is almost a laugh from beginning to end marked here and there with touches of pathos effectively thrown in and though at times verging on caricature only violating the truth of nature to the extent of a slight exaggeration without plot and almost without incident we are carried through the book by the writers exuberant spirits and his way of turning to us the quizzical side of his characters but still more by the power with which he realises the manners the habits and speech of english life in their homeliest garb they are real beings who play their part in his story we have met them have spoken and lived with them we have sat with them in their houses have walked with them over the fields watched with them the setting sun by the churchyard stile and shared their loves and jealousies their weaknesses and their virtues we have seen before this cottage interior with its halfdozen books with gilt leaves arranged in shapes on the small round table where also is deposited the spangled mat of wondrous brightness made of short white sticks of glhss strung together with its shells and china figures on the chimneypiece the birdcage without a bird the old sofa the old armchair and carpet and the old round mirror over the fireplace we have some experience of mrs tappitts nianceuvres to convert a teaparty into a ball and win her lord and master by beautifully fine degrees to consent to one expense after another till the accumulation involves as an absolute necessity a still further outlay for which he is to be consoled by one of her best beefsteak puddings and who that has not been buried all his life in unredeemed bricks and mortar has not met mrs sturt the farmers wife who likes a young man who does the thing thats honest and is willing to lend her friendly aid to bring two young people together again who have been separated by the stupid interference of soured or silly meddlers  with such traits does  rachel ray abound and if it is not to be ranked though we doubt this with mr trollopes best works he has written nothing which will give his readers more thorough delight the design of his tale is to show how excessively mischievous overgood people may make themselves and that there is a practical malignity even about religion itself when it is pushed to an unnatural extreme with this view mr trollope begins by placing before us a lady very good and very weak whom he describes as one of those women who cannot grow alone as standard trees but for whom the support and warmth of some wall some paling some post is absolutely necessary who in their growth will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach while he lived mrs ray leaned upon her husband but on his death leaving her with two daughters the eldest of whom dorothea took after her father and was stem sober and steady the widow  immediately married herself to this girl who became thenceforth the prop against which she could grow but in time dorothea shared and became widow prime at the end of a year returning at the end of that time to her mothers cottage  black and stiff and stern to be her mothers prop once more mr trollope describes this womans character with great gusto prim and tidy by nature  it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance therefore she was rough with weeds her caps were  lumpy heavy full of woe and clean only as decency might requirenot nicely clean with feminine care her dress too was rough and black and clingingdisagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any wcmin which is worn day after day through all hours though naturally welllooking her desire had been to e ugly forbidding attractive almost repulsive so thats in ver truth she might be known to be a widow indeed she was t8ilf no bp

of future happiness on which her heart was set against this lady as against a wall whose support was  strong but not at all times pleasant leaned mrs ray to her own satisfaction but not quite to that of her younger daughter rachel who was neither weak nor stern but willing to take such pleasure as life offered her disliked mrs primes dorcas meetings and displayed  a little wickedness now and then to the extent perhaps of a vain walk into baslehurst on a summer evening a little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and whom she had seen a yawn in church or a word of complaint as to the length of the second sunday sermon the reader soon finds that in one of her walks rachel has seen  a young man this fact explodes like a bombshell in the cottap at braggs end and mrs ray holding the lupine theory with regard to youths of the opposite sex we see that what with her timidity on this score and mrs primes uncompromising enmity to happi ness of any kind rachers relations with the  young man from the brewery will be as little pleasant as it is possible for the two widows to make them but luke rowan the wolf in question is a youth of strong decision of character he has made up his mind to love rachel and that rachel shall love him which the girl is willing enough to do the day after mrs tappitts ball luke finds his way to braggs end and startles mrs rays confidence in her theory by the frankness with which he confesses his love and asks permission to visit rachel but above all by the way in which he takes his tea quite like a steady young man indeed she says defending herself against mrs primes remonstrances  he drank three large cups and if as rachel says he alajoes  to church regularly i dont know why we are to judge him anw say that hes anything out of the way the bickerings between mrs ray and her eldest daughter on this subject are described with the nicest discrimination of character and with an undercurrent of great humouir what is a higher testimony to mr trollopes power is the skill with which he develops rachels character in t conflict between the widows and the touches of purely natural and beautiful emotion by which he wins us to love her the dialogue between rachel and mrs ray after mrs prime has left them in which the girl tries to draw from her mother what luke has sai about her while she ran over to the farmers to fetch cream for the tea is one of the most charming of the many exquisite passages m these volumes mrs ray  so inconsequent in her mental workings so shandypated that it did not occur to her that an entirely new view of luke rowans purposes had been exposed to rach during this visit of mrs primes and not realising the fact that she had authorised rachel to regard luke as her lover while rachel remembers every word and begins to think that with hex mothers leave an intimacy with luke would be very pleasant but what was it that he did say mamma 9that is if you dow think it wrong to tell me i hardly know but i dont snppose it can be wrong for no young man could have spoken nicer and it made me happy to hear himso it did for the moment oh mamma do tell me and rachel kneeled down before her  wellhe said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen did he mamma and the girl clng closer to her mother a she heard the pleasant words but i oughtnt to tell you such nonsense as that and then 1h said that he wanted to come out here and see you andandand it is simply this that he meant to ask you to be his sweeheart if i would let him   and what did you say mamma  i couldnt eay anything because you came back bat you told dolly  mrs prime that you would be glad to ae him whenever he might choose to come here did i yes you said he was welcome to come whenever he plemb and that you believed him to be a very good young man and so i do why should he be anything else  i dont say that hes anything else but mamma well my dear what shall i say to him if he does ask me that question  h has called me by my name two or three times and spoken to me m though he wanted me to like him if he does say anything to like that what shall i answer    if you think you dont like him well enough you must toll him so of course c yes of course i must then rachel was silent for a mia or two she had not as yet received the full answer which o desired in such an alternative as that which her mother had southwest gested we may say that she would have known how to frame b answer to the young man without any advice from her mother bo there was another alternative as to which she thought it well tat d should have her mothers judgement and opinion but mamm i think i do like him sid rchel burying ber face beside the fresh young love of this comely girl and luke b w mr trolope gives us by

of a married woman with regard to money the tappitt family again call out mr trollopes powers of female portraiture which in the different shading of the three sisters is employed with happy effect slight sketches though they are the interview between mrs tappitt mrs rowan and mrs ray when the two former ladies visit the widow to represent to her the impropriety of a marriage between luke and rachel is again a proof of the ability with which the author holds his characters in hand and brings out their several idiosyncracies but perhaps the best thing in the nnovel is the pertinacity with which luke rowan deterniines either to drive old tappitt out of the brewery or compel him to brew good beer though it was a sour and muddy stream that flowed from his vats a beverage disagreeable to the palate and very cold and uncomfortable to the stonach tappitt made fifteen hundred a year out of it and to be told by a youngster that he did not know how to brew good beer was an indignity he could not put up with but the choleric old brewer is no match for luke cool and resolute at all hazards to brew good beer for baslehurst even if he is obliged to build a new brewery he threatens to do this and goes so far as to purchase the requisite ground then mrs tappitt seeing ruin staring her and her dauighters in the face urges her husband to take the thousand per annuim which luke has offered him in exchange for his interest in the old firm  till after much resistance and many resolutions to fight the battle out tappitt comes home from the dragon one night much the worse from eating  that accursed fish  and the next day sick in stomach and racked with headache lies utterly at his wifes mercy and consents to take lukes offer the scene in which this occurs is a capital domestic interior in mr trollopes best style if we are to find fault with this delightful story we might object that the artifice by which the stream of rachels love is disturbed is improbable that her mother would have been advised to make her write the letter which for a time clouds her joy and makes it doubtful whether the lover who broke in on her almost solitary and very humble life with such a sunburst of undreamt of happinessadvised too by the clergyman who had given such a sensible judgement on the question whether it would be sinful if she went to mrstappitts ballis notwethink likely that lovingluke as she did she would write it is less probable for rachel has a will of her own but that lukehonest straightforward manly lover as he isshould be put off by it should not feel the love that throbs under its air of prudence and attribute the love to rachel and the prudence to her stupid counsellors is less likely still but as this letter gives us two volumes when but for it we could only have had one we shall not quarrel with it and after all nothing is so flexible as human nature and to say that it will do this or will not do that under given circumstances is to forget how often it acts in contradiction to itself and again how often acts that seem to be contradiction on the surface are logical enough if we could minutely weigh the feelings from which they spring,novel
gentleman verschoyle gentleman verhoyle a nnovel by laura m lane in three volumes london sampson low marston low and searle 1875 miss grey the heros aunt dora acts as the authoresss deputy throughout these volumes she was alive at the date of canon kingsleys death and we have calculated that she must have been at least fortymanetho himself could not make her age lesswhen her nephew went to college and found  the newlyarisen tractarian party it would be an offence against all the canons of speculative chronology to affix a more recent date than 1845 to this epoch of mr maurice verschoyles career so that his biographer wrote or at any rate finished and corrected her work at the mature age of seventy or upwards she ismorally not bicipitally a muscular christian and her sprightly humour enthusiastic practical aspirations and fresh healthy tone of mind speak volumes for the preservative influence of the tenets of the sect when held by an old maid in very easy circumstances the book is written in  the gently didactic manner peculiar to maiden ladies and is a little too highly spiced with pious reflections but in spite of this and sundry faults of detail the book is pleasing and full of promise in fact if a sudden reverse of fortune obliges miss dora grey to take to nnovelwriting as a business and she will only deign to take the advice of her juniors she will by the time she is ninety or a hundred very likely have attained considerable popularity it is melancholy from a nnovel readers point of view to reflect how few sins there are after all for sensationmongers to work upon and how meagrely and samely stocked is the worlds chamber of horrors modern fiction has rung over and over again all the possible changes on themes of mystery and crime and is rapidly running through the impossible it is therefore quite a treat to the jaded reader or critic to turn aside from the beaten highroad of sensationalism to a quiet bypath where no fatal secret hangs heavy in the air no crime to speak of stains the sward so that with imagination 4lruined we can admire any delicate unobtrusive beauties which quiet humour and kindly sentiment offer on the way  gentleman verschoyle is eminently fr from the epidemic taint of the nnovels of the period positively a case of manslaughter by a railway company is the only crime necessary to the progress of the plot and  gentleman verschoyles only exhibitions of active muscularity are leaping a hedge which be could not see over vol i p 230 and knocking down a factory bully vol ii p 288 the avowed object of the story is to illustrate the moral power of the spirit of love the magical power of sweet affections in a nnovel we venture to think that the constant ascription of all good influences to god is as ut of place as would be elaborate psychological analysis now as miss grey gives us three or four conversations with a very worthy vicar not to mention a short sermon of his she might with advantage have made these passages the vehicle of her religious theories and left the rest of the story to point its own moral without explicit indications of divine interference there is plenty of room to moralise without venturing outside the sphere of human motives and mundane circumstances the portrayal and comparison of appearances and the discovery of deeper appearances hidden behind the more prominent is enough for the nnovelist without plunging into the abyss of realities though we cannot agree with miss greys religious theories nor think them very consistent still a form of religion which endeavours to accommodate itself to human feelings and institutions is more bearable in nnovel or elsewhere than the more bilious or hysterical varieties the hero  was no  saint no unnatural specimen of hothouse piety he displayed no unhealthy aptitude for religious phraseology a very mild little clergyman who remonstrated with him for leading his class of artisans upon the dangerous quicksands of poetry and science is promptly suppressed miss grey seems to have a suspicion that she  may have paused too often to moralise and prays her readers if they find this and other faults  forgive the prosiness of an old womans story my venerable madam permit a comparatively young critic to say that if you will be so very juvenile in your ideas if you advocate imprudent marriages and higher education of women if you indulge occasionally in slang and in your views about society and politics are altogether so unconventionally liberal we must forget your age and imagine you to be a young lady who on her debut in the role of authoress claims indulgence for her untempered enthusiasm and her inexperience the plot is straightforward and fairly compact miss lane we prefix the maiden title under correction has displayed considerable power of concentration in the delineation of some of her characters of five principal characters a laudably short allowance four are clearly conceived and their individuality well brought out by a judicious treatment of delicate shades of colour agatha and dora grey are introduced as heiresses living with their uncle a wealthy city man dora is plain and longs  for a full life  of practical usefulness and spiritual and intellectual advancement agatha a stately beauty  born to fill a high position is all for society and admiration a wealthy relation vulgar but fashionable opportunely turns up and brings her out dora finds a lover in a young curate only to lose him by death early in the book before agatha makes a lovematch with a handsome wellborn guardsman with no money only two hundred pounds of his own and an allowance of six hundred ayear from sir joyce before they have been many years married philip verschoyle is filled in a railway accident and the hero is born immediately dora henceforth lives with her sister and helps to rear the widows sole remaining treasure in her village home mother and son are devotedly attached and she hopes and longs to have him always by her and make him an idle  gentleman  like his father but maurice soon exhibits irrepressible energy of character and a longing for fellowship and a wider field for action the gradual dissipation of the fond mothers illusions as her darlings manly independence step by step developes itself is remarkably well depicted just before the young enthusiast y g for wide human interests is retuning from oxford where he is chilled by indifference or narrow mindedness on all sides his mother takes it into her head to patronise an invalid young lady of better birth than mrs verschoyle but who is niece to the principal farmer on the estate she somewhat rudely insists upon her paying her a long visit not intending to treat her as an equel nor dreaming that her noble boy would fall in love with a farmers niece of course he does his mother overhears their mutual avowal just as maurice starts for gibraltar of which a clever but rather irksome description is given her unkindness drives the girl to run away to town and the vicar recalls maurice to vindicate her character his mother mortified at seeing him staunch to his love promptly disowns him the police find and he marries hope the young couple struggle on in lodgings maurice working for wages at a factory with a view to becoming a civil engineer eventually he becomes a partner and on his being run over and nearly killed his mother is reconciled to him it will be seen from this rough outline that the main interest of the story is of that elevated kind which depends on the natural development of character under the influence of ordinary circumstances agatha verschoyle we venture to think has not a sufficiently coherent individuality we fancied that she was so transformed by lher love for her husband and for her child that we wvere unprepared for her outrageous conduct with respect to hope in other respects the btory runs smoothly enough the byplay of which we have purposely given nu sketclb contains some nice touches of pathos though the principles of the book are advanced liberalism there appears throughoutta staunch support of the established church and we fancy that we can detect a lingering reverence for  blood  and high position canon kingsleys views were essentially a compromise and here we have him in petticoats maurice is intended to marry beneath him and become in externals at least a conmmon workman  but he marries a thorough lady as well born as himself and the  workmans wages on which hec and his wife subsist for four years are found on calculation to be two hundred pounds ayear or more if ladies choose to describe pugilistic matters they should either study fistiana or get male advice on the subject so as to avoid the error of suggesting that the scientific use of the fists is likely to be taught by  lessons from monsieur de paris in the noble art of the fence  vol ii p 291 when the nominal narrator leaves the room in the middle of a conversation but still reports it verbatim without a word of explanation whence her knowledge is derived the ludicrous idea that she listened at the keyhole irresistibly obtrudes itself see vol i p 252 such little crudities will it is to be hoped disappear with practice and as the authoress theories become more mature and congruous we trust she will widen her sphere of usefulness by leaving the religious element out of her compositions as nmany earnest christians have been content to do before her with no other alteration than the erasure of a multitude of devout but unnecessary sentiments the attractiveness of the nnovel before us might have been doubled there is surely a consciousness of a reserve of power and abundance of material in a writer who depicts her hero when his love is hidden away in london leaving the matter in the hands of the detective police and at the advice of his old tutor occupying his mind with a course of history here is material for three volumes deliberately sacrificed is this meant for a sly thrust at certain popular nnovelists  whether or no the resolution to resist such a fascinating temptation is to be highly commended we see no reason why miss lane should not take a bolder flight and try her hand on some more complex characters but we advise her not to repeat so bold an experiment as the impersonation of an old lady of seventy years personally we have a prejudice against conducting a narrative by deputy as also against such devices for simplifying the construction of a plot as  extract from my diary,novel

the deud secret new hnovels by wilkie collins 2 vols cranbury  vanswo injustice will be done to mr colling if we trace the outline of his story before estimating its qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a nnovelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage becomes transparent in the opening chapters to all resent and to come therefore be it known that porthgenna tower with the premises adjoining is the tomb aud temple of n great family mystery captain and mrs trevertonthe former the lord of lands and monies the latter the daughter of an actress have there their local habitation  with them resides their only child rosamond mrs trevertons servant is called sarah leeson and in the first scene this woman is summoned to the deathbed of her mistress she is compelled by her domestic allegiance to write a letter to her master which the wife signs anil the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the nnovel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire nnovel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both be dont talk so dont talk so tellme quietlydear dear mother tell me quietly hush hush i am going to tell you she threatened me on her deathbed if i thwarted her she said she would come to me from the other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead secret we cannot say otherwise than that it is only a moderatelysuccessful work of fiction  thiei ilad secret thlei ads sut biv wilkie collins 2 vols bradbury and evans wxe alillldvl briefly to this new issue of the dead secret in our literary summnzar last week  btit a niore detailed criticism is called for alike by the justly eminenit positwn of the author and the sterling character of the work itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of nnovels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a nnovel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

2h little vanities of mrs whittaker by john strange winter white  co this is a pleasant enough story for the summer holidaysfairly entertaining but not engrossing easy to read and handle its martial exterior is somewhat belied by the domestic nature of the contents for its interest is centred on the doings of a typical middleclass suburban family mrs whittaker is a lady of advanced ideas who brings up her family of two girls goodlooking wholesome straight clean desirable girls as good as gold and as merry as grigs as their father calls themin the fullest modern principles of liberty at the same time she herself becomes president of the society for the regeneration of women and the artistic house in northampton park sees little of her the crisis of the story arrives when the lady whose daughters are grown up and who is verging on her halfcentury entirely changes her mode of life and enters upon a course of rejuvenation and brilliancy of apparel when she thinks she has lost hold of her husbands affection the thoroughness with which she pursues her changed ideals is in keeping with her strenuous and at bottom affectionate nature  and the characterization of the two shrewd but loyal girls and the  noble alfred a most commonplace but loving spouse is both incisive and amusing in the end the lady is justified in her full belief in alfreds nobleness but things look sufficiently black at one time to make the result distinctly a relief,novel
sister teresa new nnovels by george moore fisher unwin mb moore gave no hint if we mistake not in the first edition of  evelyn innes that he intended to write a sequel so that although there is no suggestion of it there is still a possibility that  sister teresa may be followed by a third volume to complete the tragedy of evelyn inness career the need certainly seems to arise for it for the end arrived at in sister teresa is distinctly a case of bathos it will be remembered that evelyn inns was j represented in the first book as a person in o whom sensuality and idealism were constantly struggling for the mastery and there the struggle was left undecided in sister teresa the struggle still goes on only to cease at the end not because any solution has been come to but because evelyn has been ill and she finds that she has not the physical courage to escape from the convent as she had meant to do and that she can do no more than settle down to an inert vegetable existence as a music mistress in a convent school a dead soulless existence is undoubtedly a frequent outcome of such a struggle as there was in evelyns nature but it is no solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great nnovel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a nnovel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are traces everywhere of a certain affectation of celticism mr moores recentlyfound celtic aspirations are of course notorious he has not succeeded in keeping them out of his nnovel there is a passage on p gg   he must go with her to the pure country to the woods and to the places where the invisible ones whom the druids knew etc  wandering in the woods and underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore nnovelist pure and simple we shall be content  notes on

  the right of way being the story of charley steele and another new nnovels by gilbert parker heinemann mr gilbert parker apologises to his readers for appearing to disregard a statement made in  the lane that had no turning to the effect that that tale was the last which he should write about french canada and explains that the right of way was written first so that he has only broken his promise to the eye the statement was one which many readers will regret and they will regret it the more when they have read the story which has just been published charley steele is a notable addition to fiction he is a selfcentred montreal barrister something of an enigma to his acquaintances but recognised by all for his talents and has from college days born the nickname of  beauty j steele such is the man of the earlier part of the book when having by a clever speech for the defence gained a verdict of acquittal for a murderer he marries a girl who does not love him but who is fascinated at once by his talents and his position the man of the later parts of the book is physically the same but in other ways vastly different by a perfectly plausible series of circumstancesgiven a man of his character his taste for drink and the conditions of his environmentwe find the whilom wonder of montreal in a solitary hut the companion of the very man whom he has though convinced of his guilt saved from the gallows a fractured skull destroys his memory for months and on recovering it he learns that his wife has remarried and believed to be both a swindler and a dead man he determines to become a part of the life of the village near which he regained his powers henceforward the struggle between the chaudiere tailor for such he becomes and the montreal barrister is finely imagined and consistently indicated the romance is full of exciting things and only once do we feel that the incident is forced only once does it jar on us with the feeling of cheap melodrama and that is when charley steele enters his old home during the night to recover valuables from a secret place and is disturbed by the somnambulistic wife of his earlier time once again we feel that mr parker errs in his art by a jarring note and that is in steeles dying words for the rest it is a fine story closely interesting charley steele is almost worthy to make a ternion of tailors with alton locke and evan harringtonall men of the shears but widely diverse in character and circumstance,novel
8b branetp hose or camlaer and imuwords by a ofx auwhos of lts rjectp addram 3 tls cofthis nnovel has speedily reached a second edition it has been much read and talked of it is ridiculous affectation we think to deny that the author is not an imitator of the popular nnovels from which so plentiful an harvest of fame and of something more substantial than fame has been gathered in the sly paragraphs in which the curious coincidence of the two writers treating at the same time of the same political events is roundly stated is evidence enough that mlr smith would wish to be considered as a disciple of the ad great unknown and in good truth be has been largely indeted to the la hours of his magnus apollo his redundant exemplor the whole volumes are pant with that happy imitation which is the peculiar forte of the i author of the rejected addresses to which volume so far as it rcspects the power of successful parody brambletye house forms an appropriate appendage the sources from

has been transcribed with occa sional acknowledgment manuscripts have been searched and old records rifled and with much laborious reseatch and patient industry three very entertaining volumes have been concocted we shall be quite satisfied if mr smith will pursue his career of successful paroly with the same talent and though we cannot award him the high honours of inventive genius we are quite sure that all which he does will be worth the reading and since the giant of romance has ceased to come forth in his strength we may be amused by the efforts of those who by the mechanical aid of

eccentric obtains an interview with tie king who confers on him the appointment of vice chamberlain to the queen he is now duly installed at court and the licentious profligacy that resided there is very minutely detailed on the warrant of the best historical evidence but we are tracing thie progress of the nnovel too minutely for those who love to be surprised and we fear that we way be

dutch burgomaster in whose daughter he discovered his longlost inamorata  of the lustrous black eyes we will not attempt to trace our hero through the subsequent bustling scenes in which he was doomed to act and suffer with all his passionate idolatry for an unknown being there was too much of ethereal purity in the discovered heroine to attract or fix an earthly passion in the marshes of haelbecki he finds a more congenial love in the friend of the highsouled constantia the third volume is more replete with interest than its precursors the drawsatis persona are all congreaated on english ground

heading to the chapters for onr direction we are allowed at the beginning a brief glimpse of the old squire upon wrhose legacy the main foundation of the story rests  but the real hero is his son and heir scot monk ton who is introduced to us as young and handsome and  with hair almost the colour of though old bronze velvet cushions  upon which he is wont to recline as he rehearses his favourite airs on a silver cornet there are marble steps to the door of his house picture galleries containing priceless works of art vast suites of lofty rooms luxurious meals a retinue of many servants and the usual splendour with which a lively imagination can so readily surround us the highbred calm and repose which all this wealth is supposed to engender is one day unpleasantly disturbed by the arrival of one monsieur philippe sourdet a frenchman who asks leave to be allowed to visit the picture gallery bringing a note of introduction from a cousin of the squires scots keen eye detects at a glance that this man is not a gentleman but his  innate courtesy  leads him to show sourdet all his family portraits himself and also to invite him to join the  midday meal  in the diningroom at kingswood which we are told was  a scene of luxury and pomp which caused the frenchman a feeling oddly compounded of both envy and selfgratulation  and minute after minute his manner grew more painfully obsequious while the welltrained servants wondered curiously why this strange man had not been left to lunch alone why indeed  monsieur sourdet professes to hold a family secret which he wishes to sell before revealing it for 10000z and as scot refuses with manly scorn to have any dealings with him he becomes the bete noire of the family in conjunction with a detected poacher who owes the squire a grudge the heros obstinacy is overstrained but the more commonplace characters are pleasantly drawn miss hayr succeeds much better with her wellconducted people than with her villains aunt michal for instance is often rather amusing kenneth the fevered poet and playwriter though an improbable character is interesting sometimes and well conceived whilst the little heroine 1 doris egerton is really very pleasant and natural with her flowers and her two attachments though we must protest against two sets of lovescenes with the same interchange of affectionate epithets from the same heroine to her two successive lovers there is material enough for two or three ordinary nnovels in these three volumes the first plot gives us the mystery of the frenchman and the family secret the second the story of the real heir to the estate and of his little boy willy who is on the whole very prettily described though quite an impossible child in real wic then there are some country neighbours a mr and miss chamberlain who have also a mystery which does not appear to us to have the slightest bearing upon thc rest of the story but to be thrown in by the wa as an evidence of superfluous force this is surely wanton waste for the author could easily have woven another threevolume nnovel out of this mere episode there is also a family of leveys who do not seem to have any business at all and are only in the way but whose income house dress habits and conversation are given us from time to time with unflinching perseverance throughout the book in spite however of many drawbacks there are stirring incidents well described a railway accident a storm a fire and very many more miss hay possesses remarkable fertility of invention and crowded and entangled as it is 4 the squires legacy is better worth reading than threefourths of the nnovels which we arc expected to order the tone of thc book is highminded throughout and however improbable some of the characters may be there is no  trail of the serpent over them all but an artless and genuine belief in the triumph of goodness sooner or later which is refreshing in an age of scepticism,novel
new nnovels the ambassadors by henry james methuen  co a chief aim of the art of nnovelwriting should be to conceal the fact that it is an art many of our presentday writers those above all unchastened by experience unconsciously deny this truth scorning to conceal their verbal cleverness they thrust it instead into the very nostrils of the reader confounding him with its savour mr henry james realizes it is easy to see the sinfulness of too openly rejoicing in his strength struggles against it as ardently as the most stern of religious devotees against bis physical self yet all the time with pleasant frequency through out his pages can be discovered evidences of temporary failure in the unequal struggle nevertheless the general effect is rather that of the athlete calmly conscious of his powers than of the would  be hercules anxious only to lavish what power he has upon the better displaying of it granting all this we find it hard to forgive such sentences as this  but why fondly as its so easy to imagine your clinging to it dont you put it away a query which might not unjustly be asked in clearer words of the author about the sentence itself or again  her thought fitted with a click in his endeavour to escape the obvious the author has evolved a thought which fits with an almost painfully audible click it would be ungracious however to harp too much upon these occasional spots which obscure so slightly the face of the sun like other of the authors works  the ambassadors is indubitably good work indeed as a study of life as it is lived in the world of fact rather than in the world of romance by real americans who from such places as wooilett massachusetts roam across the centuries to chester or to paris the book is altogether satisfying a sympathising hand rests as lightly upon lewis lambert strother ambassador most extraordinary as upon maria gostrey the lady whose thoughts fit rather loudly into their appropriate places or the oomtesse de vionnet giving to each its proper touch of illumination to each its due place in the scenery  fiction the ambassadors by henry james methuen 6s here is a book to appeal directly and intimately to mr jamess admirers it is indeed a book so individual so elusive so delicately wrought that only those who are as it were free of the authors dominions will pluck the heart out of it the subject has been treated before but never just in this way we have a young american in paris who is supposed to have gone down before the pleasurespell of the alluring city and to him is sent by the lads mother a man of middle age and presumably of experience to win him back to decency and america and dollars but the ambassador falls under the spell of the supposed prodigal under the spell too of the young mans exquisite surroundings and the glamour of paris and gradually he finds himself on the other side with his defection other ambassadors arrive from america but they too are thrown out of their original course by the new world which opens before them the whole thing is conceived with that delicate and ironic humour with that playful but profound insight which make mr jamess work so continually fresh and compelling he has the faculty for expressing in dialogue the instant changes and preoccupations which are of the essence of thought as it flashes between sympathetic or antagonistic minds he has too the faculty for touching though with almost a coy tenderness the deeper springs of feeling the triumph of this book consists mainly in the character of the original ambassador the man who begins and ends as a failure but who is always right in instinct and lives in a kind of abstracted fineness of atmosphere the minor characters are ahnost as good particularly two of the women the setting is admirable mr james in the earlier chapters has touched on chester with curious suggestiveness and in paris he is always at home,novel

had succeeded to praise a child for any precocious faculty or personal grace is a sure way to deprive it of its charm and men are but children of a larger growth when all has been said that can be

the rich humour of the  pickwick papers which he poured forth in happy unconsciousness before selfconfidence had been superseded by the unanimous applause of the reading world and his standard of

decays but that its movements are no longer free and unembarrassed the youthful aspirant in literature has more to fear from his friends than from his enemies his prayer should be to be delivered from the hands of favourable reviewers colonel lockhart is not now a beginner in nnovel writing so that we need not disguise the pleasure with which we have read his last production from any fear of stopping the supply he has had no inconsiderable share of praise but he has passed through the ordeal unscathed  mine is thine so far from being a falling off from his previous works is an advance upon them profiting by experience and exercise colonel lockhart has knit the parts of his story more firmly together and the qualities which made fair to see so enjoyablethe fresh exuberant humour the firm grasp of character the unaffected sympathy with romantic passion the exhilarating description of life in the open air show no signs of having lost their edge his hand has gained in cunning and none of his natural force is abated at the beginning of the third volume one almost wishes that colonel lockhart had been content to wind up the story in two volumes he begins there to raise a suspicion that the remainder of the nnovel is to be a political treatise consisting mainly of an exposition of the principles of moderate conservatism in which his hero found a career even if we had not had little sympathy with the creed expounded we imagine we should have looked upon this plunge into politics in a nnovel of which the main interest is not political as an unprofitable deviation but the dull interval does not last long after some chapters of commonplace when the reader feels inclined to throw down the book as containing no incident that he could not guess without reafding it and no reflection that he has not heard before a new subject of interest is suddenly started and curiosity is kept on the alert and the sense of hunmour agreeably titillated to the end the outline of colonel lockharts nnovel the case ot a youno ngan a sort of coningsby or lothair with a well riurked difference crossed in love for a woman framed not merely to mnake hiim happy but to foster all that

and gratifying her own consummate talents for intrigue by making a match between him and miss douglas the only child of lord germistoune a scotch peer with an income of 200001 a year in land the prosecution of this scheme forms the sideplot of the nnovel miss douglas being the heroine who by her own personal charms and not by the magic of her rentroll has captivated the heart of the hero cosmo glencairn nothing could be more humorous than colonel lockharts account of toms backward wooing and the determined wiles of his matchmaking sister whose scheme he assents to only as a temporary means of obtaining loans from her tom has no liking for marriage even as a relief from thickening embarrassments but he observes mrs ravenhalls directions to the extent of trying to look grave and serious in miss douglass presence when his sisters eye is upon him and gives her most rosecoloured accounts of his progress in the young ladys affections alike in the dialogues between tom and miss douglas and the interviews between him and his sister when she questions him as to what he said and how miss douglas looked colonel lockhart overflows with humour for example in one of toms talks with the lady to whom he is supposed to be making love but whom he amuses with sporting reminiscences and interests greatly to the detriment of his sisters scheme with anecdotes about his friend glencairn miss douglas asks whether mr glencairn is a good shot and the dialogue proceeds as follows excellent he does everything he does do well  i suppose he is always in earnest about everything he does   thats the secret perhaps it would bore me now to be in earnest about anything except of course sport and  observing his sisters sug gestive eye upon him and of course one or two other serious matters esm6 laughed  i wonder she said  what you would rank with sport as serious matters   hang it thought tom  shes laughing at me im on the wrong tack somehowbut he jerked out a sentence to the effect that  for every man there is something sacred and serious and then remembering immortal mr guppy and his refrain  there are chords had well nigh broken down  so that you have profited by mr glencairns society you are not altogether an unworthy disciple laughed esm  disciple god forbid im not a disciple at all i wouldnt go in for glencairns line of business for the world life is too short  still for every man there is something sacred and seriousyou are convinced of that  said esmb with profound gravity  oh of course i am andandall that kind of thing you know then their eyes met and they both went off into hearty fits of laughter  i have always understood thought tom that if a woman once laughs at you you may as well cry off  at once and throw up the sponge now this girl is laughing at me and small blame to her and i feel that if i were ever so much in love with her i couldnt get on the proper tack not today at least i suspect after dinner would be my only chance i believe moonlight has a wonderful effect upon the female nature and dry champagne in sufficient quantities has almost made me sentimental once or twice yes i must try it some other time under more favourable circumstances at present i cant score thats clear then seeing his sister cross the room he rose and said  i must go and sound lord germistoune about the punts and thus ended the first scene of toms little drama  lamoureux malgri lui an equally hearty explosion of laughter is the issue of the formal proposal to which tom is at last forced by his sister to commit himself we wish we had space to quote some specimens of mrs ravenhalls difficulties in managing lord germistoune the skill with which she surmounted them and the misadventures which now and then upset her best laid schemes lord germistoune is a most laughable caricature of an aggressive titled autocrat of the old school as open as a child to mrs ravenhalls flattering wiles but brooking no overt contradiction keenscented as a vulture to any attack upon his dignity and charged to the muzzle with strong language against every manifestation of the modern spirit his own account of his treatment of a remonstrance made to him by some of his farmer tenants on the sunject of game will serve as an illusration of the man  as i was saying those lowland farmers are the most confounded fellows in europe 1ll tell you what they are  theyre communiststhats what they are the last time i was at fernishallmy place in the lowlandstwo of these pirates came to me  to remonstrate as they said about the state of the game i presume you mean rabbits  i said rabbits hares and winged game too particularly woodpigeons they answered   well i said why dont you add crows magpies and sparrows and slugs and snails and everything that eats anything on a farm but what do you want   they said that their crops were being eaten and they wanted the game to be killed down to a reasonable limit i told them that the game tuas within a fair limit and not more than enough for the sport which i had a right to expect for myself and my friends on my estate which i begged to remind them was my own but our crops are being eaten they said and so they ought to be i replied  in a fair proportion game i then explained to them  is placed on a property by divine providencejust as wind blows on it sun shines on it rain and hail fall upon it by the decree of providence the crops suffer a little from all these things by the decree of providenceand by the same decree the game eats the crops in a fair proportion great heavens p i said are you going to fly in the face of providence  they declined to fall in with this view of the matter and i then remarked  when you became farmers you knew what you had to expect when you signed your leases you knew all these things and what the devil do you mean by trying to squeeze me for more than your covenant gives your we want justice they aid no i replied  you want injustioeinjustice for me  andthenigave it them hot  ill tell you what it is i said if you think im going to be harried and bothered by a lot of malcontents youre mistaken ill make you an offer it is a good deal more than justit is foolishly generous ill cancel your leases if you like and all the leases on the estate and turn it all into a gamepreserve there  i believe there is a good market for game and i daresay i should not lose much by the transaction but im indifferent to that one thing is certain i am not going to be the servant of my own tenants cost me what my freedom may  then i bowed them out and told them to send their decision to the factor colonel lockhart carries most of his personages to the castle of dunerlacht in the autumn and gives a most vivid picture of the lovemaking fortunehunting

our library ta b l e framley parsonage by anthony trol i lope chwpman and hall 193 piccadillyit is as yet by no means decided what a nnovel should be there is a growing inclination to restrict the domain of the nnovel within narrower and narrower bounds nnovels with a direct moral purpose or a historic purpose or a scientific purpose are sure to be carped at by the critics an essay they sav is the right form in which to embody these high purposes an author ought not to foist his speculations upon the public in a manner necessarily so untruthful and incomplete then tragical subjects are said to be unfit for nnovels io choose a tragical subject is instantly pronounced to be a mark of illtaste an intricate plot is decried as impossible in real life carefully elaborated characters are held up as burlesques of human nature altogether it will be found that unfavourable criticisms generally point to the fact that the nnovelwriter has aimed at too much his plot or his characters or his speculations are overdone to say that the nnovel shall represent without overstepping the modesty of nature real human life is no longer a sufficient definition we are beginning to restrict it within very much narrower bounds some weeks ago we read in a critical journal a definition of what the nnovel should be which perhaps most of our modern school of critics would accept the writer stated that the only proper subjectmatter for the nnovel was the manners of the time in which it was written with great ingenuity he proceeded to show bow invaluable such books would be to historians of later ages who would thus have documents ready to their hands from which to cull those historical flowvers which so pleasantly bestrew their heavier pages  tom jones was cited as an example of this orthodox nnovel tom jones from which book we learn that swearing was more common in those days than in these and that the lighter vices were not so strictly kept behind the veil as they now arc if we accept this definition of the nnovel viz that it shall represent solely the manxerg of the time in which it is written then  framley parsonage is a model nnovel this with the other numerous works of mr trollope will be hailed by after ages as a priceless possession from its pages the future antiquary will learn among other curious fact that the contemporaries of mr trollope were accustomed under all circumstances whether of joy or grief to dress for dinner surely mr millais when he drew that personification of crinoline representing lucy nobarts in state of woe was in au humour of grim satire there could nqt be a better emblem of the book than this picture the pretty woeful face and claspd hands and jjtj pen4ant foot though this must be bloto4 id a godw breaker fashion squeezed into odd corners to give due prominence to that mountain of flounces are as the touches of real human nature which mr trollope has sparsely scattered on the ourskirts of his huge mass of conventionalism the story turns upon the inconveniences caused by a billacceptance and the disquiets arising from a loveaffair between a rich lord and the sister of his parsonfriend the bill with all its attendant expenses does not exceed a thousand pounds mark robarts who accepts it has an income of fifteen hundred ayear moreover all his friends are rich and are eager to lend him or to give him the thousand pounds in question one does not quite see why the affair should end in bailiffs taking possession of the parsonage furniture save that the exigencies of the story demand that little piece of excitement and that a moral is thus pointed how very much more shocking it is for a clergyman to suffer such misfortune than a layman with regard to the lovepassage between lucy robarts and lord lufton the only difficulty is that lady lufton his mother is supposed to be hostile to the match lucy will not accept ludovic until the consent of his mother is gained the mother never could or did refuse ludovic anything and so when he asks her to consent to the marriage she does consent why lucy should so often enter upon the scene woebegone in crinoline does not sufficiently appear there are the usual questions of conscience in the bookthe struggaes between duty and pleasure which lie at the bottom of all human stories here these take the form of casuistries as to what a parson ought to do or ought not to do how far may he act against the wishes of his patroness ought he to visit a bachelorduke does the presence of his bishop with him in questionable society render that society innoxious to himself  mtay he ride to the meet with a friend and if so may he cross one field after the hounds and if one how many more by how much its the wickedness of having anything to do with a bill increased by the party being clerical instead of lay we know of old that mr trollope takes a great interest in the clergy he tells us some where in this story with a somewhat grandiloquent gravity that his mission towards them extends only to consideration of their social relations not of their parish or diocese business we are glad his mission is so far limited in another place he hints that he has a scheme for the equalising of ecclesiastical incomes which scheme would seem to us to be an interference with ecclesiastical business in its most sacred point however we are spaed the unfolding of his scheme in  framley parsonage and so we have only to look at mr trollopes mission according to his own proclamationa mission to satirise gently the  social relations of the clerg  spare the rod and spoil the child quoth solomon and mr trollope when after mild castigation lie relegates this child to a fools cap and the corner performs these severities ostensibly with an eye to the chiids good we have often wondered w hat lie purposes in these constant inild satires we get always now in his hooks a flourish of trumpets when he is going to trot out a pearson isle has acbievel fame for that trick and it is always printed in his bills in the largest letters mr trollope in his famous act of parsonship is received with loud applause at the threshold of the arena and probably hisses would follow if hle substitutel any other performance for that timehonoured one tlhe lady  e art of his audience especially aplreciate this poking of fun at their pastors bishop proudie turned into an old panrtaloon is meat and drink to titem the wickedness of making fun of a bi8shop gives an exquisite edge to their delight we could understand that applause of this per forinance would make mr rollope repeat it also that habit would make limn repeat itit nust be very easy to do what he has been doing for half a life but when we find limn gravely hinting a high moral purpose in these exhibitions andl referring to his labours past and to come as giving him a claim to the gratitude of his countrymen we recur with double force to our old wondermentwhat is his object  is he a special enemy or a special friend to the parsons  did a parson ever injure him or are all his relations in the church does he think the parsons the only men worth warning in this wvicked age or does he think them the only men foolish enough and defenceless enough to he lashed by satire  or is it that he has some natural sympathy or antipathy anent them  some men are strongly affected by a cat or the singing i the nose of a bagpipes any how the parsons would be well rid of him that the question of parsondom in its social as well as its other relations is a difficult one and becoming more and more difficult yearly is pretty generally acknowledged but poking gentle fun at the manners and customs of the clergyman will not hell towards a settlement of the question it has long ago been pointed out that the pet parson holds as it were an intermediate position between the sexes male and femalehe is a weaker man he is a stronger woman and it is against this emasculate condition which has been forced upon our priest hood graduallynow by rampant platitudinarianismn now by rampant attitudinarianismthat our muscularians have risen in revolt such discussions as mr rollope brings forwardhow far a clergyman is justified in putting himself in the way of contaminationwhether his virtue is pure enough to resist seduction and strong enough to repel ravishmentwhether the pharisaical attitude of gathering ones garmelits about one is not the most becoming and the safest attitude for himsuch discussions take for granted the semifeminity of the clergy and propose only to decide what precise cross between breeches and crinoline would be their most fitting garb another nnovelist is fond of touching upon this parson questiontouching upon it in its social light and in an humorous manner if mr trollope cannot get cured of his itch parsonwards he would do well to study george eliots treatment of the subject to return to the hypothesis of manners being the proper subject of the nnovel accepting this we must inquire what manners are in the sense of our definition manners are the conventional habits of society society lives in london for so many months of the year at countryteats for so many hunts in leicestershire during this season fish in norway during that shoots in scotland or travels on the continent during another society has its boxes and stalls at the opera its entrance into certain houses it consists of lords and commoners anl of some few out of the lower world who gain admittance into society by reason of their great wealth higher dignitaries of the church are in society and during the countryseat season parishparsons gain entrance on a lower footing sometimes an apothecary or a lawyer is heard of there lbut either is sure to have a ludicrous name and a burlesque manner ladiesmaids and foot men and grooms play the broadly comic parts speaking a language peculiar to themselves alone the countryseat has its attendant village and so we hear of robin postman and mrs podgerss baby the town has terrible dens upon its outskirts whither wild young men resort and so we are introduced to the tozer family society consists of a few thousand people who all agree to live much in the same way and to do the same things probably among these few thousands there is genuine tragedy and farce enough to form the basis of as heartmoving a human story as has ever been written animal hetties and mystical dinabs godfrey casses devotees of favourablechance and silas marners godstricken we have them all in those higher walks of life made by the same maker creepitig on the same earth different only in that their clothes are finer and their grammar more precise but then these deeper commotions of life never rise to the smooth surface of mlanner lovesick lucy wears innumerable flounces and the flounces are the chief business of our nnovelist we want description of the savages warpaint not speculations as to his thirst for blood to say that there are no touches of nature in framley parsonage wvould be untrue but we do say that they are almost lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming floods of conventionality lucy is pleasantly drawn and sometimes her satiric utterances against herself express as well as can be her bitterness of heart thedevotion of mrs robarts in the bailiffscene is touching the spice of poetry that exists in sowerby gains instant acknowledgment in every heart as true the pride of crawley in its first conception is excellent but then fmr trollope has chosen to burlesque it with his flippant wit there are passages in this book so truthful so pathetic so humourous that they move those who are not admirers of the author to a tenfold impatience of the mass of twaddle in which they are buried the standard which the story sets up for itself is a false one there are no men and women in  framley parsonage  they are never viewed as men and women but only with regard to their relations to society the only conscience in the book is what will the world say the only morality  such conduct does not become such a position unfrock mark robarts anrd he does not exist deprive lord lufton of his title mliss dunstable of her wealth and they cease to be no doubt the accidents of life affect inen greatly but men do exist apart from these accidents we can take hetty strip her of her lowcly circumstances and raise her to the rank of a lady and she will remain the same hetty in maggie tulliver we have the very type of a nature always at war with the circumstances encompassing it but can we imagine lucy robarts lowercd to the station of hetty  does she not disappear entirely when we take from her her educated sharpness of tongue and her conventional notions of propriety  it is because mr frollopes characters are not men and women hut effects of given circumstances only that be errs so greatly in bringing them again and again upon the stage he has not the wonderful talent to show a beatrix esmond developed into a baroness bernstein  i   we have said enough about mr trollope to show that we differ from all the world in our estimate of his nnovels he is now perhaps the most popular of our modern nnovelists his name heaven save thc mark is coupled with the toast of english literature at literary dinners is nnovelwriting the highest branch of literature  and have we no dickens or thackeray to represent it if it is rumour promises us another nnovel from his hand in the pages of the cornhill his orley farm illustrated by an artist once our first is on every drawingroom table mnr trollope is at the height of his fame we prophesy that he will live to see his nnovels rated at their worth that we should return to an admniration of the fashionable nnovel long since buried beneath worthier fictions now resuscitated in all its flimsy flippancy is not a good sign ja i  rr tile literary examiner 7 itklei i unonage by anthony trollope author of  barchester towers c c with six illustrations by t e millais ra in three volumes smith elder and co the warden and barchester towers are the only nnovels of mr trollopes better than framley parsonage it has been said that every man if he could write it has one good nnovel in bin barchester tower is a sequel to the warden and framley parsonage is an appendix to them both it is in as far as they resemble the warden that the sequel and appendix claim preeminence because they contain the particular nnovel that seems to have been according to this notion in mr trollope or that which it was in his nature to write better than another man however superior he might be in genius could have written it his sketches of clerical life are his own when writing upon other topics he is always clever lively and observant but the limits to his power are more clearly manifest mr anthony trollope is not in the highest sense a man of genius in all his works best and worst perhaps there is not a touch of original fancy as far as it is possible for a no ve 1st to be without invention he is without it there is nc ingenuity in the construction of his stories the sketches of character on which they depend for their value are the result of shrewd observation cleverly expressed in everyday phrase never of any subtle or peculiar insight into character a remark that a square forehead expresses intelligence rather than thought or that most eyes are green may be said to represent the utmost stretch of mr trollopes subtlety these are such individual opinions and notes of observation as one may hear daily from a b c and d at any dinnertable without wondering at a b c or ds profundity but they are always lively and clever in expression always therefore acceptable again in the inability to represent strong passion mr trollope shows his want of the insight that belongs to genius the passion of lucy hobarts in framley parsonage when she pours out her secret misery of a baulked love to her sisterinlaw is an example of this she speaks of herself as having been  bowled over like a ninepin when she was so sure that she  should never be missish and spoony and sen ti  mental calls herself an unutterable ass and so forth all which is of course very manly and preserves the author from all risk of being himself considered to write spoony love passages but it does not represent the passion of a woman even when she as lucy is here doing hysterically mocks at her own grief there is no want of hearty feeling in the book a healthy human sense of what he has fairly seen and entered into with full understanding in the course of life is no mean part of the strength of this as of all mr trollopes nnovels the author is no doubt too much at the usual level of society in observation and expression to admit of pathos in his writings they do not even contain any flashes of the wit with which not a few men who do not write are able to enliven social intercourse but when he is at home with his subject and it represents a cause that has his sympathy mr trollopes clear expression of a wholesome human feeling makes its wsy home to the readers heart there is force then snd there is some force everywhere in the literalness on which he depends necessarily for his power as a nnovelist the literalneeb let it be leceembered of a thoroughly quickwitted and observant man mr tieheee is et his heat we hewe laid when writs of the clergy not of the bench of bishops for his bishop is a feeble caricature but of the leaser dignitaries of the cathedral close their wives and daughters and not of these only as framley parsonage shows the picture of mark roberts the young country rector too early possessed of a good living who is tempted into the fast set of country society beguiled by an embarrassed county member and led through weakness of character to risk the very existence of a home to which he is attached j with his whole heart is excellent the domestic sulo ofhis nature is well kept in view and even when ho  known in thc county as a hunting parson we ay mario to understand together with his weakness the dornotio qualities and the religious nature underlying p the sketch of the generous impulsive wife and a nr rc el ornate study of the not less generous friend and neighbour tidy j lufton patroness of the living whose son was marks j schoolfellow and is his friend are simply fault ss the j little weaknesses and the great strength of a relined womanly nature in lady lufton thc simple and iojd j hearted prejudices the pleasant airs nf patronage always a part of the true dignity with which she is inviterthe1 generous conquests of prejudice and temper and though gentle j sacrifices that come of the love ot a widow ibr her on iv son are combined in the character of lady linton with i deli  cacy of touch that is perhaps only the more admirably true j and effective for that literalness of manner upon which we have just dwelt lord luftonher handsome and good1 natured son who falls for a short time into the hands of i the philistines and mr sowerby the embarrassed county i member whose estates are mortgaged to whom little bills are a necessity of daily life and who with unprincipled goodnature never with malice ruins himself and swindles his friends represent also thoroughly well certain forms of life the weakest parts of the book are those which affect political satire the meeting at gatherum castle  all that relates to the immensity of tom towers to the jupiter and to mr harold smith who becomes lord petty bag or to the parliamentary struggle described as a contest between the gods and giants is feeble and confused the blending of false names of party leaders with the most resent dates the triviality of the particular alludion sometimes blended with a clumsy and exaggerated general satire represent the defective side of mr trollopes literalness it may please some readers to congratulate themselves on their own cleverness in identifying with lord brougham the lord boanerges who explains the philosophy of soap bubbles to mis dunstable at that assembly at gatherum castle about which the readers curiosity was raised only to bc disappointed utterly but mr trollope makes visible no reason that he could have had in art as a writer or in politics as a satirist for an introduction of lord brougham in that place neither is the passing sketch of him in any respect clever this criticism applies to everything that may have been meant for political satire in framley parsonage the chapter on the triumph of the giants is kindred in its affectation and clumsiness to some of the classical chapter headings and to the silly opening of the penultimate chapter entitled nemesis by introducing nemesis as  peen a that just but rhadamanthine goddess  whom we moderns ordinarily call punishment or nemesis  when we wish to speak of her goddessship straight j forward and sensible as he is owing much of his popularity i to the fact that he is the cleverest of nnovelists who with j out being more subtle than most of their neighbours speak j to the world in their own way out of a shrewd head and a sound heart mr trollope still has affectation  oe conquered there is one very noticeable but necessary osequence of this wandering beyond the true bounds of hi  skill by a writer who for his knowledge of character depends j on clever and genial observation rather than on what may be called the intuition of genius ft is that the distinctest men and women side by side with the most shadowy abstractions people the same book ieverything is real at framley there is an admixture of mei  ghosts at chaldicotes and they are all ghosts at gahrrunir castle while as for the town gods and giants they aro as like anything in life as mr trollopes articles suppose to have been written in the jupiter are like anything thai eouid he written in the times but we have laid too much stress on the drawbacks to our jpraise thc real and sound part of the book predominates so largely that wc represent thc strength not of a particular passage but of framley parsonage itself as one of the best nnovels of the day when wc quote at lengthfor to do justice to a writer whose strength is not ia detached thoughts we must needs quote at length part ef the introduction to the reader of that story of the crawley family which mr trollope has written with  the best feeling and with his utmost

phases of an inferior planet fiction by ellen glasgow heinemann 6s tnis is a new york story of bohemian art life the  chief fault is that the author has so passionately concentrated herself on the two leading characters that the minor  figures are carelessly imagined and drawn without force or originality but it will be read for its extraordinary  and pitiless analysis of a very woman of the time the effect achieved is one of unrelieved misery for ourselves we say franklyand it is a tribute in a way to the writers powerthat we regret having opened it so painful was the depression it left behind the life of everyone is in large measure a struggle against pessimism and melancholy and contains sorrow enough without calling in this ill omened prophet to destroy the last germ of hope for that is the conclusion of the whole matter mariana passes through ali the deep experiences of life and finds nothing but illusion she wins such a love as might be thought to redeem any existence from despair yet it leads but to deeper sorrows motherhood yields no consolation it seemed inexplicable to her that women went on travailing and giving birth that a woman who had once known the agony of maternity should consent to bear a second a third or a fourth child struck her as ridiculous she closed her eyes and laughed the experienced nnovelreader needs no telling that a story written in this temper ends in death but how that gloomy consummation is reached we leave the explorer to discover the hero is left in despairhe is a  father but an atheist he has uncorked a bottle of poison when a knock comes to the door he replaced the stopper still holding the phial in his hand for a moment the heavy silence hung oppressively and then he answered  what is it   his voice sounded lifeless like that of one awakening from heavy sleep or a trance you are there come quickly the men at the beasley rolling mills have gone on strike a policeman was shot and several of the strikers wounded you are wanted to speak to them  to speak to them p   i have a cab you may prevent bloodshed come father algarcife returned the phial to its drawer withdrew the key from the lock and rose he opened the door and faced the messenger his words came thickly there is no time to lose he said lam ready with this message and the moral underlying it the book  abruptly ends it is not to be disputed that ellen glasgow has obtained a brilliant success if her aim was to impress the miserable doctrine that life is not worth living were such a mournful philosophy well founded its dissemination could only end in discouragement and decay but her insight is not equal to her powers of observation the best of her work is largely made up of externals and the reader cannot help feeling at the salient points in the career of her hero and heroine that there must have been in their lives much more than comes within her ken every thinker has moments of despair but none has attained real greatness who has cast the shadow of these over all life  we bid you to hope was the final message of the greatest writer of this century and one cannot help thinking that the latterday lady nnovelist would not be so gloomy and pessimistic if she would ponder the grounds on which that message was based at all events of all the  isms  in the categoryrealism and sensationalism includewe are inclined to think this  ism  of blank misery by far the most pernicious  phases of an inferior planet by ellen glasgow heinemann mariana the heroine of the story is elusive and absorbent and has many strange qualities of which endurance is not one for she parts with her husband mainly on the ground that her neighbours devour fried cabbage she has harmonious lines in spite of her irregular nose and her long chin so an artist made a poster of her upon their first acquaintance her profession was singing which she came to new york to prosecute in the curious society of the gotham house where mr paul the pessimist mr nevins the artist and others of her admirers dwell together she meets her literary lover algarcife once in love he finds many feelings revived which have been subdued so long that their expression is very difficult their married life is disastrously broken by poverty and the death of the child and mariana leaves her husband to despair which somehow ends in the agnostic becoming a ritualist priest the transition is accounted for by the necessity of working on philanthropic lines for works sake  but it is as little convincing as marianas neurotic incompetence or the late reconciliation there is merit in the story and some of the minor characters are deftly handled but it is about three times too long  phases of an inferior planet by ellen glasgow 6s ttrilnemann this is one of the exasperatingly clever exasperatingly incapable books which are produced so frequently today there is no grip of life in it and there is intellect in abundance the writer has a sense of style and she descends to bunkum she has shrewdness and she lets her characters take her in she has humour but it is of a truant fickle quality the story told baldly is rather sordid a luxuryloving girl who mistakes herself for a genius marries a very poor man of science privations make her miserable and him too for her sake so she leaves him and her art she is a singergives her opportunities for becoming very rich meanwhile her husband who is and continues to be a freethinker gives up science and becomes a highly successful ritualist priest do not ask us why it seems so natural to miss glasgow that she does not think it worth while to explain after many years the erring wife returns and says she has never loved but him with some decency he repulses her at first then succumbs to her fascinations and only her death saves his cutting his pastorship and running off with her to the sunny south the story is aimless nonsense but in the detail there is a surprising amount of ability the writer has a real power of sketching a character in a word or two as here for example wiss ramsey belonged to that numerous army of women who fulfil life as they fulfil an appointment at the dentistswith a desperate sense of duty and shaken nerves and there is an inimitable glimpse of the heroine in her frivolous moods she has aspirations towards seriousness sometimes and from her husbands bookshelves she takes mill for perusal he is much satisfied but i havent gone beyond the first page yet returned mariana     there was something in the first page about  a web of muslin and somehow it suggested to me the idea of making that bonnet odd wasnt it  and i am so glad i read it for i am sure i should never have thought of the bonnet otherwiseand it is becoming but you like mill   oh yes said mariana  i find him very suggestive i,novel
marmaduke herbert or the fatal error a nnovel founded on fact by the countess of blessington 3 vols bentley lady blessington has never written so well as in this nnovel of marmaduke herbert it is altogether her best book in thc construction as well as writing of it the interest is great and sustained by fair and honest means the narrative once begun its design is never lost sight of the attention never called away some will think that it is even too closely and exclusively pursued and the sentiment of it pushed to extremes but this is a question of art which will always arise we apprehend in connexion with thc school of romance to which the book must be said to belong marmaduke herbert is planned aud executed in the manner of godwin that is to say an elaborate investigation of feelings thoughts and motives with minute detection and analysis of the familiar workings of the heart is built upon a groundwork of romantic incident a certain degree of monotony is inseparable from a plan of this kind  but in the ready acuteness of remark the new and happy turns of reflection exhibited by the writer and the value of the lesson steadily enforced we have found thc look extremely interesting the design of it may be briefly described as an exhibition of the evil entanglements which attend concealment of the truth these are shown to be equal in bitterness to the evil consequences which i attend an act of crime in this respect and  in the autobiographical form of the narrative marmaduke herbert reminds us very much of a nnovel by lady georgiana fullerton which obtained considerable success a few years siuce but the treat ment differs in this respect that the meutal analysis is more closely carried out less distracted bv irrelevant scenes of passion and better accounted for by peculiarities of temperament and education there are minds in which the effort to be wretched with or without reason predominates over every other quality or feeling  and this in its origin development and growth is excellently portrayed hy lady blescinffton false interest is thus repelled and no claim for exaggerated sympathies on the heros behalf is faade it is wonderful how much the efeet of the story is hy this means improved and strsssftheaed what would else be too constant a proare mi hopeless misery is relieved  and thong the imp fission ml is painful it is also

concealment bring unon h  the penalties of guilt the sister of the hapless n becomes his wife  and her gentle spirit tinks und a secret silent and insufferable anguish in her hu band to which she unconsciously contribute  r which she vainly attempts to relieve this parter the tale is admirably managed and one of herbert school friends is reintroduced and reconciled to hi  in that hour of his greatest sorrow with a mot gentle effect of beauty and relief but to this other and harsher scenes succeed and he falls into th power of a vulgar ruffian to whom in the ravine jr fever enough of his secret has become known t enable the wretch to make brutal harvest of these agonies of conscience we need not describe what follows further than to say that at last herbert finds safety and relief too late for his own happine but in time to detail for the benefit of others the source of his needless and selfinflicted miseries  we are the victims of circumstances over which r frequently have no control our happiness or misery depends on some trifling chance against which no prudence no forethought can guard us and the result of which colours our fate for the remainder of our lives that is the notion with which the feeble will justify their weakness always but the higher truth is sought to be impressed by the moral of th tale that mans conduct is his good or evil angel and that no one can move through the world unattended by the shadow of what he has said and done in it  oh  the vanity the folly which leads erring mortals to believe themselves the victims of destinya belief so subversive of the courage aud principle which enable us to rcut adversity no conduct is fate and had i paused tu retied on the trials of my life i should have found that all of then had originated in some fault of my own in the extracts we give from this skilful aai well written nnovel we must prefer what can mot easily be detached to thc more striking and ekiv rate scenes the manner of the narrative is extremely well exhibited in this carefully painted picture of a child acting as chief mourner at its fathers funeral  i followed as chief mourner to the grave it seeing incomprehensible to me that the dear father who only a fewdays before i had seen in the bloom of health and mau hood walking on the very path along which his corpse was uaw borne my mother leaning fondly on his

to my feet i fancied myself nearer to manhood i saw that i was au object of attention and sympathy and when my tears for a few minute ceased to flow i conjured up fresh ones by dwelling on all the proofs of affection my lost father had been wont to lavish on meso early do we prolong natural sorrow by appealing to the imagination and memory to nurse it and so learn to become actors in the pageant of grief while tears otl down my cheeks i was conscious that i was enacting my part in the ceremony with all due propriety that tjuse around felt it and that my sables produced a striking effect nevertheless when we entered the church and when the coffin was let down into the dark and dreary vault never more to he visited by the light of day and i heard thc earth fall on it i forgot

remarkable a woman who has  roughed it as the military phrase is in a barrack ii some out of the way country quarter making the best of a position requiring no ordinary share of good humour to sustain

fact by the coun tess of blessington in 3 vols london bentley 1847 this nnovel displays a great amount of talent it is written in the most vigorous style and a powerful interest is at once c eated which is vell and ably sustained coie recommendation it possesses lies in the fact that it is distinguished from the general run of the nnovels of the present day by the absence of sentimentality it does not obtrude upon the reader descriptions of dinnerparties and ballrooms introduced in some instancts only to persuade the public that the writer has figured at them such books are very agreeable no doubt to young ladies reclining at their ease upon sofas and ready to be pleased and gratified with any fiction under the face of heaven but they are sickly food for the general reader to the young they seem new but the more experienced nnovelreader naturally seeks for something more original than a dinner flirtation a ballroom mishap or a toilette reflection the nnovel before us turns upon a fearful catastrophe the occurrence of which near the commencementof the work poisons as it was intended it should our enjoyment throughout and rouses a painful sensation which mingles strangely with whatever gratification we may receive we feel while the prospect of the greatest happiness is sketched out before us that a gloomy shadow lowers across the level plain that with the perfume of the sweetest flowers is mingled the damp unwholesome atmosphere of death that enter where we will into bower or hall the pale shadow of a murdered girl stands in the threshold pointing to her unwilling murderer and warding off perfect happiness from his path all through life the interest thus created painful as it is is still calculated to arouse intense feelings of curiosity there is a power of fascination in things of this kind our eyes involuntarily turn towards any object which pains us and therefore possesses the power of moving our souls  marmaduke herbert is therefore sure of success public curiosity once excited will be gratified the style of the narrative involuntarily reminds us of the story of caleb williams and this is because though the events are of a different character the incidents upon which the interests of the stories turn resemble each other it is not the actual crime or fault which can be said to be similar but the fact of the concealment of the fault the mere commission of the error in the present instance would not have led to the same results the con cealment of the first step instead of witdrawing the hero from his painful position naturally only flings him stilf more deeply into it one error leads to the commission of another and unhappy himself all through life he renders others equally so the domestic miseries which gradually overtake him from the days of his courtship of the sister of the poor girl of whose dath he had been the innocent cause and constitute a portion of his punishment for his unintentional crime are most ably drawn and do infinite credit to the countess of blessingtons powers of delineation the present nnovel is we think one of the best of her productions there are no lengthy digressions the story is told well and briefly so that we scarcely ever feel that a superfluous incident is introduced once in the early portion of the nnovel this occurs but it is a slight fault and we do not therefore insist more strongly upon it there are however one or two remarks which we feel ourselves called upon to make respecting the delineation of some of the characters we can allow a great deal of licence to the author who is engtiged in the task of bringing before us a woman educated in the camp brought up with officers and accustomed to their trodle of life we feel that she runs the chance of becoming mannish even coarse that some of the delicacy of her sex will be rubbed off but lady blessington has in airs scuddamore passed far beyond the mark her character is not well drawn because it is inconsistent she appears at first under very different auspices to what she does afterwards the woman in real life could not have lost sight of her feminine characteristics so wholly as she did or adopted the cool imperturbability only pardonable in a man which she manifests but even supposing this allowable it does not agree with her kind and gentle care of her niece on the first occasion when she is introduced to us nor has lady blessington at all accounted for her change of manner so abrupt and incomprehensible it seems as though the adventure had been intended to be prolonged but bad been accidentally cut short another objection we have to make is that our authoress frequently enters into details upon the subject of the dead body which would look far better in the columns of a newspaper than in the pages of a threevolume nnovel they are shocking to our taste our feelings are revolted and only at such itites do we turn with abhorrence from the pages there is an excess of brutality in the manner of the man too who brings tidings of the body which is exaggerated in the extreme besides it was unnecessary and as the messenger had no reference to the story it could only have been introduced for the sake of producing a startling effect it is intended to harrow up our feelings the more by witnessing how our heros conscience reproaches and upbraids itself during the scene in which he is compelled to behold the sufferings of his wife and mother while listening to the mans dreadful details but by a little art a better effect might have been prtduced without the introduction of the messengers speeches besides the few faults we have hinted at there is nothing at which we can have any cause for murmuring the story is powerfully told and scattered through the work are many graphic scenes and many beautiful passages as a specimen of both we extract the following  at length 1 reached the opening of the cavern i entered it and laid down the lantern which cast its faint but lurid light on the grotesque rocks around a sickening dread stole over me at the thought of the change which six months must have ef fected in the ccurse i was about to touch and i drew back with instinctive disgust and horror at the task i had to fulfil nevertheless that task must be performed however loathsome however appalling the operation might be and i moved towards the opening of the inner cavern with the intention of drawing out the body when the loud hooting of the owl so startled me that i nearly fell to the earth ashamed of iny pusillanimity i once more approached the spot knelt down and though shuddering while i did so drew forth the corpse by the feet at that moment a huge bat dew against the lantern which i had placed on a projecting rock upset it and extinguished the light for some time i felt unable to move and almost incapable of thinking my hand still clasping the icy feet at length i recovered myself sufficiently to grope in the direction in which the lantern had fallen and after a considerable time spent in searching for it i found it and struck a light with a tinder box which i had fortunately put into my pocket in fear of accident i dared not look on the face of the dead the shawl 1 had wrapped around it still enveloped it and most thankful was i that 1 was spared the horror of beholding its altered state i commenced digging a grave large drops of perspiration dropping from my forehead while vith the pickaxe i endeavoured to loosen the compact earth to enable the spade to penetrate it while i thus laboured huge bats were continually flitting around me and from time to time the screech owls sent forth their lugubrious cries i dug deep into the earth and though ready to drop with fatigue from the hard and unusual labour i desisted not until i had penetrated some five feet beneath the surface i then averting my head while i did so raised the body in my arms its extreme lightness astonished me but the cause was revealed when the shawl accidentally falling aside exposed one of the arms and hands of the deceased owing i suppose to some peculiar quality in the earth or air in which the corpse had rested it had become dried up like those of a mummy though shocked at beholding the withered discolorred limbs it was less dreadful than to see it in an advanced state of decomposition as i expected and emitting that fearful odour which marks the decay of mortality nothing of this  assailed my olfactory nerves and i was grateful to providence for being spared it i placed the matting as a lining in the grave and then descending with my lifeless burden using as much tenderness towards it as if it were still susceptible of feeling i placed it gently in its last earthly restingplace and read the burialservice over it the sound of my own voice as i pronounced the words of that sacred and touching service powerfully affected me no human accent gave the response but the birds of night shrieked dismally while i prayed i then covered the corpse with a piece of matting and commenced filling up the grave with the earth i had previously dug shrinking during the operation at the thought that the cloak and matting alone intervened between the corpse and the clay i was shnovelling over it i would have given heaps of gold had i possessed them to have had a coffin in which to place the cold remains but this was not possible and although i shuddered at every spadefull of earth i threw into the grave i nevertheless continued my painful labour until the floor of the cavern resumed its former appearance i then strewed dust over the spot and arming myself with the pickaxes spade and lantern bade a sorrowful farewell to it never shall i forget that night l an unusual stillness prevailedunbroken save by the occasional bark of some cottagers dog or the cry of some bird of night scarcely a breeze moved the leaves of the high trees whose long shadows fell like giants across the road in some parts so close as to exclude the light i hurried on through this solitude my own footsteps sounding so loud us to startle me and the beating of my own heart making itself audible sometimes a low sighing or murmuring of the heavy branches of the trees moved by an occasional gust of wind dashing down through some deep ravine from the mountains striking my ear with so sad a sound that my superstitious forebodings connected it with a supernatural warning of the danger of my mother and i would hurry more rapidly than before until breathless and exhausted i was coum pelled to rest for a few minutes those fitful gusts of the night wind followed again by a long stillness had something so inexpressibly solemn and imposing in them that they made me shudder and when some mountain torrent rutnhed down the precipitous path it had formed for itself leaping wildly from crag to crag and dashing its white foam around i felt as if it were some mysterious agent endowed with power from which i wished to escape and again i hurried on until out of hearing of its deafening noise then blaming my unmanly weakness i would turn back for a moment by the dark and funeral mountain pines and the next instant breaking into light its white masses like huge heaps of snow falling from some alpine height into the valley beneath with the sound of a mighty flood and angry with in self for even the momentary delay i would resume my rapid pace while the fresh mountain air failed to cool my fevered brow or burning lip at length the spire of the village church near my home became visible its little vane shining brightlyin the moonlight often in the days of my childhood had it guided my path home from the rambles i delighted in  and now weary and fainting i hailed it with an emotion that brought tears into my eyes i trembled violently as i approached the house i longed yet i dreaded to pass its threshold toe know my fate all my future happiness seemed to hang on the answer that awaited the question my tremulous lips refused to utter  have i still a mother a deathlike silence reigned around the garden gate was unlatched and i stealthily entered it and passing through parterres of flowers that looked snowy white beneath the beams and whose fragrance filled the air i approached the door lifted the latch hurried through the hall and into my mothers chamber there reclined on her bed the curtains drawn aside and four large waxen candles throwing their flickering light on her pallid face i beheld the dead one cry escaped my agonised breast and i fell to the ground as if bereft of life,novel
poor miss finch a nnovel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many nnovelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation nnovel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation nnovel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss nnovels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior nnovelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss nnovels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a nnovel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to nnovelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective nnovel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five nnovels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his nnovels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six nnovels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a nnovel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a nnovel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a nnovel to have been written by any one else,novel
victor and vanquished by mary cecil hay 3 vols hurst fc blackett the great feature in  victor and vanquished is the extreme mobility of lip which characterises the actors ladies and gentlemen alike are found with quivering trembling and shaking lips the moment their feelings undergo the slightest shock as the story is highly sensational and situations more or less ex ting abound these good people go through fe with many contortions of countenance here is also a great deal of crying and kissing id a general want of selfrespect among the laracters the most remarkable episode in ie tale is the death of the hero who makes ie edifying end usually allotted to the conimptive young lady this gentleman is the ghtful heir to a baronetcy who having been njustly sentenced to penal servitude the snnexion of ideas seems curiously close in dine minds is now out on a ticketofleave nd is ensconced in a cottage at high ithelston on his family estate here he is ccupied partly in saving money to pay off he sum supposed to have been lost by his orgery partly in educating the son of the eal culprit who has been deserted by his ather himself a resident in the immediate leighbourhood gerard is also endeavouring o prove his legitimacy and to oust the eigning baronet these occupations are lowever unhappily interrupted by a chance neeting between gerard and the villain relfrey when the former pitches the latter into m old mineshaft in a lake with the apparent esult of drowning him it requires no great istuteness to opine that so profligate a villain vas not born to be drowned in fact the jvhole thing has been planned by him with a riew to gerards conviction of his murder and iris own escape from a neighbourhood which was becoming embarrassing the result is a remarkable trial in which all known laws of evidence are set aside and gerard is acquitted of au act which is sworn to by three eyewitnesses in consequence of the spirited declamation of an old woman who proves that the prisoner is a very good fellow and the deceased no better than he should be we do not complain of technical inaccuracy  few nnovelists know as well as dickens that  what the soldier said isnt evidence  but we are appalled at the suggestion of long independent speeches by the different witnesses in addition to the chartered libertinism of counsel with this episode the interest reaches its climax gerard of course proves his legitimacy and soon after dies his sister marries sir neil athelston his successor in whose house she has been a governess under a feigned name and who showed her the true touch of the quality of fictitious baronets by offering to seduce her when he thought she was unprotected miss marjorie castillain to whom he was engaged at that time consoles herself with a colonel of much gravity and wisdom that gentleman no doubt has his work before him for a more unnatural sister and daughter than this hoydenish damsel it is impossible to conceive indeed with the possible exception of the colonel there is not a lady or gentleman in the book,novel
mrs falchion by gilbert parker 2 vols methuen  co in mr parkers new book the main idea of mrs falchions character as of the cold impassive woman ambitious of admiration yet giving none and undeterred even by her solitary passion from carrying out her schemes of vengeance on its object is well conceived and interesting and judged as a whole this story is a splendid study of character illumined by subtle touches of observation which reveal a no common grasp of human nature as instances of these telling sidelights into mrs falchions nature may be mentioned her touch of jealousy of belle treherne in spite of her absolute unconcern for belles lover dr marmion and the almost instinctive and absolutely reckless physical bravery which she displays on several occasions in a word mrs falchion lives and is no mere conglomeration of qualities huddled into a fictitious unity and the same may be said of the other chief characters for all this and it is much mr parker deserves sincere gratitude nevertheless or rather on this account it is difficult to repress a feeling of disappointment with the book which may appear somewhat ungracious but the fact is that it is in some respects so good that it is a pity that it is not better for one thing the story does not make a satisfactory whole it seems almost to come to a dead stop in the middle of the first volume with the apparent death of the husband and it is some little time before one can realise that the story is subsequently to hinge on galt roscoe who has not appeared before again the husbands return at the end followed by mrs falchions reconciliation to him besides being terribly commonplace is a mistake dramatically as he has by that time quite passed out of the story there is another point which may be less dwelled on but it too seems a structural error the importation of a real motive for vengeance on galt roscoe as some justification for mrs falchion the whole business is left rather obscure and it confuses the issues which would be more effective if mrs falchion had no cause for persecuting roscoe except sprette in j uria forumefor the rest the conversations in the book are well written and clever though there is occasionally a tendency to make them too long and discursive one error of style may be pointed out which would not have been expected from a writer of mr parkers power he has the habit of constantly interposing remarks like  but if i had known the events which were to occur within the next month such statements are an unworthy device for attracting attention and indeed are not required thanks to the interest of mr parkers narrative in spite of all faults this book is one of remarkable power and still more remarkable promise for its shortcomings are more accidental than essential,novel

the great god success by john grahamn 4 i leineinann we confess we began this story with some misgivings lest it should be another bitter plaint of one who had missed the prizes of the world and now railed at the more fortunate such plaints have often much justice in them but are none the less regrettable since they attack the great god success in an ineffectual fashion to flout the deity by showing in a cheerful spirit all that was gained by his neglect is not only more wholesome but more efficacious but ere we had read fifty pages we had to apologise to mr graham for our loubts and at the end we acknowledged that in a most vigorous and original manner he has hurled defiance at the god the story is that of a young american journalist who begins in a humble position in new york and arrives at the top of the tree by dint of undoubted talent a rare fund of nervous energy and steady industry a careless reader will certainly be beguiled into thinking he is reading the story of a strong man and into admiration for that wonderful machine the modern press as it is seen in all its perfection of complexity in new york mr graham has described it with wonderful exactness with even wonderful fairness he has reached his climax has proved his thesis by a slow subtle method which we do not hesitate to describe as materly howard wins the prizes all along the line and among them is his wife the beautiful and cultivated mnarian whose portrait is drawn in the finest of lines and it is all dust and ashesthough few guess it and he would cling to all he has gained for mr graham has clearly proved that energy and concentration and industry and brains do not make a strong man howard was essentially weak he did not dare to be unsuccessful on the second page very unobtrusively the key to his character is given but to most of us the careful detailed moderate record and interpretation o his career in these pages are not superfluous we congratulate mr graham on an unusually vigorous and dignified study of modern life and character  the great god success by john graham heinemann this latest addition to  the dollar library is another narrative of the strenuous fight in new york for wealth and power and its moral is precisely that of mr barrs book but the work is done with a fine fretsaw instead of a slashing axe it is a lesser but more comely and compact edifice than  the victors lees striking but better built the hero of this story is even more eminently a  victor  than those dealt with in mr barrs book  and his triumph is more emphatically a thing of bitterness and emptinessdead sea fruit in his mouth at the end a beautiful wife great wealth a position of exceptional power and the ambassadorship to the court of st jamess he won them all and woke to learn that he had lost his own soul,novel

him that cheapest of all gifts good advice but the best scenes are all too long and too entangled to bear separation from the story as a whole it reminds us not a little ofthe younger iodwins faulty but powerful nnovel transfusion  vandelcnr or animal magnetism 3 vols we think extremely well of this work and recommend it strongly to all those who delight in skilfullywrought fiction the heroine gertrude is the only daughter of an english gentleman of great property  she is betrothed to a fine manly character a major vandeleur and everything seems propitious to the match miss livelyn gertrude has an only brother on whom is centred all her ailed ions almost even to the exclusion of other feelings the brother is thrown from his horse and in consequence of the fall becomes fatuous this stops the approaching marriage and on this accident hangs all the interest of the piece and gives the opportunity of the villain of the nnovel a count despoir to bring his machinations into plav even in his boyhood he has been thwarted in his plans of wickedness by the hero vandeleur after a long and anxious attendance upon her bereaved brother gertrudes health failing she is compelled by her father and her relations to repair to paris for change of air and scene the count meets her hears her story and impelled both by hate and love determines to make her his own the agent that he employs is  animal magnetism there are some well gouup scenes in this part of the story which work conviction upon the heroine in consequence she relies implicitly upon the count for the recovery of her brother in the meantime her betrothed vandeleur i by her banished for a certain number of months to ireland and it is understood that at the expiration of this expatriation whether her brother recover or not she is to make him happy by marriage the count under various very plausible pretences insists that all his operations for the recovery of her brother shall be kept a profound secret  thus he establishes with her a clandestine intercourse they both come to england and a very few days after their arrival the unhappy youth with many subterfuges of the heroine is wheeled out by her alone into the garden and thence into a deserted arbour where the counts meets her and the mummery begins the poor boy dies under it whilst thc desolate sister is moaning over the beloved body that she believes she has been instrumental in murdering for the wily count made her the magtietiser the father and the lover burst in the count shoots the lover and scares oil the father with his other pistol and the lady now amidst all this misery unconscious of her acts fiings herself into the anns of the rascal who expecting some denouement of this description bears her away to a carriageandfour the father believing with her consent all this is very powerfully told the lover being reduced lo the verge of the grave is unable to trace out the ravisher but he is firm in his belief of the innocence of gertrude she undergoes in the power of thc count unparalleled persecutions which are really harrowing to read and at length consents to marry him they go to america for some time and thence to moscow in the meantime her father dies and her lover wanders the earth in search of her for her cousin the next male heir wishing for the property accuses her of the murder of her brother and reclamations from the homeoffice in england are sent to all the foreign courts that she and her husband may be delivered to the english authorities for trial vandeleur has just so much the start of thc official messengers as to warn her of her danger he does it rather inexpertly and the count again shoots him but not with so terrible an effect as before gertrudes amidst all these horrors flies to the protection of the english ambassadress  and she being formerly attached to vandaleur gives it and gets her placed under the protection of the empress of all thc russias from this point the story ought to have been wound up rapidly but unfortunately three volumes were required ami so the emperor alexander falls in love with her and the empress grows jealous and all that sort of thing and then there is a long seclusion in the remotest parts of switzerland and a still longer departure from the rules of common sense in her treatment of her lover however after all the count is polite enough to die and a letter is found which proves that gertrude did not kill her brother and so at a very discreet age the two lovers marry and are made happy the greater part of the last volume is evidently a maketriical consequently it is heavy enough all the other parts of the work are delightful and as the working out of this story requires many minor actors we assure the reader that their characters are well and graphically drawn we have been already longer in our remarks on this story than we intended we conclude by saying that it is really an acquisition to our imaginative literature and that it deserves every success,novel

  an open verdict an opm verdict by the author of  lady audleys secret london john maxwell and co miss braddon has written long and written much but her imngination shows no symptoms of exhaustion and her style gives no sign of staleness if any failure of power is to be discerned in this her latest work it is of a kind not wholly to be deplored for while  henry dunbar  and  only a clod wtith other books of what we may call miss braddons  storm and stress  period suggest a wide and accurate acquaintance with the  newgate calendar  an open verdict in spite of its professional title contains no graver crime than larceny and no actual breach of anv other article of the mosaic code than the fraudulent abstraction of a document involves perhaps many of miss braddons readers may regret this circumstance and look back with lingering fondness to the days when  undiscovered crimes and recollections of a detective were thrown entirely into the shade by the less chastened vigour of her invention for ourselves we must confess that we have some sympathy wtith this feeling such scenes as that in which the servant murderer and impersonator of mr dunbar is discovered by the waiter of the hotel vainly trying to open his despatchbox with the wrong key do not easily fade from the minds of those to whom fiction is as it ought to be a stern reality but considerations are quite outweighed by the satisfaction with which we regard a skilful and practised writer escaping from the groove of sensational incidents and the meshes of criminal intrigue to the fresher and more wholesome atmosphere of everyday life for when all is said it must be admitted that anyone can compile a more or less exciting series of lawless exploits though few could impart to the performance the same interest and fascination as miss braddon whereas it is a far more difficult and a far more profitable task to construct a readable story without transgressing the limits within which the stream of ordinary existence is restrained  an open verdict introduces us to the commonplace society of a yorkshire village in the immediate neighbourhood of a manufacturing town whereof though vicar is an indolent epicurean scholar reminding us strongly of a similar functionary in mrs oliphants tale  a rose in june mr dulcimer how ever gets on better with his wife and has generally more of the milk of human kindness in his composition than his prototype his conversational powers are by no means small and his rejoinder to mrs dulcimer when she reproaches him with a disproportionate estimation of  temporal blessings strikes ns as rather happy they are the only blessings we can fully realise while on this side of eternity my dear we may be excused if we sometimes set an undue value on them mrs dulcimer is a lady with a passion for making matches and is in many respects the leading character for she succeeds by the masterly indiscreetness of her manoeuvres in materially spoiling the happiness of at least five lives no part of miss braddons book is to our thinking more impressive or successful than the wide and fatal results which the amiable efforts of a goodnatured busybody produce on the people with whom she is brought into contact next to the vicar the most noticeable person in little yafford is a melodramatic person called christian harefield who lives in strict retirement with his only daughter brooding over the memory of his wife whom he brutally illtreated as long as she was within his reach this gentleman is represented as a type of the haughty aristocrat but of his manners two specimens shall suffice he appends to a letter on business addressed to his solicitor the following possjript oblige me by sending the quietest of your girls to play with my daughter every afternoon at three and to the same gentleman he also writes  dear scratchellmy daughter is ill and wants pleasant company please let your girl come and stay with her if there is any loss involved in your daughter being away from home i shall be happy to send you a choque for whatever amount you may consider sufficient yours truly c ii the said daughter isabella scratchell will be familiar to all miss braddons readers innocent in appearance mild in manner she conceals a ferocious disposition behind a beaming exterior and so forth in point of fact she is as detestable a little minx as one would wtish to meet and does great credit to her creators unimpaired powers she is the conscious as mrs dulcimer is the unconscious maker of mischief in the book and without saying anything of her ultimate fate we feel that she is rightly served in being compelled by parental and pecuniary pressure to marry a coarse old widower who introduces his courtship by remarking that   mrs pipers death left a vide here mr piper touched his waistcoat to indicate that the vacuum was in his heart mr piper also called his sons by the names cobbett bentham horn tooke and brougham while his daughters were christened elizabeth fry and mary wolstencroft mr piper was another inhabitant of little yafford as was also the rev cyril culverhouse a fervid high churchman andor should we say but   the lover of beatrix harefield mr culverhouse was not in our opinion a nice young man it is true that he wtas an earnest i priest and that he was successful in converting the  shallowest specimen of the  shallow infidel  ever presented to the gaze of the orthodox but when the gloomy christian harefield whose gloom was perhaps increased by a habit of reading the westminster lleview died with every symptom of poisoning by opium the virtuous cyril immediately suspected beatrix of being a murderess on thc cogent and convincing evidence that she had been taking laudanum as a cure for sleeplessness whereupon having already proposed and been accepted he deserts her of course the holy man  loved her none the less because he kept aloof from her of course the fact that she had once asked in a fit of illtemper whether it was wicked to wish for her fathers death implied to the clerical mind that  she had already committed the sin nevertheless we think many people will agree with mr culverhouses cousin in thinking that he behaved like a  mean hound the said cousin sir kenrick culverhouse not unnaturally takes advantage of cyrils cowardice for beatrix has ten thousand ayear and sir kenricks estate is encumbered for a british officer he was by no means deficient in natural eloquence  let the beginning of a brighter and happier life date from today you are one of those flowers of earth which seem to be born to blush unseen you who aro so worthy of love and admiration have lived hidden from those who could admire and appreciate but if a real and unmeasured love in the present can compensate for your losses in the past that love is yours beatrix but we are sorry to say that in spite of these fine sentiments sir kenrick commits the unpardonable sin j of revealing a ladys secret and adds if possible to his guilt by making the revelation to another lady and that lady mrs dulcimer we are afraid that there is more than one u mean hound  in miss braddons story we think we have sufficiently indicated the lines of miss braddons narrative which is exceedingly well written and keeps up its interest from the first page to the last we have indeed omitted to mention that there is an affair of the heart to which ono of the parties is a married woman for that goes without saying in the case of miss braddon as does its invariably innocent termination so practised a writer should have avoided such a solecism as  standing at gaze and political controversy cannot excuse such an odious vulgarism as  vulgarian miss braddons book like those of emmanuel joyce her converted cobbler contains a richness of illustration that las a charm even for the unlearned an urn cannot be brought in for breakfast without being  dimly suggestive of sisterly affection in the person of electra  wisdom as mature as bacons or pascals  sounds well but unfortunately pascal never reached maturity nor do we think it true that mr carlyle is a writer demanding a considerable expenditure of brain power on the part of his readers these are paltry blemishes but in so excellent a nnovel it is necessary to criticise minutely if we criticise at all on one point of more importance we should like to say a fiual word to miss braddon she is one of the few writers whose position is sufficiently secured to enable her to deviate with impuuity from established customs and she must be aware without our telling her that  an open verdict might just as easily have been written in two volumes as in three signs of deliberate padding are by no means wanting and though it is wrell done it had better not have been done at all life is short and art is longvery long the threevolume system is a survival of the unfittest miss braddon will say they are persian attire but let them be changed,novel

voh smith aad bider gores lively hand is yet far from having lost its cunning it is much the best nnovel we have had from her of late years but the interest which holds its scenes together is somewhat of the flimsiest and there is never that welldefined purpose and but seldom the masterly detection of worldly motive which in mrs gores earlier works gave so much solidity as well as point to her sketches of society these latter however are still characteristic as of old though we have to put up with  greatestliappinessofthe gveatestnumber people and such like commonplaces instead of our old favourites the  killyourownmuttonsoil of people the drift of the book as far as we can see is to show the moralising or demoralising effects of english society and fashionable life according to the temper and disposition over which they exercise an influence but the contrast of the sisters is a little overdone the flavour is too high in the one case and in the other perhaps somewhat too low we find the happiest parts of the nnovel away from both old  squire pro  is a capital sketch and the progress of his clever son to eminence through all the obstructions that beset the aspiring commoner in england has more of mrs gore 8 better spirit than anything else in the book the mere writing is always pointed and clever and though few of the scenes have not been similarly dwelled upon in former nnovels we may not call the book tedious indeed it is a readable and interesting nnovel the opening chapters are particularly good and various the picture of sir george downham between the family of his first wife who despise him and his choice of a second wife whom he shall himself be entitled to despise is an excellent piege of satire and the death of the wife is a beautiful and affecting piece of writing there is also plenty of mirth to stand hi place of a better story in the amusing hits at the stokesleigbs the hartingharas lumleys and tom noddys in the quiet laughter at female pretenders from sanctimonious duchesses to mrs euphrasia primwells and in whimsical descriptions of high life from  the little crowing thing in the nursery entitled to a coronet on its papboat to the condescending great lady in the country dance  trying to look joyous aud great british while undergoing the familiarities of hands across in short there is plenty to amuse the nnovel reader in mrs gores diamond and pearl though less than used formerly to be found in her works to satisfy readers more difficult to amuse  the diamond and the pearl by mrs gore 3 vols colburn for a person who would be described by the majority as principally skilled in sarcastic sallies and those expositions of savoirvivre which imply keeping pace with our breathless times mrs gore possesses a store of fancy and imagination richer than ordinary an occupation more genial than the incessant keeping record of mayfair frivolities might have given her an honourable name among poetesses this we think may be gathered from her perpetual resort to trope and symbolfrom the garniture with which she can clothe some flimsy bit of worldly wisdomfrom her perpetual and we apprehend almost involuntary recurrence to the phraseology of scripture had this nnovel owned any other parentage its title might have led us to expect a narration of the notable murders done by a necklace or the eavesdroppings of an earring but we knew that mrs gore was about to treat us to a brilliant woman contrasted with one of tenderlydelicate nature and thus accordingly it comes to pass yet our authoress does not fulfil the promise of her title as she might have done her diamond is neither pitt nor pujotno veritable  mountain of light but a patchedup thing put together by some chemical jeweller with his blowpipe ns was the sevigne proffered by miss edgeworths lady hcarcroft to lady davenant some we suspect will object to grant it as much praise as this  or to allow that there is one scrap of  pure carbon in its composition calling the glittering toy at once a bad name  a counterfeita piece of palaisroyal paste we know of old that mrs gore shines in the delineation of hard worldly women why then could not she vary her figure for once making her helen as brilliant ns she pleased in wit beauty and ambitionperilled by this very brilliancybut still genuine andnotasnow thepoorhack of fashion all efforts and

place behold a mayfair lioness far better does blanche the pearl keep the promise of her name as sister daughter wife she is  a veritable margaret foiling the false brilliant with her purity and exquisite delicacy of colour yet even here mrs gore has not been able to rise superior to old conventions if  to be pearl is best what need was there of giving to the innocence beauty and holy wisdom of her heroine the sanction of fashion i well is mrs gore aware not only that a real mrs john watts could never have become the rage with the suddenness here described but what is more that she would not society is a strange complex thing and the step from absolute retirement to the observation of all observers may be taken by a una without peril but cannot without pain  still less per saltnm we had hoped after mrs gores rest from production that she would have given us something more natural and less nnovell than this tale of surprises conversions reformations vide sir george downham and judgments as set j forth in the fate of the llartingham title she j is always smart and amusingbut will she never more be probable  after what has been said no person of any moderation will expect a more precise account of how the diamond sparkled and through what amount of vicissitudes the pearl kept its purity some of the sketches of character in this nnovel are lively the picture of the household of the peerbishop is as graphic in ita grimness and its primness as most that we have looked upon other hits seem almost personal from the unnecessary and ineffective sharpness with which they are launched as usual mrs gore ranges herself on the side of the movement yet as too frequently happens it would seem as if she could not satisfactorily get to an endloflur task without

or men from monkeys our poor heads too are like to be  fitchfatch c by the confused nature of this narrative and by the extraordinary medium through which the author chooses to convey his ideas mr tirebuck has already proved his powers of observation and his mastery of though lancashire dialect but he should beware of too incessantly striving to avoid simplicity he does not always strengthen his style by straining after the epigrammatic the results are often painful to read and he comes perilously near the bad eminence of a torturer of his mother tongue sometimes  nay often  there is an idea underlying his mannerisms the eyes of owen mowcroft the lymphatic musician who goes near to spoiling megs life were blue blue eyes which at their happiest and best were like two faroff sounds of ethereal serenity that had been transformed into the silent azure of personal fancies affections and dreams that is a happy fancy and many such diversify these pages but  meg smartly smacked his laugh

detail because the multiplication of these hard sayings makes the book in many places painful to read and it deserves to be read we cannot quite appreciate the extent to which meg is affected by the bodily blemish the scarlet birthmark or the wild blood of which it seems an emblem her rather aimless vacillations deprive her of the first place of interest yet her adventures the sojourn among the

unreal and grotesque but ark and his equally unselfish friend hollie pondie motherly mrs dootson and a host of minor rustic characters testify to a good deal of humorous and tragic power in this

fiction the passionate friends by h g wells mac i millan and co 6s m r wells continues to give us nnovels which m have everything to make them great save the not unimportant exception of their writing it is a distinct loss to art which we begin to fear will never be remedied a clear case for collaboration or at the least for the employment of a competent subeditor with an ear for the harmonies of our language in this story he has reached a very high point of interest for the men and women of today in the opening pages he expresses thoughts which have occurred to many of us at the deathbed of a parent the cold serenity of those who have finished with this life bears in upon us with poignancy the whole sum of experienceof love of sufferingthat is lost to us for ever the bitterness of our grief at the thought that the years of comradeship between fathers and sons mothers and daughters have left so little knowledge of their inner life the influence of a noble life well lived fruitful as it may be is difficult of definition and only the actual work done by anyone remains after them to testify to their spiritual life mayhap in the future a closer intimacy between the passing and the coming generations may be of help to the latter when face to face with the crises of manhood and womanhood and it may become possible to utilise the experience our elders won with so much agony of heart and mind and avoid the waste of sensation in this passing pilgrimage all we know of life religion may indeed help us to bear our troubles and give us courage but it lacks the definite signposts that the protecting care and experience of parents might provide what acute consciousness has any of us of the childhood of our parents and have we not taken it for granted that they were beings set apart from the daily toil and pleasure of the worldsuperior beings it may be but in spite of all their love and care a little aloof  stratton whose life has nearly been wrecked by a loye affair wishes his son to benefit by his experiences and therefore tells the story of his passionate friendship in the series of letters of which the book consists we wonder if the author realises exactly how searching and how true is his analysis of the heart and mind of an intelligent modern woman as portrayed in the person of lady mary christianone essentially fit to be a mans comrade and support in his battle with life eager to be an inspiration to him in his work but not a wife for an ordinary man with little sense of citizenship who seeks in her only the mother of his babes some impatience is aroused in the reader when mary instead of marrying strattonthere had been a boy and girl love episode between themdecides to marry justin a wealthy financier but the youth of the girl had been passed in easy circumstances and so without experience and thirsting for the power to do things she chose what seemed to her the simplest waya way it must be added that all the combined influence of her family urged her to adopt stratton desperate at the frustration of his hopes goes out to the south african war five years later the two meet again and marys old interest in strattons future and the work he is to do in the world rekindles till without warning their friendship bursts into flame and all their good resolutions are scattered by the imperious demands of their love the man is prepared to go out into the wilderness with his mate but not so the woman and a peace is patched up with justin who has suddenly discovered the true state of affairs unfortunately justin has nothing to offer an intelligent woman except luxury an intensified material life and a beautiful home a cage for a woman like mary the very opposite of the spiritual development she craves we are not here concerned to pass judgement upon mary and stratton our business is to understand and see whether hasring accepted the authors situations he provides us with any solution stratton goes away and eventually marries a nice girl who has been in love with him for some time after several years he receives a letter the first of many from mary who in her desperate mental loneliness wishes to keep in touch with his work fate in the shape of a chance short meeting in switzerland deals them a final blow justin hears of it and will listen to no explanation in spite of the fact that their love had been purified of all that was selfish and earthly for long spaces we did not talk at all nor feel the need of talking and what seems strange to me now seeing that we had been impassioned lovers we never kissed we never kissed at all i do not ever remember that i thought of kissing her we had a shyness between us that kept us a little apart and i cannot remember that we ever touched one another except that for a time she took me and led me by the hand towards a little place of starry flowers that had drawn her eyes and which she wished me to see already for us two our bodies were dead and gone proceedings for divorce are instituted and to save strattons work to prevent the ruin of his home mary commits suicide their last pathetic interview when she has already decided unknown to him on her death is a masterpiece of sympathy in the final scene between stratton and justin mr wells conveys his message  stratton he said we twowe killed her we tore her to pieces between us    i made no answer to this outbreak we tore her to pieces he repeated its so damned silly one gets angrylike an animal i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you we never planned to meet and when we metif we had been brother and sisterindeed there was nothing i suppose he said i ought to be glad of that but now it doesnt seem to matter very much we killed her   what does that matter to me now  fiotion i the passionate friends by h g wells macmillan  co during the last few years mr wvells has been gradually coming to be counted among the few nnovelists of importance of our day now that we have abandoned the expectation of another wessex story from mr hardy a reader of literary taste can hope for satisfactory writing from only a restricted circle of these mr joseph conrad is among the first he is immensely influenced by dickens and markedly in style by henry james but he is what dickens never grew to be preeminently an artist in words and situations mr maurice hewlett and mr robert hichens are two more of the artists of today and the former preserves a touch of romance in his wider choice of subject and character which mr hichens has to seek and often not to find in the neurotic excitement of an unhealthy social circle of mr henry james himself we need not speak both as belonging to an older generation and as having evolved a style of his own which is now as far beyond criticism as carlyles or merediths into this circle mr wells has forced his way by sheer weight of subjectmatter in a series of remarkable nnovels tonobungay  anne veronica the new machiavelli  marriage and  the passionate friends he has dealt with various aspects of a problem which threatens modem society with dissolution unless some answer can be propounded to itthe condition of woman mr wells has had no cause to repeat the complaint familiar a quarter of a century ago that english writers of fiction find it impossible to deal with fully one half of the subject of their art to use oldfashioned language four of his heroes out of the five are adulterers while his description in one or two of the nnovels of the minor manifestations of sexual attraction though well observed would seem even to the majority of french writers of fiction unpleasantly realistic but the transparent sincerity of mr wells and the weight of his thought carry him triumphantly past censure on these accounts his serious fault howeverone which will weigh more and more against him as years go onis that he has never cared to learn how to write in his recent nnovels there are deformities which an adequate revision would have eliminated strings of adjectives smother their noun   massive ancient and traditional common way of living  vast enduring normal human existence illiterate agricultural unprogressive and simple unlettered laborious and essentially unchanging are examples from a single page of this nnovelmuch as in the modern drawing four or five approximate strokes of the pencil replace the firm line of the great masters we do not insist in english on that inexorable rule of french prose which admits only of a single adjective to each nounthe double adjective is often not only useful but also beautiful but such phrases as those cited above seem to us examples of mental sloth the absence of rhythm and balance in mr wellss sentences is a still greater fault the first test of good prose is that it should be capable of being read aloud and such a phrase as  and also to all those other  could not have been passed over by any writer with a fine ear the number of mixed metaphors in the book too is eloquent of nonrevision mr wells the social rebel and reformer mr wells the storyteller are with us in their prime but mr wells the artist has not developed to some perhaps to him with the weight of his message upon him this may seem a small thing dont it state the facts and dont it rhyme in places  was the remonstrance made by a disappointed author to a western editor who had rejected his poem on literary grounds but mr wells when lie is describing the aspects of modern life which move him is not only writing for today he isto use the thought of his own striking introduction to this book  writing also for posterity our descendants will come when they are seeking a knowledge of our times not to the  anna matildas  of today but to the great books written with serious purpose and it behoves mr wells when lie anatomizes the confused society in which we live to give of the best that is in him with this exception there seems no reason why we may not expect from him in the near future very great fiction he has produced short stories of admirable quality his scientific romances exhibit a fertile imagination well under control and his more serious nnovels show close observation of the tragedy which the inner life of any intellectual personman or womanmust present in the story before us this inner tragedy is the prelude to an outer one the last sacrifice of passionate friendship to love the story is written down by a father for his son when lie grows up a common form to which mr wells adds a personal touch by his recognition of the appalling uselessness of our personal experience to any one but ourselves it is the history of the love of stephen stratton for lady mary christian of her love for him of their separation and meeting again and once again and of her suicide under an unfounded charge to save his work in the world we have no hesitation in saying that the character of mary is the finest and most complex that mr wells has ever created she is a free woman loving and loved but resolved to remain free to this end she marries a wealthy manjustinto whom she is to be merely a part of his collection of precious things resolved as she is to be neither a young mans slave nor an old mans darling five years later stephen and she meet again and their buried love bursts into flame it is of course discovered but peace is patched up upon terms lady mary becomes the mother of justins children and stratton marries in the middle of his campaign of social politics again after an interval of years mary feeling the need of her old friends confidence begins a correspondence and her letters as presented by mr wells are perhaps the most subtle bits of psychology he has ever achieve d theyreveal in a convincing light the inner attitude of the  pretty silken furry feathery jewelled 8ilence8 who are the women of today they hint at the vengeance which is falling upon society for taking away from serious women their proper share in the duties of the greater world and exaggerating the disabilities of sex like harold frederick in a wellknown nnovel written many years ago mr wells insists that a system founded on the subjection of women is doomed to perish and that until some way of rational freedom is opened out to them society cannot be stable by chance the friends meet again for a few hours the passionate jealousy of justin bursts out and mary dies by her own hand after a last pathetically futile meeting with stratton apart from the fundamental problem of the book the present trend of mr wellss mind is indicated by the career of his hero the glorification of machinery as against that typical creation of the last century the unskilled labourerone of its byproducts the cult of constructiveness and synthesis the insistence on the importance of india and china as factors of the civilization of the coming years his changing way of looking at labour problems all this is suggestive of thought no matter what the readers economical or political standpoint may be agree or disagree as we may we recognise the intensity of the authors interest in what lie has to say and as we lay down the book our thoughts turn once more to the sweet and noble figure of his heroine unconscious martyr to a cause which has yet to come to the front of life before complete civilization is reachedthe making possible of friendship between man and woman lamiti6 impossible  n i  the passionate friends by h g wells macmillan 6s once more in the autobiographic manner introduced in tonobungay mr wells gives us in the passionate friends a nnovel which is partly sociological essay partly a notebook of selfrevelation partly a philosophical homily wrapped up in fiction and in that stirring language more chastened perhaps than usual that invariably invests this authors work with such astonishing vitality and interest mr wells has to all appearances broken free from the academic socialism of his early life and now apparently feels himself alone in the world strong enough and confident enough to break down or construct at his own sweet will and pleasure he writes now as a mature sage looking out upon life from the pulpit of his own library in this nnovel he once more deals with the problem of marriage and though what he says and the manner of saying it is invariably interesting full of ideas and strong it can hardly be said that mr wells has added much to the question or indeed struck any vibrating note of truth such as one finds say in the pages of an autobiographic writer like strindberg always one feels that mr wells is not saying what he would really like to say of course the conditions of our literary market are preposterous and a writer is more or less the slave of them one lives in hope and somehow one feels that mr wells is all the time toying with his subject and never really taking out his literary knife to flense the weaknesses sores and evils that he evidently descries in our social life one has the feeling that mr wells is too often consciously subscribing to convention and not really facing the music as a stern thinker and sociologist however this is a nnovel and not science a work to entertain us rather than to instruct everything that mr wells writes is interesting indeed he is perhaps the most allround arresting nnovelist that we have in this country in the passionate friends one finds very illuminating very delightful very eager very tender passages he is especially good on boyhood and the first pages of this book are wholly delightful as composition even if the incurable literary grumbler finds reason to cavil at the nnovelistic optimism which characterises every page with its inevitable avoidance of things that are not cheerful or what mr shaw would call pleasant there is a little too much of the daily telegraph tone about this book none the less it is a real book if it does not approach the greatness of the new machiavelli it is certainly a book to be read and considered,novel
a name to conjure with by john strange winter white  co we have always been outspoken in dealing with mrs stannards books and in many of her earlier works we called atteution to some very pronounced defects we are bound to say however that of late a marked improvement has taken place one cause of this advance is that mrs stannard in the present work has rigidly excluded everything connected with soldiers she has won a sort of notoriety as the writer of pseudomilitary nnovels but that notoriety hardly seems justified to those who know the army for she has thown strange ignorance of army matters and produced many caricatures of military life in the present nnovel she deals with the world of literature a subject in which she is more at home and we are spared both the lisping foolish dragoon and the silly lordliug the motif is the danger to female brainworkers of indulging in stimulants and the idea is not badly worked out indeed we consider this one of the best books produced so far by mrs stannard though some of her diction is more bohemian than the exigences of the story require  a nami to conjure wits by jorin strange winter the author of bootles baby here deserts soldiers for the literary life her heroine is mary lesaingham the daughter of a suddenlyimpoverished millionaire and wife of a journalist being put to it for means of subsistence she took to nnovelwriting and became an idol of the hour her first book was called  day dawn and her first publisher winklemann the tragedy of the story is that in order to sustain herself in an artificial life of literature and society the heroine takes to stimulants and is enslaved by them white 6s  a name to cotnjure with by john strange winter f v white  co 6s  our acquaintance with the work of mrs stannard is by no means complete but we think we are correct in saying that a name to conjure with marks a departure in her productions there is throughout the story plain evidence of an intention to be truthful and to abandon the prettiness of sentimentality further the book is strongly imagined and it is just this imaginative strengthrarest of all qualities in fiction and every other artwhich with its sincerity atones in a large measure for the nnovels numerous shortcomings the writing is careless and vulgar and the special pity of this is that mrs stannard has a natural gift for good unaffected vigorous english the theme is trite and has been treated over and over again the characters are literary people our experience of literary nnovels almost moves us to lay down a rule that authors and journalists should never figure in fiction mrs stannards heroine is a lady who from writing tales for servants and shopgirls springs suddenly into fame as the author of a really great nnovel mrs lessingham the name to conjure with  and her husband have hitherto been poor their income is now multiplied but they spend proportionately and mr lessingham is an invalid and so the famous ladynnovelist must continue to work hard one day she comes to a dead stop takes a glass of green chartreuse and proceeds forward with colours flying that is the beginning of the chartreuse habit the rest of the book is the history of her declension to the condition of a secret drunkard living two lives presenting one face to her husband and the world and another to herself in that study where rows of liqueur bottles lay in a locked cupboard yes it is very trite this theme and mrs stannard is sometimes strangely wrong in her details of fact concerning the fiscal side of literature we should like to know for instance how an author who is content to sell all serial rights of a fourthousand word story for thirtyfive pounds could keep up a household with a wagelist alone of four hundred a year mrs lessingham would have got at least sixty or seventy pounds for a story the specimens of reviews and the remarks as to the attitude of the best magazines are also to be frank absurd yet the sheer imagination which is brought to bear on the domestic the artistic and the spiritual existence of this harddriven woman is such that minor faults whether of taste or of accuracy do not seriously count the book is when you have cut into the marrow of it sound strong and convincing it is convincing even in its  happy  conclusion,novel
for lack of gold fr lack of 17l by charles gibbon in three volumes blackic and son mr gibbon has ahievced a great and thoroughly jeyitimatc success the promise lhe gave in his earlier works and especially in  robin gray has been amply fltilled in for lack of gold  and it will henceforth be icicesszry to distinguish him from the promiscuous and epheimeral crowd of nnovelists whose writings serve no falrther purpose than the amiusement of an idle hour it is not too much to say of this nnovel that it is a valuable contribution to thine permanenlt literature of the country entitliingr its author to a high place among contemporary writers of fiction as a story there are few recent nnovels more powerful i and engrossingr than  for lack of gold indeed in this reslpct mi gibbons latest production will compete succesjfally with the mllost popular works of the  sensational  school of nnovelwriters altlhough it differs from thelu essentially in everything but the strength of the emotions it excites here wve have no villain and blat a very moderate expenditure of blood yet the interest time narrative raises and sustains is of the most geniiiuie description the plot is admirably conceived and i skilfully developed and there is a constant succession of stirrimig incidents and striking situations  but the action of the nnovel is only one of diie elements on which the author relics it is to the motives that influence the i actors which in every case adequately explain their conduct that the readers attention is always most specially directed and everything that occurs in they nmental as wvell as in the physical experience of the j characters is satisfactorily accounted for mir gibbons creations are neither bodies without souls nor souls with  out bodies and still less are they puppets without either body or soul tley are veritable and complete s conceptions endowed with every part and attribute of humanity and readily sympathised with and acknowledged as our own flesh and blood but for lack of gold possesses a value and interest apart from its excellence as a story and the truthfulness and vigour of the delineations of character it contains it is a historical work of no small importance and it is on this ground chiefly that we rest the opinion we have txpressed of its merits and worth the scene of mtr giblons nnovel is laid in a country district in scotland and the date appears to be either the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth decade of the present century at that time a number of the more peculiar and character istic social customs and observances of the scottish people that have since passed or are fast passing into desuetude and oblivion were strictly kept and sllcetrely respected the author of this work has evidently made a careful and thorough study of old yule llalloween the lovedarg the feet washing  and in the course of this nnovel he has accurately graphically and concisely described these curious ancient and now nearly obsolete rites and practices the pictures of scottish country life that mr gibbon has woven into his nnovel as a woof across the warp of the story have seldom been excelled and nowhere have the same subjects been treated with equal completeness  for lack of gold may come to be recognised as a standard authority on the festivals that marked the scottish year till about the middle of the nineteenth century its author has fixed in durable colours the lineaments of a state of society at the very moment when it was about to pass away and just before its features had begun to lose the mobility and energy of life he has been fortunate in the selection of his subject but he has also done full justice to it the domestic environment of the heroine of for lack of gold  is not unlike that of the girl whose love and sorrows are so plaintively and pathetically sung in the scottish ballad  hes low doon hes i the broom thats waitin oin me  and their characters bear the closest possible resemblance like the unnamed heroine of the ballad annie blair mill ocomries daughter has a  cankered carl  of a father  whall no twine wi his gear and a sister who discourages her suitor because she has not a  jo  of her own and cannot sympathise with ail affection that is not likely to turn out to be profitable but her mother is not alive to scold her and from all we learn would not have done so had she been alive she has however an abundance of trials to unlergo and through them all the burden of her heart is lat them cay or lat them do its a ane to me for hes low doon hes i the broom thats waitin on me but if the old ballad suggested the character and situation of the heroine of for lack of gold it was merely a suggestion for mr gibbons full and finished portrait is far grander and far more lifelike than the slight pencilsketch of the poem when the story opens angus lamb the son of a neighbouring farmer is betrothed to annie blair but the father of the former having lost his means through signing accommodation bills for the laird of balquherrie the father of the latter is determined to break off the match mtill ocomrie is a strongwilled wrongheaded old man and annie is too well indoctrinated into the idea that she owes unlimited obedience to her father to disregard altogether his wishes and commands the conflict between her natural and acquired feelings is one of the points of the book but it is in the case of mrs lamb anguss mother that the struggle between ihuman nature and scottish calvinism rages most fiercely nnovelreaders will probably compare mrs lamb with one of ar george 3iacdonalds most powerful creationsthe mother of robert falconer and may not in every instance give the preference to i the latter seeing that his daughters heart is set on i angus mill ocomrio looks about for an eligible suitor for her hand and fixes on the laird of balquherrie who is ready to second the millers wishes so far as lies in his power because the dowry promised with annie would relieve the estate from debt and free himself from i the torture he was subjected to by his creditors moreover it would enable him to repay to angus the money he had got from his father and that he argued should make the match acceptable to all parties concerned as a matter of fact however it is not acceptable for angus would rather lose his money than relinquish the hope of one day possessing annie but although the laird approaches the millers daughter with mercenary motives in his breast the affected courtship soon turns to earnest and he falls seriously and deeply in love the relations between angus and the laird now become dangerous annie under the mistaken idea that angus is willing to consent to and that be would be served by her marriage agrees to wed the laird but on the night before the union is to take place the rivals meet on a narrow bridge balquherrie has repented of the second injury he was about to inflict on angus and is returning from the house of the village bellman with whom he has deposited a letter to be i delivered to annie announcing bis resolution and stating that he intends to absent himself from the place for a time he wishes to explain to angus what he has done but angus will not hear him and is hurrying away from the spot lest he should be tempted to any act of violence thereupon the laird unfortunately tries to detami him by seizing hold of his coat and at this angus tur ns round and in dashing htim away accidentally hirlsrl his rival over the low iarapet of the bridge into a deepp oolbelow i3elieving himl to be

quite alone new nnovels by george augustus sala 3 vols chapman  hall this nnovel is and will remain one of the curiosities of literature mr sala explains that half the story was written by him before leaving england as the correspondent of a daily paper more than a twelvemonth ago the publication of it was commenced at a later period in all the year round once engaged in america mr sala lost the thread of his narrative and when some hundred and twenty pages short of his goal ceased all remittances of manuscript it became necessary to bring the btory to an end and another hand was called in mr sala after returning to england preferring a close of his own very naturally promises his readers that if they will clear off the fiist edition as here given by the publishers of whom the ms appears to be the property he will write them a new last act we shall be very curious to see it under these circumstances the critic can only write in some sort conjecturally though five sixths of the tale are before him making allowance however for every drawback announced in this confession it would not be easy to name a more unpleasant story by a man whose fertility of invention and vivacity of style

another man of profligacy and pleasure redeemed in part by his loving recollections of the child who had once sat on his knee during a greenwich orgy belongs we fear to the genus black swan re pulsive however as are many of the people jost enumerated mr sala nevertheless contrives to make us know them all and when he has finished his story in his own way he will perhaps have brought us to tolerate

into the worst provinces of bohemia which contain their magnates as well as the wretched swarm of folk that tumble for their pleasure may find excitement in  quite alone  quite alone is a franklyexpressed  advertisement mr sala explains how it came to pass that the present nnovel which originally appeared in weekly portions in a ll the year round and which bears his name as the author was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the year round began the publication of the story without waiting to have  quite alone by george augustus sb three tolumes london chapom hall the whole of the manuscript in their hands mr sala did his best to finish the task he had set himself but failed  page by page he says  like so many drops of blod about two hundred slips of manuscript oozed from me between spring and summer they were written with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and sudden death in the month of august i brose down altogether and the mails went out without any of my tissue paper i had lost the thread of my narrative i had forgotten the very names of my dramatis pcrsowa i was in a new countrya new world among strange scenes and strange people hurrying from place to place badgered and hated always abused often in peril of my life and under all hazard compelled to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect nnovel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a nnovel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed it many steps beyond the outset from first to last the heroinewhose mysterious isolation suggests the title of the nnovelis the character of whom the reader is permitted to see and know least though it is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year round mr sala invites us to do so in fact promising that if a second edition of the book should be called for he will himself finish it according to his original intention as the story at present stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end clubloungers from the circumstance that she is constantly seen in all places of fashionable resort  quite alone this solitary young woman is the daughter of one francis blunt a roul who has squandered a handsome fortune and taken to pigeoning young spendthrifts as a means of living in splendour her motherwho is the most prominent character in the nnovelis a frenchwoman who has been waitress and drudge at a country inn boarder at a pension and then actress at a parisian theatre where she represented some great wicked lady covered with guilt and diamonds and created a furore the wickedness being portrayed with  rare fidelity from her accurate observation of human nature and the diamonds being bought for her by a man whom her beauty had infatuated and whom she heartlessly ruined by her extravagance from stage heroine she became queen of that section of society called demimonde  up to this time she seemed impregnable diamonds from other quarters than from poor constant were laid at her feet she took them up and laughed

the kaide cole lily is by this time is nearly as she herself can tell nineteen years of age and a model of gentleness and goodness though how she comes to represent so exactly the opposite of the distinguishing characteristics of her parents is mr salas secret if indeed he knows it is at this point that he has stopped the concluding portion of the bookwhich as a piece of literary handiwork does infinite credit to the gentleman who gallantly undertook it in the face of inevitable objectionwinds up the story in a manner thlat can hardly have been such as was contemplated by mr sala

succeeded that he fails we conceive to be in consequence of the method he has chosen in the present work there is abundant evidence of his dramatic faculty his observation of character is little less minute atnd exact than that which he displays with regard to material objects but his inveterate habit of  cataloguincr whatever he sees overrides all else in his mind and apparently destroys his sense of fitness and proportion he constantly works upon his frame to the neglect of his picture with all its faults as a nnovel however quite alone is a very remarkable book containing descriptions

i olv blaki gd work a nnovel john lady   0  ly jeaffreeon auther of i a book about dotos thni volumes chapman and hall decidedly this is one of the best nnovels of the season its defect which is mall arises from overimitation of mr wilkie collins the story is told in the narratives of three people like that of i the woman in whit and the solemn injunction of one diarist julian gower that tabitha tree for whom it is written shall not alter a word imitates too closely one of the weak points of the adopted model also for the sake of increasing interest olive blake while about her good work is made to perplex and grieve the excellent tabitha with mysteries that lead to less than nothing and that she can only explain by saying that it gave her pleasure to torment her friend seeing how nobly she bore torture and how faithful she was to her own heart in spite of every doubt thrust painfully upon it mystery so made is not legitimately made but in good truth mr jeaifreson is not dependent upon story for the success of his nnovel and if it were far more faulty in construction than we think it to be the book would be read with pleasure the most noticeable fact is that the inevitable defects of a tale told by triple autobiography are so far overcome that a man being the author of the book and two of the supposed autobiographers women they do absolutely write like women nice discrimination of character expressed naturallyit is easy enough to express artificiallythrough style would be too much to expect but mr jeaffreson sufficiently distinguishes between the two journalsone that of the active and brave olive blake vigorous in her i good work b7 labouring for years with fearless determination spending all her means to right a wronged woman though success proves her own marriage null the other that of tabitha tree whose womans life of disappointed love takes vengeance on the world only in smiling selfdenial and unobtrusive beneficence it is much that in the journals of these persons the sense of beauty in detail the minute notice of character the love of nature the merciful construction of evil and the faith iin god and in all goodness by which women make life beautiful has been preserved the book ts in direct con1 treat to that nnovel of mr salas of which we have lately spoken it is running over with the milk of human kindness which that writer accounts it clever to reject as lait ddnene used only by the sickly there is in tris stoyo olire blakes good work no trace of sickliness the faith in life is though expressed through the persons of women as manly as it is generous mr jeaffreson instead of proving that the men who please us are all knaves at heart pleasantly disappoints us here and there by showing us an honest kindly man where the experience of nnovel readers would lead them to see preparation for an act of villany solomon easys lawyer is an example of this and the good clergyman of the old school himself with  the corn  country  in which he lives the harvest felds he vists the lanes through which he drives ia his gig and his household with the two girls in whom the story cetre is a sketch more after the manner of the vicar of waked than of the woman in lihije we took up mr jeufreoms nnovel hardly expecting to be pleased for his book about doctors was unsatisfactory but the first chapters of olive blake at once proved that he has in him the right spirit of an artist and the wholo work convinces us that good as this nnovel is better will follow it unless the taste of the day lead its author astray into a de3ire for the couotiou of sensation  plots  olive blakes good work  a nnovel by john cordy jeaffreson 3 vols chapman  hall in olive blakes good work mr jeaffreson has made a great advance upon his former nnovels good as they were the story told is an extremely interesting one a story that will certainly be read through and in some parts more than once by any one who begins it the plan does not reveal itself to the guesses of the sagacious reader until he conies face to face with the solution at the authors own appointed time the reader will also feel compelled to attend to his own duty towards the book  to read it steadily as he reads a living man whom he needs to understand not to advance his knowledge by skipping intermediate steps under the penalty of spoiling his own delight in the authors labours the author docs his duty not only by providing a very interesting story but by telling it remarkably well there is and always will be a fascination in stories of circumstantial evidence there is the hunting instiuct roused to track a fact through all the doublings and windings of concealment a reader loves to assist at the unravelling of a plot or the detection of evidence for himself and not to have it flashed out to him in halfa dozen sentences of explanation in the last chapter where the characters are grouping for the final tableau of happiness and poetical justice previous to the fall of the curtain mr jeatfreson has selected the method inaugurated by mr wilkie collins in his  woman in white the main actors in the drama narrate their own immediate share of the business aud speak ol nothing but what they individually know and feel by this means the reader is kept from seeing too far before him the first part of the story is laid in suffolk in the corn countya district mr jeatfreson knows well and describes with the affection of one who is proud of belonging to the shires the pictures of the old rectory and the kuy quiet fertile country which seems always basking in the sun are charming the rev solomon easy in his canonicals silk stockings and stately silverbuckled shoes examining the villageboys according to the dtclaraticnes of the statutes of the benefaction is a picture from the life the old rectors drives in the ponyphaeton through the lanes and fields to see the crops and his mild childlike complacency at being told he can drive a bargain are all so natural that the reader finds himself asking the childs question is it all true  it is not till the middle of the second volume that he begins to suspect that he is in for a tale with a plot in it the early life of the two sisters in tue quiet rectory the motherly elder sister and her young charge julian gower with his brotherly love all naturally prepare the reader for what comes that the elder sister loves him with the love of a woman and does not discern that to him she is only a great comfort instead of a great hope the painful awakening that her childsister and not herself has won the prize and the loyalty with which she contends against her own disappointment keeping from all reaction of injustice and bitterness are made very touching aud very true mr jeafvreson shows his knowledge of women by a manly aud delicate reverence for them for which women will thank him which shows a far deeper insight than the supercilious display of some writers and some moralists who profes to think that dissimulation and inbred fa lshood rre the badge of all their tribe one of the very best passages in his book is where he goes rather out of his way to pay his own homage to give his owu testimony to their deive to be true und to do the thing that is riht the way in which the older sister bears her disappointment is very skilfully managed th readers sympathy never borders on contempt although we do not think that mr jeaitreson need have protested so energetically aboat her crimson blushes there was no cause for shaine or any sense of humiliation  she was mistaken but she had been misled by circumstances likely to have misled any one and she took up the penalty so bravely that the reader respects her as if she hod won instead of lost in the second volume the mystery of the book begius etty the young sister betrothed to julian linds out that she does not care for him lie is absent pushing his fortune abroad to enable him to keep a wife the grandfather had died some time previously leaving them in thc position whicn obliged them to earn their own living etty disgusted at schoolkeeping discontented with thc prospect of her long engagement elopes leaving no clue behind her except that sho is gone away with a military man elderly ugly taciturn whom nobody had ever suspected of being aware of her existence beyond though most distantly polite recognition the elder sister in the shanie and sorrow of the discovery abruptly leaves the cottage where they had lived since their graudfathers death and goes no one knows where to hide herself from all who ever knew her from this part the mystery becomes highly complex olive blake who has only once appeared before becomes ono of the actors  she marries according to a family compact the friend of though mau with whom etty left her home an excellent man of mature age she tells her own part of the storyhow after she had been a few months married she has a strange visitor a young and beautiful lady who declares that she is married to her husband now arthur petersham was the most unlikely mau in the world to do anything of the sort the reader never for a moment suspects him the character is well managed the reader is made to understand his powers of influence though he only appears in narrative and never in his own person of course the wife does not believe ettys story the marriage she asserts as having taken place at a certain church is not on the register her story is wildly improbable in all its details when her husband comes back she tells him the incident his explanation is perfectly coherent and satisfactory etty never appears again and olive blake never troubles her head further about her this is treated as her sin and we think morbidly exaggerated by the author olive blake is the least natural of all the characters she is too much ofthe personage so frequently met with in old nnovels who has a mysterious knowledge of every ones affairs and who interferes in the crisis of everybodys destiny that olive blake should once startle a person whom she had never seen by her shrewd intuition may be accepted but when it occurs several times it becomes a trick of machinery rather than a trait of character after awhile in her sorrow for the loss of her own child she remembers etty and is morbidly haunted by the recollection of her misery aud her own hardheartedness in though midst of this it comes to her knowledge that her husband excellent sensible affectionate as he has seemed to her and to the world hitherto without a flaw on his surface has in one flagrant instance at least and very recently been a profligate under aggravated circumstances and the conviction is present with her that ettys story is true without waiting to mourn over herself or to think of her own position she separates from her husband and resolves to find etty and to do her justice as she had ample cause for her own separation it excites no surprise or question in society and with mystery and secrecy and unrelenting persistence she sets herself to the work of unravelling the iniquity of her husbands wrong towards etty the difficulties are enormous all clue has been so skilfully and carefully destroyed so many years have elapsed that discovery of evidence seems hopeless the reader is made to assist in the search and to pick up and add link to link of the chain meanwhile the fortunes of the elder sister go on she too has hid herself with care from all who ever knew her she has to be found not by the reader for the reader knows all she is doing but by her friends she has to discover as she believes her sisters child to hear from a strange lady who addresses her in the park a story which is half of it true and half of it intended to mislead her into the belief of her sisters death after a life of shame this portion of the nnovel we object to very much indeedit is a fraud on the purest and noblest feelings of her sisteraudthough entered into with the best of intentions is so cruel so unnecessary that every reader will resent it because olive blake chose to play at providence what right had she to outrage a good and patient and deeplysuffering woman by a story she knew to be false and for the sake of effecting a possible good in an improbable manner  the elder sister deserved better than to be mado a dupe through the whole story olive blake in spite of her good work is detestableher character is not enough worked out to make her strange acts a study of human nature sho remains throughout the machine her conduct to the elder sister after the elaborate plot for bringing her and julian together has succeeded aud we hope she is to be as happy as she deserves is atrociousno other word will suit to try her fine nature to the utmost to see if she can bo unselfish and generous and trust her husband under the extremity of false appearances she goads her with suggestions of diabolical malice and when she has administered her tortuie till her victim faints she allows her to discover that she has been merely trying her olive blake being the mainspring of the book ought to have been made more like a human being or at least to have been developed with more care so that the reader might have accepted her for the sake of increasing his stock of psychological knowledgebut as she stands she is a disagreeable improbability as to etty the victim too much stress is laid on the accident of a legal ceremony it does not in the least lessen her wickedness  it only renders her less unfortunate and gives a reason why arthur petersham should find it worth his while to secrete her in a lunatic asylum after he had abandoned her and married another woman with all faults found aud objections made the reader will not fail to read the story of  olive blakes good work from first to last for the sake of the story and he will return to its pages for the sake of though many noble and excellent sentiments which in the interest of following the story he may not read with the attention they merit mr jeaffreson will yet write a nnovel far superior to olive blakes good work  he possesses though requisite qualities for telling a story to which there will be no exceptions,novel

in silk attire new nnovels by william black 3 vols tinsley brothers allowing for the improbability which lies at the root of this nnovel and which leads to some minor faults of the same kind we say at once that in silk attire is thoroughly pleasant and readable marked by much and varied cleverness mr blacks plot is not in itself a new one the unavoidable rivalry between two girls who are in love with and are almost equally loved by the same man has often been treated but in the present instance the contrast is not so strongly felt as usual both girls are worthy both are unselfish each seems to wish the other to win it must have given mr black great pain to have to cut the knot if we cannot fully sympathise with him that is owing to the way in which the opening improbability is brought back again at the closeand has an air of bringing down the curtain perhaps mr black would urge in excuse that with an actress for his heroine stage effect is allowable he would add further that his heroines mother was an actress and that what is bred in the bone will never come out in the flesh the episode of annie brunels birth and infancy which serves as a prologue to the story has of course been put in for the bearing it has on this side of her character and makes the transformationscene at the end less abrupt but even this does not reconcile us to it wholly and with all mr blacks skill we never quite get over the beginning and the end of his story all we can say in their favour is that the author never loses sight of them they have their effect on the whole conduct of the plot if we forget them now and then and if we enjoy the book most when we do forget them mr black has not set us the example he is consistent throughout and is alike true to what is natural and what is unnatural the faults of the story swell the success of the artist when we dismiss from our minds this aspect of the nnovel we find that in other respects there is a want of absolute freshness and originality pleasant as the characters are and clearly as they are drawn they are only variations on the old types count schbnstein for instance the man who has made a fortune in business and bought a german title without being able to speak the language is merely new in his surroundings we think mr black ought to do better ought to be able to strike out something new in itself instead of contenting himself with placing things in a new light so too mr anerley the father of the hero is intended to be a likeness of the modern materialist and he is great in the scandal he causes to the clergyman of the parish in the difficult theories he inflicts on womankind in the goodnatured sarcasm which is infused into all his words as naturally as smoke is breathed from between the lips that sustain a pipe mr anerley is capitally drawn and we delight in his paradoxes  only we know him already we made his acquaintance in days when materialism had not yet laid its icy clutch upon him when he still went to church or was kept at home by a slight return of his old complaint when he did not suggest that it was a sign of imperfect development in a scotchman not being born with a macintosh here again we think mr black might have done better we have no such objection to make to his two heroines of the two we prefer dove anerley partly because she is more complete in herself partly because mr black so cruelly sacrifices her the change which is wrought in the character of annie brunel when she conies off the stage and mixes with other people is in some sense significant of her part in the nnovel we know more of her as an actress than as a woman yet mr black professes to show her to us as a woman and only to tell us what she did as an actress we must take her great artistic powers and success more or less upon trust and if they seem to us exaggerated we have no means of testing mr blacks account of them but the woman is brought nearer to us and we are called upon to judge her from our natural point of view here we confess dove anerley shows to greater advantage though mr black will hardly see it he may not take it as a compliment to be told that his minor characters do him yet more credit but we are far from intending this to be a censure the distinction that may be drawn between his fulllengths and his miniatures is that in the one we miss either nnovelty or power in the other we are able to do justice to cleverness and observation when mr black sketches the surface of life the daily occurrences when he pictures the retired teabroker acting as country gentleman in kent and still more when the counts foot is on the soil with which he bought his title nothing can be pleasanter the days shooting in the black forest is a perfect scene what with count schonsteins bad german and his general awkwardness what with the fine figure of the tall keeper and will anerleys accident our interest is fully excited and we share the regrets of all the party at the necessity ofa return to england but there are scenes in england which are worthy of being named by the side of this one and english characters by no means inferior to the counts faithful but unintelligible germans all that concerns mr anerley himself is as good as all that concerns count schonstein with the same abatement as to the principal characters and with one grave exception the ruin of the anerleys and mr anerleys last interview with the count are a blot on the nnovel and the more so that they are alien to the usual bent of mr blacks ability at least no other part of the story can be called poor whatever else may be said against it  in silk attire a nnovel by william black in three volumes tinley brothers a strange wild story of our own times very subtly told a young marquis marries an

business after the lapse of a few weeks to offer her whatever income she may desire she covers her broken heart with a mantle of pride and refuses to accept more money than will suffice to carry her to new york where she resolves to resume her profession for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  those whom god had joined  become utter strangers to each other but after a few years the marquis lying on his deathbed repents of the wrong he has done his wife and makes the only reparation now in his power by bequeathing to her and their daughter the whole of his property his executors who hardly knew of her existence have much difficulty in discovering her abode for her theatrical reputation is not now worldwide as it had been in her early days the old fire had gone out when trouble fell upon her when the lawyer waits upon her to announce her good fortune he is astounded by her renunciation of the proffered wealth he begs her to reconsider her decision urging the advantage to her daughter of being placed in the position of an english lady she replies that her daughter has been brought up in total ignorance of her birth and thinks it best that she should remain so she feels acutely how muuch happier her own life would have been had she never passed beyond the bounds of her profession and desires that her daughter should know nothing of the outer world however she will give her the lawyers address and tell her to apply to him should she ever find herself in distress this introduction to the main story for it is the daughter who is the real heroine is improbable in fact and questionable in taste it seems to us a mistake to have opened the book with it calculated as it is to produce an unfavourable impression on the readers mind it would have been better first to have excited an interest in the wonderful annie brunel and then to have gratified the readers curiosity by accounting in some measure for the strongly developed features of her remarkable character in telling the strange story of her birth and the sad tale of her mothers sufferings and wrongs let the reader open the book at the fourth chapter and he will find the orphan girl in london at the zenith of her fame as an actress her juliet is a complete success and we will venture to say as to our authors conception of the character that it is certain be cannot have seen the part so played we must unfortunately go back l to theatrical traditions for such an impersonation of shakespeares betwitching creation l suddenly there was an extraordinary commotion throughout i the house and a burst of that fine strong thunderous music which artists love to hearand then dove saw advance a girlishlooking creature with a calm somewhat pale and interesting face i and beautiful black hair she was only girlish in the slightness i of her figure there was an artistic completeness in her motions and a selfpossession in her bearing which gave her something of a queenly look she wore a magnificent white satin dress the train of which lay in splendid masses behind her and down over this white and gold fell a black lace veil partly hiding the rich i hair and enclosing the clear beautiful dark face dove was spellbound by that face it somehow suggested italy to her and blue skies and music and the passiona artistic warmth of the south nor was the illusion destroyed by the low chestvoice with which the girl replied to the questions of mother and from that moment dove thought no more of mliss brunel and wills friend 1 she saw only juliet and followed her sad story with an aching heart anl trembling lip during the matchless balconyscene will saw this intense sympathetic emotion growing upon the girl i believe it is con e sidered to be the proper thing for young ladies to be able to turn l round and smile compassionately to each other when the traic sadness on the stage is making the women in the pit sob bitterly and raising great lumps in the throats of the mei it is a pretty accomplishment in its way and may be indicative of other l iualities which these young persons arc accused of possessing doves emotional tendencies had never been educated however  and in this balconyscene as i say size watched the lovers with a painful interest which wrote its varying story every moment on her face the theatre was still as death the scarcelyuttered l tendernessesof juliet were heard ts distinctly as if they had been i breathed into ones ear and the yes of the audience frank in  the trembling lights and shadows ot her girlish passion with an unconscious delight and admiration elie abandonment of her affection the reluctant declaratioirs the coy shrinkings and piteous playful tender apologies were so blcnded as to niakc the n scene an artistic marvel and dove sat laughin maist like to greet as the old scotch song says tnii cd she scarcely knew t whether to laugh or cry with the delightthe absolute delight which this piece of true art gave her and wheti at last juliet had forced herself to the partingtis almost morning i would have thee gonc r and yet no farther than a wart nis bird t who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twist gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty  i when lingeringly and sadly she had withdrawn from the t balcony dove rose suddenly and with a halfchoked sob in her voice sad  oh will i should like so much to see herandxd  kies her she had nearly said but thinking it might be ridiculous she stopped  its against the rules dove said will with a smile  be sides that isnt miss brunel youve been looking at tat s b juliet both are very nice ladies bus they are quite unlike eah other a  a a  just as the curtain fell upon the scene in friar lawrences cell at the end of the second act mr melton conducted dove and will down a tortuous little stone stair into a narrow passage from which they entered into the wings a noisy and prolonged reca1 was thundering throughout the house and miss brunel was being led on to the stage by romeo to receive renewed plaudits when x she returned and passed under the glare of the jets in one of the 3 entrances will went forward to shake hands with her  i have to congratulate you again he said  thank you she said simply there had been a pleased smile of welcome in her eyes when r they met and yet it seemed to him that there was a strange intense expression in her look which was not natural to it once or twice before he had seen her in the same circumstances and invariably this unconscious mesmeric intensity was present in her i eyes he explained it to himself by supposing that the emotional idealism of her assumed character had not quite died out of her i yet then she turned and saw dove standing with mr melton will r begged to introduce his sister and the brief ceremony was sufficiently singular for a moment the dark lambent eyes of miss brunel were fixed upon the fair young girl with a sort of s hesitating lookan inquiring apprehensive look which will never forgot then all at once she frankly extended her band l dove a little frightened approached and shook hands with her  mr anerley has spoken to me about you said annie brunel i and dove was conscious that the darkhaired girl before her knew 3 her secret how singular it was to hear herself addressed in those low rich tones which a few minutes ago were addrcssing romeo in the r moonlight dove almost felt herself enchanted and could have ri believed at that moment that she herself belonged to the old sad e sweet play which seems to contain everything that was ever uttered about mans love and womans devotion e i must go down to my dressingroom now said miss brunel f to dove  will you come with me if you are curious to see r the place  i will send some one round with you to your box afterwards  will saw that dove would like to go so he settled the proposal by telling her not to be in miss brunels way and then he and 0 melton returned to the front of the house i while she is on the stage she ceases to be annie brunel  and becomes for the time the character she represents 3but this heavensent actress is mortal she loses her heart i and as the woman developes the actress dies out she begins to feel a loathing for her profession she has become lselfconscious she sees the people who are staring at her i she resolves to quit the stage and then there comes the ivery serious question how to live it is only as a last resource that she applies to the lawyers whose address her mother had confided to her the reader who has followed her thus far who has rejoiced with her in her professional triumphs who has pitied her misplaced love and felt for her in her distresses will be quite prepared to sympathise with her in her prosperity and admire the true nobility of her character equal even to the severe test of sudden unexpected and almost unimaginable wealth indeed the tale would have been more believable had the property been less enormous the rank of her father rather less exalted the ideal actress is admirably contrasted with the real actress a very pleasant kindhearted little lady a staunch friend in adversity though at times addicted to frivolity the lover is a welldrawn sketch of a thorough englishman very well meaning but rather weak in purpose who being engaged to a very tender sweet girl allows himself to fall desperately in love with the brilliant actress and has not the tact to keep his secret his efforts to bind up the broken heart are very commendable but the great truth that it is a mischief past repair is very forcibly and pathetically told the picture of his family circle is a truthful home scene of english country life and life in london amongst theatrical people is admirably sketched there ale pleasant views upon the rhine with its quaint old cities and majestic breadth of waters ruined towers and vineclad hills and some highly picturesque and characteristic scenes in the black forest where the vulgar millionaire of the tale who persecutes poor annie with his addresses has bought an estate which gives him the title of count his attentions to miss brunel are very far from being so disinterested as he strives to make them appear when he urges his suit with the promise that s she shall walk in silk attire for he happens to know who she really is and has a clear intention of claiming her property if he can only cajole her into becoming his wife the pretensions and the soliloquies of this purseproud retired teabroker are very absurd yet we cannot call the character overdrawn the many touches of his apparent generosity in which a reference to the promotion of one or other of his pet schemes may always be detected are very skilfully thrown in and his notion that all the world is bound to do his bidding and help forward his plans is a clever exemplification of the views of many a prosperous mana persuasicf which has probably aided him in achieving his prosperity we wish the book the success it deserves it possesses much originality it is agreeably written the characters are thoroughly lifelike and carefully thought outcertainly the heroine is almost too good to be true we have spoken of her as an ideal for though such an artiste may not now exist it is an accepted fact that such have been and there certainly is no reason why so perfect an actress should not be as perfect a lady as noble as generous as sensitive as truehearted as lovable as teachable as pure we much prefer the creation of so glorious a being to the representation of a mere ordinary mortal those who are not of our way of thinking may find in dove anerley a young lady more suited to their taste  in silk attirm the three first chapters of this story which form a sort of prologue introduce us to annie napier a distinguished actress who while in the height of her fame is wooed and won and married by harry ormond marquis of knottingley who carries his wife to switzerland dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her or otherwise make her life miserable after living with his wife several years on the shore of a swiss lake during which time a child is born to them harry ormond takes a longing to revisit england which he does leaving behind him both wife and child whom he never again sees arriving in england he thinks it better or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better not to return to his wife any more but to live apart from her the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful marchioness of knottingley declining a separate maintenance which he offers her the marchioness retires to new york where under the name of brunel she once more goes upon the stage to which she also trains her daughter annie brunel whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother at the death of the marquis ten years after his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by  acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property of this however she refuses to avail herself choosing rather to live by her profession and she arranges with the english lawyers that even her daughter who knows nothing of her real rank shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality when she may learn her position and claims thus far the prologue the story then follows the fortunes of annie brunel the young american actress who has captivated the heart of london by the brilliancy of her genius we get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the playthe party consisting of mr melton the manager miss brunel with several other members of the company a number of critics aparvenu count the graf von slchonstein will anerley a friend of the count and others who figure in the tale this is among the first glimpses we get of annie brunelslight in figure and somewhat pale and dark there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features and a stateliness in her gestures which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey they were eyes under those long eyelashes capable of a great sadness and yet they were not sad there seemed to play around the beautiful intellectual face a bright superficial unoonsciou activity and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her for the rest she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists and there ended in a faint line of blue and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it the artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of for she wams an arist one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage  for once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter meltabandonment of her impersonations p on the stage she was no longer mistress of herself her eyes deepened until they were almost black her face was stirred with the white light of peasion and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore when the sudden intensity died down when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres she seemed to have come out of a trance not a trace remained of that ore and those intonations which were the result of uncomsious cration her eyes resumed their serene happy indifference her face its pleased childlike expression swif bive dexterous she was full of all sorts of genial marry activities that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dreamlife she led elsewhere this is annie brunel the actress and unknown to herself marchionese of knottingley holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance some of which soon force themselves into fact for it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever the story of her parentage is known to count von schonstein who has it from his brother a member of the firm which is the depository of the knottingleybrunel romance and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play having met mis brunel before in ia sin atty a nnovel b wilim bla author of i love or mariage thm vols losdom  tiniey i america he renews his acquaintance with her in england and with the knowledge of her parentage resolves to marry her if he can expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility one can feel of course that the count cannot be the man and as the result proves in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes he fails but the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness but because a better man is bound to succeed and that man as the prophetic instinct perceives can be nobody but will anerley yet one is puzzled at this for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation in the first place there seems no necessity for it then although as annie brunel and will become acquainted they grow to like each other liking is not exactly loving besides she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady a distant relation of his own dove anerley who has been brought up in his own family down at st marykirby in pleasant kent in spite however of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary though one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that somehow the destinies of will anerley and annie brunel are steadily converging towards each other and will finally become one in the mean time there remains the difficulty of dove anerley whose portrait is thus suggested it was one of those rare faoes which tantalise you in the eryact of admiring them there was nothing in it of that mature vigorous definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman but a tender uncertainty a halfsuggested and shrinking lnoveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features it was not that the girl samed unwell or in any degree fragile but simply that one in looking at her face could not help regretting that her lnoveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes this is the lady who has been the companion of will anerleys youth whom he loves and to whom he has been spiritually if not formally affianced long before he encounters annie brunel but that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change in physical and mental structure will who is the son of a country gentleman is a thorough englishman and is above treachery and deception he does not deceive and desert dove anerleybe does not even cease to love her but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound inspired by the young actress who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentleminded dove it all seems natural and inevitableand as inevitable too that annie brunel should fall in love with will anerley the two are thrown much together during a trip to count schdnsteins residence in the black forest in germany and on wills return to england dove notices the change in manner and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause yet as if foreboding what the end is to be she hardly resents the change in her lover a change also comes over annie brunel remembering the teaching of her mother she conceals her passion for will feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession and even when their mutual affection is confesed they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of dove anerley whom wim is bound in honour to marry the impossible game of suppression goes on for some time when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress the power of genius seems to die within her in the light of her strong passion the idea of a higher life dawns upon her she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her and leaves it almost penniless if not friendless at this time too the anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodgedan event which will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest worse than this to them is the fact that dove having somehow been smitten with cold is now dying of consumption suddenly in the midst of their wellborne distress fortune shines upon them from an unknown place this is the cause of itmiss brunel having at length been reduced to her last shilling and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer does so and there and then discovers that she is the daughter and ole heiressofthemarquisotknottingley although for a time quite stunned by the revelation annie brumnel soon masters the situation and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the anerleys but dove is dyingend from death there is no escape and she knows it but she sewe eager to get mrried to will before she d joa to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife for this purpose she gets will to buy a wedding ring and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words we two loving each other very dearly write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife and as a pledge of our constant love this however remains qnsigned and meanwhile dove getting gradually worse desires to see annie brunel whom will finds in her poor lodging attired in a simple black dress for her great secret is still undivulged i was going to me dove she said when i heard she had sent for me butis there an thing the matter     dove is ill he said abruptly  ii cannot tell you but she wants you to come andplay a

tony butler tony butler blackwood the history of a dashing but impoverished young irish gentleman who fails in every practical attempt to earn his bread and at length is all but mortally awounded while fighting in a quarrel in which he scarcely pretends to take any real interest can hardly be an inspiring theme and yet out of this very unpromising material the author of  tony butler has managed to construct a nnovel exciting and spiriting in many passages and readable throughout story there is little or none the subordinate character upon whose portrait the greatest amount of pains appears to have been sp nt is an uninteresting personage the political intrigues the ordinary reader will care nothing about the ladies are either shadowy or heartless and nevertheless the vivid image of the hero inconsistent as he is with himself in more than one point carries the sympathies of the reader on to the end of the third volume the author has somee how the power of bringing a real man beforus we sympathise with tony when he is snubbed by a dandified hussar we tremble with him at the horrors of a civil service examination we are not disposed to blame him for threatening to kick a saucy foreign office porter we await breathlessly the result of the loss of the private dispatches bv the credulous simpleminded irishman and we heartily rejoice when his troubles come to an end and he inherits a large property and marries a sensible wife the nnovel in fact is properly the life and adventures of tony butler our eyes are fixed on him throughout and the interest which the book has which is not small is due almost exclusivelyto the curiositywhichwe feel to know how the hero will extricate himself from the scrapes into which he is plunged and here we may point out how much more important in a nnovel is the delineation of character than the multiplication or vivid colouring of incident though we would by no means depreciate the exercise of skill and ingenuity on the latter but the reason why tony butlers adventures excite our curiosity and interest is that the actor in them is brought vividly before us and the proceedings under even moderately trying circumstances of a character which we can realise as that of a living man arrests our imagination a thousand times more than those of a mere dumiy exposed to the most sensational perils the story of the nnovel before us is as we have said of the simplest kind a younggentleman of good family but small means residing on the northeast coast of ireland and petted for his good humour and skill in manly exercises by a rich neighbouring family is awakened to a sense of his dependent position bv a coarse insult determining to make his own way in the world he proceeds to london to ask somebody for a place and having by singular good fortune and no small portion of what is vulgarly termed  cheek succeeded in igetting a post as a queens messenger without examination satisfactorily demonstrates his fitness for his duties by allowing himself to be robbed of the first important dispatch with which he is entrusted thinking it wise after this auspicious debut to abandon the public service he finds a berth in a merchants countinghouse in italy but a sense of his utter inaptittude for figures induces him in spite of the entreaties of the merchant to resign that post also and to follow his natural inclination for a row by enlisting under garibaldi under the partisan chief her as might have been expected distinguishes himself and recovers from a desperate wound to find himself in the possession of large estates and in a position to marry a young lady who has long sighed after him such is in a few words the career of the hero but the subordinate characters are numerous and important and the underplot is complicated first of all there is mrs trafford a beautiful and rich young widow a daughter of the house in which tony is a favourite guest at the commencement of the story with her tony is apparently until just the end of the book desperately in love she is perfectly aware of his passion and giv es him all sorts of encouragement but never allows him to come to the point but she loses her interest in him when he grows rich and casts him utterly off seemingly in order that he may find out to his entire satisfaction that he never was in love with her at all and that his affection was really given to the daughter of a presbyterian parson an old playfellow who has always been pining after him and whom he ultimately marries with perfect contentment next there is mr norman maitland really a recruiting officer in ireland for the king of naples and the son of an opera singer of indifferent character but in appearance a swell of the first water an admirable crichton in all things and a man of a mysterious european reputation on this character the author has expended all his pains but hardly with the happiest results the man himself is heartless and the description of his affectai tions tedious while the details of his political intrigues fail to interest us much better is the sketch of his subordinate recruiting officer an irish soldier of fortune one major mcaskey the major is indeed in many respects the most amusing character in the book though the author rather apologises for him the portrait verges on caricature and the colours are boldly laid on but the redheaded unprincipled little condottiere stands out bravely from the canvas nothing can be better than his demeanour in the fashionable drawingroom to which he gains access by a mistake nothing more amusing than his plot to hoodwink and rob the unsuspecting queens messenger and nothings in better keening than his daredevil behaviour among the garibaldians or his plucky mustering and bullying of the runaway royal troops major mcaskey is a character which any writer of humorous fiction might be proud of having conceived and drawn a word of praise should also be given for the descriptions of scenery which never impertinently long bring the locale whether in ireland or italy vividly before us the sketches of countryhouse life too though overladen with unimportant personages are animated land well drawn we cannot conclude without adveiting to one very obvious inconsistency in the otherwise natural and carefully considered character of the hero isle is represented as not only all but uneducated but as incapable through natural dulness of acquiring any kind of booklearning and yet he is for years the chosen companion of highly accomplished girls a constamt guest at their fathers table he holds his own with cultivated people of high rank and when a mere boy seeking for a place is capable of writing a note couched in the most terse and epigrammatic terms we cannot but think that a mere athlete if as thickheaded as tony is represented to be would neither have been a fav ourite at lyle abbey or at the iforeign office but setting this blot aside we are sure that most readers will follow the fortunes of tony butler with interest will enjoy the humour of major mcaskey and will look forward with pleasure to future works from their historian i  tony butler 3 vols blackwood  sons tony butler is an unsuccessful attempt to combine the irish nnovel of mr lever with the later romance of sir edward bulwer lytton from first to labt the reader is reminded of  harry lorrequer and the caxtons of charles omalley and my nnovel but the imitations considered separately do not afford satisfaction and the combination of the two incongruous styles is an unartistic patchwork the writer uses a ready pen and bhows that he is not a novice in the literary craft but either tony butler is his first effort in prose fiction or previous attempts have left him uninformed as to the first rules of the nnovelists art in a certain sense thc book may be commended for cleverness  for each volume contains some flaslks of pleasantry scraps of effective description and happy indications of character serial publication is favourable to inferior nnovels beaders generally exercise a large charity towards stories published in parts attributing the dullness of a number to the system which destroys continuity of interest and commending the entire book for the brightness of an exceptional passage thus the inferior tale which here and there sparkles with merriment or startles with epigram and paradox frequently wins more praise as it runs through a magazine than an artistic story which makes no attempt to seize the good opinion of readers who are wont to dip into chance passages of the new serial tale just for the sake of tasting it and seeing what it is like whilst  tony butler was appearing in monthly instalments it was seen under favourable circumstances here and there it was sprightly  and persons pleased with a sprightly paragraph presumed it was not devoid of plot and character and resolved in consideration of its occasional vivacity to look at it when it should be published in a complete form to carry out their intention will cause them disappointment casual drolleries and fitful pleasantry are unable to carry an ordinary mortal through three long volumes of prose fiction the reader of a thousand closelyprinted pages of such literature requires all the aids and stimulants which are found in good nnovels he must have a story tending from the outset to a satisfactory end  he needs men and women so far resembling human nature that he can believe in their existence whilst the romantic illusion is in full force  he requires his fear to be roused by a possibility of disaster and his hope to be quickened by a probability of good fortune  if the narrative does not alternately rouse laughter and sadness he has ground for complaint and unless the book concludes with a  happy ending he will think twice before he gives the authors next book a fair trial with one exception  tony butler fails to satisfy these requirements it has a happy ending of a very hackneyed sort but the heros sudden acquisition of wealth and capture of a lnovely bride are altogether ineffectual for the writers object since readers do not care a snap of the finger for either bride or bridegroom unless we are mistaken the author at the outset had no definite scheme for the middle and not even a single thought for the ending of his story indeed in a technical sense the nnovel i6 without a story it possesses a population of men and women who make speeches and do deeds but their acts and words have no relation to any grand chain of events or even to a master incident at the middle of the second volume he might without difficulty commence a rearrangement of the last volume and a half causing his characters to change parts and yet defeat no purpose of the earlier portion in character he is less deficient than plot but his chief personages are little more than hints for characters maitland the accomplished man of the world and political intriguer lacks originality but is suggestive  skeffington darner as a humorous burlesque is effective and with proper handling might be made much more so  and enough is seen of the lyle family to create an impression that with greater pains the author could draw female character one personage of the book almost deserves hearty praise and of him the author says  major miles mcaekey is not a foreground figure in this our story nor have we any reason to suppose that he possesses any attractions for our readers how blind some artists are to the play which they are themselves creating for the amusement of others not only is the noisy impudent military adventurer the most piquant and in spite of his vulgarities the most attractive character of the book but he is most unquestionably the foreground figure of the book he is constantly before the reader and altogether eclipses tony butler the hero who is as inconsistent and unsatisfactory a hero as we have met for many a day of gentle birth no fortune and sluggish intellect tony butler at the outset of the story is some twenty years of age and lives with his widowed mother in a wild irish county on a very narrow income his slender education was picked up at a village school and he has never left the immediate neighbourhood of his mothers cottage  he was not clever nor was he very teachable his apprehension was not quick and his memory was bad   dull men are not generally alive to their own dullness  but tony washe saw and felt it very bitterly this heavy youth with his rustic dress and manner takes his thick brain and honest heart to londonto seek his fortune after the fashion of his countrymen he has not been a week in london when he is  notable for keen speeches and philosophic thought moreover the politeness of his tone renders him a  favourite with guardsmen and young men of fashion  occasional reference is indeed made to his pro j vincial style stupidity and ignorance but from the day when he becomes a queens messenger till the death of his uncle who leaves him a magnificent estate tony talks and thinks in the style of a young man who after a course of eton or harrow has born away the honours of oxford,novel

the bride elect 3 vols newby this nnovel without any very great pretensions or lofty aim certainly merits perusal and that is more than can be predicated of the majority of the works of fiction that have appeared this autumn some indeed are so utterly flimsy that we have not deemed it worth while to honour them even with a passing comment the object of the authoress is to expose thc worthlessness and criminality of that most fri volous and despicable animal a male flirt there certainly can be but one opinion on such a subject consequently no amount of odium will be deemed too great to mark the infamy of such wretches fortunately however at the present day they are not found to exist in any considerable numbers mrs ashton the widow of a general had possessed great beauty which her three daugh tera inherited they resided in a pretty villa at kensington were well connected well introduced and enjoyed sufficient means to enable them to indulge in many of the amenities of life mrs ashtons income being however entailed on a nephew it was incumbent upon herin the phraseology of the worldto get her daughters married as speedily as practicable for her sake as well as their own three fair and accomplished damsels mixing much in society of course elicited considerable admiration and ashton villa was the constant resort of a number of danglersmen as we find them here designated of unmeaning attentions or pertaining to the detrimental race the only check upon these frivolous and injurious intimacies was found in a bachelor uncle a mr percy ashton who looking upon his sisterinlaw as a weak fool and his nieces as romantic simpletons was constantly taking them to task upon the subject the old gentleman estimating in its proper light the conduct of these idlers from having half a century previously occupied himself in a similar disreputable manner a beau of the old school mr percy ashton was a small man very erect and with a head so bald that his very large organs of selfesteem and combativeness stood out in alarming relief he was a very fair man naturally and the few hairs time had not thought it worth his while to steal were like his eyebrows and eyelashes snowy white  his eyes were of the lightest blue and of a keen phosphoric brightness  bis teeth beautifully white and even his hands soft fair and taper as the most delicate ladys and kept with a nicety almost feminine in its precision  for unless the halfmoon of each pink and filbert nail was clearly defined old percy ashton was in a perfect fidget in his dress he was as particular as in his person no speck of dust or mud was ever seen on his black dresscoat of superfine cloth his pantaloonsfor ho scorned trousers  or his glistening shoes his linen seemed as if it had been got up by the fairies so fine so white so clear and the plaits of his frilled shirt and small ruffles so even and minute he was very proud of a fine leg and a small and beautiful foot and with the singular whiteness of his face and hands his snowy linen and exquisite neatness and cleanliness his brilliant brooch and ring and his very courtly and aristocratic bearing no one could pass him unnoticed or fail to regret that so very few specimens remain of the london gentleman of the old school he was a constant visitor at the little villa and a great favourite with his pretty nieces penelope blanche and isabel each of whom had respectively for cavalier bernard brydges trevor templeton and captain beresford although extremely assiduous in flirtation none of these gentlemen are in any degree earnest in their attentions yet each poor girl fancies that her young affections are ardently reciprocated hy her pseudo lover and firmly believes that the all important proposal is only deferred on account of some temporary obstacle bernard brydges is a young man of prcpos sessing exterior fascinating manners small means and no expectations trevor templeton an undergraduate at oxfordthough a very bad specimen of his classresembles brydges in several respects but has the additional advantage of a wealthy uncle with a daughter and a rich advowson both from his earliest youth destined for himself beresford depicted with the ordinary conventional characteristics of that class of army men who have no intention of seeing service is besides a litterateur in a small way with an opinion of himself by no means justified by his successes as an author all three are vain selfish and unprincipled to a degree caring little what pain they may inflict on such hapless maidens as may fall in their way so long as they amuse themselves and add to the boasted number of their victims old percy well aware of the danger his fair protegees are daily incurring cautions them and their mother as to their conduct at a ball and at the same time takes occasion to inveigh strongly against that ungraceful and odious mixture of a jig and a hug the polkaa dance now happily all but banished by the good sense of the community to thirdrate coteries and casinos percy ashton loquitur the polka at the last ball i went toa fancy balla powdered beau of george the seconds time was polking with a pretty swiss peasant with braided black hair anda bunch of scarlet flowers in her bosom  her black hair was powdered too before the end of the polka and on his white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold the print of her scarlet flowers was taken as by transfer i leave you to judge what sort of a dance that must have been how the ladys and gentlemans heads must have come together and how close must have been the contact to leave on his breast the print of the flowers in hers oh its odious its degrading its indecent even and worse still its vulgar ugly inelegant a girl never looks so awkwarknever seems so littleas when shes being jogged along in the hideous innovation on all our national feelingsi will not say prejudices in england too its so badly done such a clumsy exaggeration such a caricature oh ive no patience with it it has been remarked that since the polka came into fashion matrimony has gone out spinsters are alarmingly on the increase and i dont wonder at it as the cleverest woman i know said to me at that same ballthe girls of the present day begin where we used to leave off i e with an embrace the severest thing that has been said yet well said isabel i quite agree with uncle percy and that is the reason i never will dance the polka the authoress is especially severe against this dance and on another occasion observes  i do believe that odious polka has put the finishing stroke to womans influence and mans reverence for the sex it has broken down the wild sweetbriery fence it is so much to beautys interest to keep unimpaired it throws her a cheap burthen into the arms of a succession of supercilious puppies and it is so very inelegant a dance that she loses caste not only with her partner but with all the men who look on to sneer but not to admire  well it is a vulgar ugly dance enough and ouch a bore i dont care how soon it goes out im no very devoted squire of dames and really i do not wish to carry a heavy girl in a sort of halfjig halfhug with her head on my shoulder and then be expected to follow it up aux petits soins for ever after till though day of my death or marriagemuch the same thing one george addington a banker with

creepers close to london or some fashionable wateringplace with good society and plenty a double coachhouse and a conservatory in short a cottage of gentilityis pleasant enough for a  honeymoon that is the only sort of cottage in which lovethe love of a certain classcan condescend to dwell it has been often tried and is always a miserable failure the love that would last through life when

preference you have shown me havo led me frankly to accept your generous proposals i cannot say that i feel at all worthy of the distinction of being selected from among so many fauer more gifted and more richly endowed in every way to be the partner of your fortune and the mistress of your establishment but i shall feel proud to be the wife of one so good and noble and henceforth my chief study will be to make myself worthy of the honour you have done me had mr addington been more experienced in womankind he would have known that this kind fluent and amiable language was not that of a fond weak womans heart but of a clever womans head there was none of the faltering confusion the fascinating tautology the fearful joythe fear the shame the bliss almost painful in its intensity the thoughts too deep for utterance the feelings all too delicate for words mr addington was far too much in love all banker as he was to have a notion at that moment except of his own rapture and his brides condescension he tried to take the hand she extended to him he tried to speak his gratitude but he was far too much overcome for eloquence and so after exclaiming  oh miss ashton iyouall the

she certainly wasbut ashamed too of feeling so little when the man she had accepted as a husband felt so much with his handkerchief still to his face he rose and went to the window and for some minutes penelope could see by the heaving of his breast as she stole a view of him en profile that ho was mastering great emotion  he is to be my husband she thought and therefore i must act as if i

pinmoney miss ashton in her new character receives an invitation to pass a few weeks with the mother of her  futur a pragmatical disagreeable rheumatic old woman whose thoughts and affections are entirely centred in her son during her stay at addington lodge a few miles from brighton penelope discovers that bernard brydges between whom and herself all communication has recently ceased is residing at brighton she contrives and obtains more than one interview with the man who still holds undivided possession of her heart hoping that she may yet induce him to aid her in escaping from a fate in spite of its brilliancy becoming more odious the nearer it approaches she could bear that bernard should know she was going to marry mr addington she could not endure the thought that he should fancy she loved him she wished to be embalmed in his memory as a victim she could not tolerate the thought of figuring there as the contented prosperous affectionate wife of a middleaged banker and yet how could she undeceive him  had he not seen her weeping by mr addingtons side his arm round her waist her head on his shoulder what agony she felt at the idea that he would never believe that she had sacrificed herself it soon transpires however that brydges real object in haunting the same part of the country as his poor inamorata is not alas his love for her but a strong affection he has lately conceived for the shekels of miss addington a spinster of mature age frivolous disposition and very small personal attractions but with a reputed fortune of 70000 he contrives to obtain an introduction to the mother and an invitation to the same house in which penelope is staying poor miss ashton suddenly misinterprets the vile deceivers motives one day looking from her window mistaken motives she saw dora ridiculously overdressed and assuming the most jaunty coquetry of manner sporting about the lawn and along the shrubberies with bernard brydges she was followed by a little snowwhite french poodle that penelope had never seen before and which lier jealous heart suggested bernard had perhaps given but as she dressed herself in a new and elegant costume and as the glass reflected her cheeks hushed with emotion her eyes tull of passionate fire her form so proud and so perfect and the beauty over which love shed a lustre love alone can shed she contrasted her own exquisite grace and beauty with the little unshapen form gaudy attire sandy hair weak eyes and quaint absurdity of the figure ambling by bernards side and she felt ashamed of her own momentary jealousy had she in weighing herself and dora in the scale just put in seventy thousand pounds on doras sidethat sum in which bernard brydges whole soul is in reality wrapped uphow different would her deduction have been  poor dear bernard how he must love me to tolerate her and her odious advancesmiserable attempt at coquetry and wearisome affectations for my sake but ai in my side wlat nave  not

rae today various notes are interchanged penelope being eager to fathom brydges meaning while he is only anxious to lull her suspicions till he can elope with the  fortune that has awakened his cupidity one of these epistles to bernard brydges in penelopes hand is at last discovered and causes a frightful catastrophe the unlucky missive insisted on a meeting and an explanation early the following morning miss ashton appointed the place and she had determined to impart to her quondam admirer her resolution to break off the match with mr addington and to insist on bernards leaving her for ever unless he chose to accept the sacrifice she was so eager to make and to elope with her himself bernard brydges had however arranged a meeting of much more importance in his eyes mr addington and his mother came to the trysting place instead the eclaircis9ement it was a summerhouse that overlooked the road to london she waited for some time in miserable anxiety and impatience and bernard brydges did not come she began to fear he had deceived her burning shame dyed her cheeks anger and despair lighted her eyes and fired her breast she was about to leave the spot when the sound of carriagewheels in though road beneath attracted her attention  a postchaise and four dashed by the blinds were drawn down but one was suddenly raised and the face of dora looked up at the summerhouse yes dora waved her hand triumphantly to the bride elect bernard brydges shrank back in the carriage and hastily pulled down the blind penelope did not see his face but she did see his hand his white kid glove proclaiming the bridegroom oh there was not a doubt not a miserable doubt left he had been trifling with her keeping her quiet making a tool of her his sole object being that miserable halfwitted heiressno no there could be no doubt hannah is in the rumble with some jeering valet and both look up aud both laugh yes she sees them both laugh as fixed like a statue of despair her hair streaming in the damp morning air her form rigid her lips ana cheeks marblewhite and her hands tightly pressed upon her tortured bosom she stands at the entrance of that bower still looking wildly after the carriage and four round which rise such clouds of dustemblems as bernard thinks and whispers to the enraptured dora of what he would compel her brother to come down with slowly penelope turns with shivering horror and prepares to leave the spot as she does so she utters a faint cry for the first objects that meet her eye are mr addington and his mother she sees in a moment that they know all he is ghastly pale but stern and haughty and in his just indignation he looks almost dignified in his hands he holdsoh god yes it is her own note he held it out to her she tried to take it but a sharp cry burst from her lips her eyes flashed wildly all her features worked her limbs became convulsed she attempted to speak but could not articulate presently her knees shook her arms dropped and she fell heavily on the ground mr and mrs addington looked at each other they knew not what to do  do not touch her do not condescend to touch her reptile that she is said mrs addington  i will go and send some of the servants to carry her not to our house i but to the  no no mother in this statecruel treacherous aud base as she has beeni cannot leave her and remember we have had no

at your feet this is the true state of the case my poor poor boy and you have only to thank heaven for an escape which to me seems like a miracle vouchsafed to save you the poor girl after a terrible illness recovers her health but her reason has fled for ever brydges finds that his wifes fortune is notas lu fondly anticipated at her sole disposal but entirely dependent on the will of her brother who generously allows the newlymarried couple 2007 a month to be paid to her so long as they lived happily together but to be paid to her alone if a separation should at any time take place between them we shall leave our readers to discover for themselves the histories of isabel and blanche together with the fate of their two graceless lovers merely adding that the respectable banker unites himself and his fortune to the amiable daughter of a poor clergyman the poor girl having long secretly entertained a passion for him the nnovel is written in an amusing style though here and there we detect errors not unfrequent in works of the class to which this pertains the more prominent attributes of the male characters in order that they may appear more striking are overdrawn and the language they are now and then made to utter is such as could never in reality have been used by gentlemen imagine for a moment any oxford man above the rank of a college  scout accosting the young lady to whom he is presumed to be paying his addresses in such insulting words as these  i say blanche whats the matter with pen  has bernard brydges moved off and has the old lady been kicking up a shindy  i could have told them bernard was no go ihe s not made for double harness and with all his pretence of love and sentiment tin is his idol and by jove he s righttake my word for it such expressions would hardly be tolerated in the servants hall at any rate no lady with english blood in her veins would ever admit a second time to her boudoir a brute who could demean himself thus grossly we might quote several other passages of a similar character but we shall content ourselves with one it is an extract from a letter of the same oxford man 441 say old boy dont you wish she may get it the old cat keeps aloof and lets me do much as i like with her pretty and playful little kitten shethe old pussis lpatle dc velours now but i suspect no mouse ever had a sharper run for bis life than i shall have for my liberty when she discovers that i dont mean to let her and her daughter  walk into nie and my good living what fangs and claws then old boy wont it be glorious sport  there are however other perhaps somewhat more venial errors which should also be sedulously avoided on future occasions since they can only be attributable to the ignorance of the writer or the carelessness of the printers  reader the authoress in her dedication to her brother professes  a truly feminine reverence for his finished scholarship c c we think it would not be amiss were she the next time she publishes to submit her proofsheets to that gentlemans critical eye her readers then would probably be spared such sad blunders as these  it was pain to give you up but to give up stultz hoby verey et cetera omnibus  would be greater pain still  bernard brydges possessed all the minor virtues in perfection punctuality politeness neatness order cleanliness et cetera paribus   lamour est comme la petite verole qui fait dautant plus de mal quih vous prend tara by the way in almost every french quotation of which there are not a few the words are grossly misspelt and the accent is

captain beresford we are repeatedly told is a comet in the dragoon guards how are we to reconcile this anomaly  however notwithstanding numerous similar errors the intention of the writer is evidently

the engrafted bose by emma brooke a new nnovel by the author of a superfluous woman the title refers to bosamunda thoresbye a changeling for threequarters of the book the reader knows that she is a changeling but can only suspect at random whose child she really is an implacable old squire an illfated estate and the two lovers of bosamunda help to make up a story which would be more attractive were it not so heavily charged with fate and the sense of impending calamity hutchinson 6s  the engrafted rose by emma brooke hutchinson 6s here is a good nnovel at once strong and sound says the author in a passage dealing with the principal heroine rosamunda thoresbye  to be a genuine artist is to view all the parts of existence with a special temperament it is to possess a clue to the meaning of things which others are unaware of to have an unwritten law of ones own by which to test all the manifestations of life and conduct the power of the artist is a light cast everywhere it is this light cast everywhere this continual poetising of reality without distorting its truth which makes the engrafted rose notable among the fiction of the day mrs brookes somewhat melodramatic theme turns upon the fortunes of the old aristocraticbarbarian family of clarels who had lived for centuries at a seat called marske all the placenames and surnames in this nnovel have a fine northern sound clarel marske hawmonde liedes thirntoft twelves brackenholme ronaldsbiggin we see the working of the clarel blood in three people clement clarel who sold his happiness and that of others to enable him to transmit the family traditions unimpaired bryan hawmonde a distant cousin whose existence is a prolonged defence of his own individuality against the herd of ancestors  within him and eosamunda thoresbye who changed at birth by an unscrupulous midwife lived for twenty years under the impression that she was the daughter of eminently just and respectable millowning parents mrs brook succeeds better with her women and older men than with her young men bryan hawmonde meant to be an elaborate figure is analysed before he has been constructed and his friend earnshaw who marries eosamunda scarcely seems alive the chief blot on the book lies not in the theatrical prologue which is managed with all necessary skill but in the chapter recording eosamundas gipsylike adventures after she has learned the secret of her birth these adventures never occurred they are utterly wronga trick played upon the author by an imagination which approaching the end of a heavy task had become slightly hysteric and unstable but whatever the faults of the engrafted rose impotence is not among them even its crudities and they are not fewhave interest  the engrafted rose by emma brooke 6s hutchinson surely now if not before miss brook has found herself her book  the engrafted rose is a work of unhurried excellence cleverness and a steady certain power impress themselves on us in every chapter and not only cleverness and power but also the understanding which comes from the heart alone there is no single character in the story who has been treated with a moments carelessness  there is not one which could be spared the main motive of the book is the development of a girls strong nature and in accomplishing this the development of other natures weak and strong is skilfully shown events are deftly woven and the plot goes forward with inevitableness  but first and beyond all the author gives her intellect and her care to the depicting of rosamunda the beautiful strongwilled stronghearted  engrafted rose and in the face of this creation the actual story the plot the rights and wrongs of the other characters good as they all are take a secondary place in a different manner but with scarcely less ot talent and ability has been depicted the character of mrs thoresbye the supposed mother of the heroine  ahe is one of the chief delights of the book fresh and unique to the end of the story miss brook indeed convinces us of her powers of observation and insight there is one small point on which we differ from the nnovelist in the supremest moment of miss emma brookkl from photo by bassano 25 old bond street rosamundas life where she awakens to the flooding realisation that she loves miss brook writes  and then one day she realised that this preoccupation with a single personality was love was passion if miss brook is writing merely of rosamundas case doubtless she knows and is right but if she is speaking generally we feel that she is not right it is a pity or a mercybut she is wrong in five cases out of ten for this absorption this concentration this  preoccupation with a single personality there may be one of a score of reasons exceptionally strongly felt of course but not indubitably love but on the last page of miss brookes book we read  all we need know is that there is a shadow and a misery less in the world perhaps in conclusion we may sayall we need know is that there is a good book and a pleasure more in the world certainly this is a fact,novel
new nnovels londons heart by b l faijeon author of grif c in i three volumes tinsley brothers all the scenes in this nnovel are laid in london and its vicinity and it is probably because the greater part of the incidents described in it take place in soho which the author seems to consider the central district of the metropolis that he has entitled his work ilondons heart the name however is susceptible of another explanation in a chapter headed  the beating of the pulse mr farjeon takes his readers to the royal white rose musichall and after describing the  throng of nightbirds dressed in gay plumage who frequent the neighbourhood and  a childgirl staggering along drunk who was affording agreeable amusement to the mob he breaks into an apostrophe beginning  0  londons heart laden with the sorrow of such lifeblood as this  as the phrase does not occur in any other passage in the book it might not unreasonably be inferred that in the writers opinion the aforesaid musichall is in a real or symbolic sense the heart of london there is much in the nnovel that appears to support this view the royal white rose musichall is the point from which the action of the story proceeds and we should not be surprised if the author intends us to regard that institution as an appropriate embodiment and reflection of the social and moral life of the metropolisthe great world of london in miniature that the picture of this musichall may have something of an allegorical character is farther suggested by the fact that it cannot be accepted as a truthful and unexaggerated representation the royal white rose is depicted as a hotbed of the coarsest and most vulgar vice in which however blooms one virtuous flower that not only escapes the contamination surrounding it but looks all the fairer and more lnovely by the contrast lily verity the heroine of the book is a marvel of innocence being as ignorant of the evil ways of men of the world as she is free from any disposition towards any form of sin and yet she is the sentimental  star  of the royal white rose musichall otherwise she is not by any means a remarkable girl the hero is a somewhat less shadowy creation but he also is little more than a foil to set off the weak and wicked characters in the nnovel it is with the doings of a turfswindler and his dupe that the readers attention is chiefly occupied and the main purpose the author appears to have had in view in writing this book is to expose the vices and crimes of the wornt class of betting men other iniquities such as the overworking of railway pointsmen and the unj ust decisions of the unpaid magistracy are incidentally illustrated but the principal representatives of london society outside the group of which lily and her lover are the most prominent figures are david sheldrake a consummate scoundrel living by his wits and alfred verity a singularly foolish and selfish young man who robs his father and his employers becomes the tool as well as the victim of sheldrake and gets into serious trouble from which his sister lily and her friends triumphantly rescue him i i it will be seen from what we bave said that the phases of london life depicted in this nnovel are of an exceptional and not of a typical character the dramatis persona are as a body an odd lot of beings mr farjeon is a disciple of mr charles dickens and the best writing in his book consists of the passages in which he has most closely imitated the style of dickens podmore the pointsman who never comes upon the scene except in a state of extreme exhaustion and always tells us he is dead beat mrs podmore and her daughter  pollypod  j gribble senior the oil and colourman who puts a sheet of notepaper into his window  on which is written in feeble and uncertain letters  down with cooperation  and 3 gribble junior the proprietor of  the royal umbrella and parasol hospital secondfloor front are all quaint and amusing creations truer to dickens than they are to life it is not necessary that we should say anything about the plot of this nnovel as it depends comparatively little for any interest it possesses upon the plot which mainly serves the purpose of connecting together the incidents and descriptions the book is essentially superficial but it moves rapidly over the ground and is written with a certain smartness if the reader is not exacting and seeks only for diversion he may be able to wile away an hour or two not unpleasantly over  londons heart g t,novel
the youthful impostor by h m reynolds 3 volsthis nnovel is framed on the story of that foolish and wretched person called  thc fortunate youth and even the discovery of the imposture is adopted in the fictitious history which took place in the real upon this groundwork is raised a pile of events improbable and most revolting consisting of robbery swindling seduction adultery and parricide the profligacy of the french nnovels is now infusing itself into our own we perceive both from allusions and from occasional references that they are read by the writers of similar works in our country  and as ours are written with all the disgusting and loathsome impurity and profligacy of the french but without the skill and talent we sincerely hope that the only way to put a stop to them will be adopted by the good policy of the publicnot to purchase or read them the present is totally unfit for the perusal either of a young man ora young woman we hope in charity that the name of the writer is fictitious,novel
goddesses three by d hugh pryce 2 vols bentley  son  goddesses three  appears to have been constructed by a somewhat unpractised hand it makes rather a poor beginning and a worse finish by introducing a family who have little or no bearing on the course of events and action of the story between the start and finish there are better things however and some interesting people placed amid interesting surroundings the principal of the three girlsthe goddessesis speedily transported from london to the home of her maternal cousins an old house in a small austrian town in the heart of most wild and romantic scenery they are a pleasant trio of girls and the contrast between the sisters and their cousin is well kept up this part of the book is more amusing than the rest several of the seople are carefully and not inconsistently rawn there is however a want of unify as well as equality in the writing the story which seemed in its nature destined to be a tragedy comes suddenly to a cheer full ending,novel
the bankers wife or court and city a sovvl by mus iokk authoress of mothers and daughters  mrs armitage c the wholesome moral which mrs lore has here endeavoured to enforce is epiite sufficient to elevate her book out of thc class of works of mere amusement into that far higher one of useful teaching the excursions of the imagination when they make no further pretensions may elevate the fancy or in other forms refine the feelings pictures of life may teach us to know the world better  portraits of men may make us more intimately acquainted with the various characters of our fellow beings all these have their respective merits but the endeavour to make all these subservient to the higher aim of enforcing a pure morality and teaching a sterling and useful lesson through a pleasurable medium deserves a higher commendation anel this has been mrs gores strenuous endeavour in  the bankers wife commencing with a minor point we must object to the title the bankers wife is not the leading personage of the history unless on the supposition that she suffers most and that quiescently assuredly the saddest shape of endurance  but even this species of preeminence we are obliged to repudiate because though anguish may be deeply engraven on the surface of the heart it is only remorse that eats into its core the banker is the real hero of the tale and is depicted both with spirit and accuracy position in life is the one thing for which men universally strive to struggle up but never to slide downwards is the great object of the world a little higher and yet a little higher is the still stimulating never satisfied desire of the heart without this craving after an everreceding good which is the bane of peace and the poison of present enjoyment man might and would most generally bc satisfied with his lot since it is not so much on existing evil as on desired good that he founds his dissatisfaction  it is in the desire for happiness which is the shadow that he disregards contentment which is the substance thus the banker makes aggrandisement his aim to keep his position in society nay to elevate himself above it be spends his days in toil his nights in care with the means of ample comfort in his power he rejects its enjoyment for the sake of gaining another step higher in thc work with a wife whom mrs gore has with poetical license made quite perfect and children in whom affection might fairly concentrate and centre his feelings are all poisoned at their spring and turned out of their natural channel it is a sad and dark concomitant of almost every species of crime that it is attended by that other of all the basesthypocrisy but few of the sins of thc world walk avowedly unveiled vice still pays that homage to virtue as but seldom tei show an unabashed unblushing front and hence the intimate connexion of the large family of evil to avoid detection commission follows on commission one sin treads on the heels of another to screen it from observance thus the banker influenced solely nt first by the desire to support the position in life which his deceased parent had occupied gradually gives up every hold on rectitude after exhausting his own resources he trenches on the bankinghouse funds and so there follows a long line of actions of increasing turpitude and the lost man struggling to protract his own utter ruin sometimes trembling at the shadow of a straw sometimes blind to overhanging mountains threatening to fall upon and crush him  labouring like a slave at the galleys oar yet strenuously supporting an aspect of ease devoured with the vulture at his heart yet dressing his lip with miiiles at last becomes that saddest of all things his own victim but the character of the banker is admirably contrasted and the moral of the tale powerfully enhanced by the old hast indian nabob a man who saving and excepting his wealth which he is generous enough not to value for its own sake has been bereft of everything near and dear to a heart abounding in love and home affections a wife on whom he doted with that oldfashioned sort of intensity which has become so outree in modern days and sons grown up to an honourable manhood had all been snatched away wearied with the scenes amid which he had amassed his stores of rupees the old nabob had sought his native land to find himself forgotten by the friends ol his younger days and with all the work of the heart if we may be allowed the expression to begin afresh but the impulses of that heart or rather the fullness of its riches outbursting their overnan ow garnerhouse soon surround the aged and bereaved man with a very atmosphere of love making the happiness of others by a nevertiring generosity he receives the gladness back again reflected into his own bosom while thc banker with every social relationship of life gathered around him is yet as joyless as if he were alone in the vast world true it is that the innate nature and not the outward circumstances makes the reality of a mans true condition the moral worked out by the actions of these two opposite characters is theprimary object of the tale and with this purpose our interest in the remaining personages has been kept subordinate while desiring to clo justice to the real merit of the work we are not however blind to its weaker points a little of the vapidness into which mrs gore sometimes falls in her delineations of fashionable life is manifest in the less exciting portions of the narrative  and a matter of some surprise when we are considering the productions of a lady there isa feebleness in those parts which are devoted to sentiment while the strength is all expended on its sterner portion contrary to ordinary example the love affairs are not prominent and whether intentionally or not the characters of the banker and the nabob stand conspicuous throughout upon the whole we consider 4 the bankers wife as one of the best of mrs gores numerous productions,novel
the bride elect 3 vols newby this nnovel without any very great pretensions or lofty aim certainly merits perusal and that is more than can be predicated of the majority of the works of fiction that have appeared this autumn some indeed are so utterly flimsy that we have not deemed it worth while to honour them even with a passing comment the object of the authoress is to expose thc worthlessness and criminality of that most fri volous and despicable animal a male flirt there certainly can be but one opinion on such a subject consequently no amount of odium will be deemed too great to mark the infamy of such wretches fortunately however at the present day they are not found to exist in any considerable numbers mrs ashton the widow of a general had possessed great beauty which her three daugh tera inherited they resided in a pretty villa at kensington were well connected well introduced and enjoyed sufficient means to enable them to indulge in many of the amenities of life mrs ashtons income being however entailed on a nephew it was incumbent upon herin the phraseology of the worldto get her daughters married as speedily as practicable for her sake as well as their own three fair and accomplished damsels mixing much in society of course elicited considerable admiration and ashton villa was the constant resort of a number of danglersmen as we find them here designated of unmeaning attentions or pertaining to the detrimental race the only check upon these frivolous and injurious intimacies was found in a bachelor uncle a mr percy ashton who looking upon his sisterinlaw as a weak fool and his nieces as romantic simpletons was constantly taking them to task upon the subject the old gentleman estimating in its proper light the conduct of these idlers from having half a century previously occupied himself in a similar disreputable manner a beau of the old school mr percy ashton was a small man very erect and with a head so bald that his very large organs of selfesteem and combativeness stood out in alarming relief he was a very fair man naturally and the few hairs time had not thought it worth his while to steal were like his eyebrows and eyelashes snowy white  his eyes were of the lightest blue and of a keen phosphoric brightness  bis teeth beautifully white and even his hands soft fair and taper as the most delicate ladys and kept with a nicety almost feminine in its precision  for unless the halfmoon of each pink and filbert nail was clearly defined old percy ashton was in a perfect fidget in his dress he was as particular as in his person no speck of dust or mud was ever seen on his black dresscoat of superfine cloth his pantaloonsfor ho scorned trousers  or his glistening shoes his linen seemed as if it had been got up by the fairies so fine so white so clear and the plaits of his frilled shirt and small ruffles so even and minute he was very proud of a fine leg and a small and beautiful foot and with the singular whiteness of his face and hands his snowy linen and exquisite neatness and cleanliness his brilliant brooch and ring and his very courtly and aristocratic bearing no one could pass him unnoticed or fail to regret that so very few specimens remain of the london gentleman of the old school he was a constant visitor at the little villa and a great favourite with his pretty nieces penelope blanche and isabel each of whom had respectively for cavalier bernard brydges trevor templeton and captain beresford although extremely assiduous in flirtation none of these gentlemen are in any degree earnest in their attentions yet each poor girl fancies that her young affections are ardently reciprocated hy her pseudo lover and firmly believes that the all important proposal is only deferred on account of some temporary obstacle bernard brydges is a young man of prcpos sessing exterior fascinating manners small means and no expectations trevor templeton an undergraduate at oxfordthough a very bad specimen of his classresembles brydges in several respects but has the additional advantage of a wealthy uncle with a daughter and a rich advowson both from his earliest youth destined for himself beresford depicted with the ordinary conventional characteristics of that class of army men who have no intention of seeing service is besides a litterateur in a small way with an opinion of himself by no means justified by his successes as an author all three are vain selfish and unprincipled to a degree caring little what pain they may inflict on such hapless maidens as may fall in their way so long as they amuse themselves and add to the boasted number of their victims old percy well aware of the danger his fair protegees are daily incurring cautions them and their mother as to their conduct at a ball and at the same time takes occasion to inveigh strongly against that ungraceful and odious mixture of a jig and a hug the polkaa dance now happily all but banished by the good sense of the community to thirdrate coteries and casinos percy ashton loquitur the polka at the last ball i went toa fancy balla powdered beau of george the seconds time was polking with a pretty swiss peasant with braided black hair anda bunch of scarlet flowers in her bosom  her black hair was powdered too before the end of the polka and on his white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold the print of her scarlet flowers was taken as by transfer i leave you to judge what sort of a dance that must have been how the ladys and gentlemans heads must have come together and how close must have been the contact to leave on his breast the print of the flowers in hers oh its odious its degrading its indecent even and worse still its vulgar ugly inelegant a girl never looks so awkwarknever seems so littleas when shes being jogged along in the hideous innovation on all our national feelingsi will not say prejudices in england too its so badly done such a clumsy exaggeration such a caricature oh ive no patience with it it has been remarked that since the polka came into fashion matrimony has gone out spinsters are alarmingly on the increase and i dont wonder at it as the cleverest woman i know said to me at that same ballthe girls of the present day begin where we used to leave off i e with an embrace the severest thing that has been said yet well said isabel i quite agree with uncle percy and that is the reason i never will dance the polka the authoress is especially severe against this dance and on another occasion observes  i do believe that odious polka has put the finishing stroke to womans influence and mans reverence for the sex it has broken down the wild sweetbriery fence it is so much to beautys interest to keep unimpaired it throws her a cheap burthen into the arms of a succession of supercilious puppies and it is so very inelegant a dance that she loses caste not only with her partner but with all the men who look on to sneer but not to admire  well it is a vulgar ugly dance enough and ouch a bore i dont care how soon it goes out im no very devoted squire of dames and really i do not wish to carry a heavy girl in a sort of halfjig halfhug with her head on my shoulder and then be expected to follow it up aux petits soins for ever after till though day of my death or marriagemuch the same thing one george addington a banker with

immolated at the altar to mammon her sisters take care to impart to brydges the state of affairs nothing doubting but that a hint on the subject will be sure to produce an offer it draws forth the following historiette love in a cottage  ah sweet miss blanche these things do very well in books and dreams but trust me though a swiss cottage with its fragrant porch and festooned by varied creepers close to london or some fashionable wateringplace with good society and plenty a double coachhouse and a conservatory in short a cottage of gentilityis pleasant enough for a  honeymoon that is the only sort of cottage in which lovethe love of a certain classcan condescend to dwell it has been often tried and is always a miserable failure the love that would last through life when properly supported and varied by society elegant pleasures change travel and all the accessories of wealth left to its own unaided resourcees soon exhausts them  fancy a coupleof our own class we will

specially appointed for the purpose tue lover accepted  your correspondence with my mother has informed me that you have done me the honour of selecting me to be your wife and my reflections on the preference you have shown me havo led me frankly to accept your generous proposals i cannot say that i feel at all worthy of the distinction of being selected from among so many fauer more gifted and more richly endowed in every way to be the partner of your fortune and the mistress of your establishment but i shall feel proud to be the wife of one so good and noble and henceforth my chief study will be to make myself worthy of the honour you have done me had mr addington been more experienced in womankind he would have known that this kind fluent and amiable language was not that of a fond weak womans heart but of a clever womans head there was none of the faltering confusion the fascinating tautology the fearful joythe fear the shame the bliss almost painful in its intensity the thoughts too deep for utterance the feelings all too delicate for words mr addington was far too much in love all banker as he was to have a notion at that moment except of his own rapture and his brides condescension he tried to take the hand she extended to him he tried to speak his gratitude but he was far too much overcome for eloquence and so after exclaiming  oh miss ashton iyouall the honourforgive me i have loved you so longin secretso very long so very fondlyiii he hastily took out his handkerchief buried his face in it and burst into tears penelope felt very uncomfortabletouched she certainly wasbut ashamed too of feeling so little when the man she had accepted as a husband felt so much with his handkerchief still to his face he rose and went to the window and for some minutes penelope could see by the heaving of his breast as she stole a view of him en profile that ho was mastering great emotion  he is to be my husband she thought and therefore i must act as if i loved him and perhaps what is at first assumed may become real ah how would it be if oh bernard but i must not will not be so weak so wicked alas i will give my heart with my hand at least i will so strive to do so that i shall not seem a hypocriteto my god addingtons fortune exceeds 7000 ayear half of which he professes himself ready to setttle on the  bride elect together with ijooo per annum pinmoney miss ashton in her new character receives an invitation to pass a few weeks with the mother of her  futur a pragmatical disagreeable rheumatic old woman whose thoughts and affections are entirely centred in her son during her stay at addington lodge a few miles from brighton penelope discovers that bernard brydges between whom and herself all communication has recently ceased is residing at brighton she contrives and obtains more than one interview with the man who still holds undivided possession of her heart hoping that she may yet induce him to aid her in escaping from a fate in spite of its brilliancy becoming more odious the nearer it approaches she could bear that bernard should know she was going to marry mr addington she could not endure the thought that he should fancy she loved him she wished to be embalmed in his memory as a victim she could not tolerate the thought of figuring there as the contented prosperous affectionate wife of a middleaged banker and yet how could she undeceive him  had he not seen her weeping by mr addingtons side his arm round her waist her head on his shoulder what agony she felt at the idea that he would never believe that she had sacrificed herself it soon transpires however that brydges real object in haunting the same part of the country as his poor inamorata is not alas his love for her but a strong affection he has lately conceived for the shekels of miss addington a spinster of mature age frivolous disposition and very small personal attractions but with a reputed fortune of 70000 he contrives to obtain an introduction to the mother and an invitation to the same house in which penelope is staying poor miss ashton suddenly misinterprets the vile deceivers motives one day looking from her window mistaken motives she saw dora ridiculously overdressed and assuming the most jaunty coquetry of manner sporting about the lawn and along the shrubberies with bernard brydges she was followed by a little snowwhite french poodle that penelope had never seen before and which lier jealous heart suggested bernard had perhaps given but as she dressed herself in a new and elegant costume and as the glass reflected her cheeks hushed with emotion her eyes tull of passionate fire her form so proud and so perfect and the beauty over which love shed a lustre love alone can shed she contrasted her own exquisite grace and beauty with the little unshapen form gaudy attire sandy hair weak eyes and quaint absurdity of the figure ambling by bernards side and she felt ashamed of her own momentary jealousy had she in weighing herself and dora in the scale just put in seventy thousand pounds on doras sidethat sum in which bernard brydges whole soul is in reality wrapped uphow different would her deduction have been  poor dear bernard how he must love me to tolerate her and her odious advancesmiserable attempt at coquetry and wearisome affectations for my sake but ai in my side wlat nave  not entlureu tor him alas alas how is it all to end i must understand ms scheme i cannot play this part much longer but at auy rate i must be all kindness tonight for what a penance has he not endured for rae today various notes are interchanged penelope being eager to fathom brydges meaning while he is only anxious to lull her suspicions till he can elope with the  fortune that has awakened his cupidity one of these epistles to bernard brydges in penelopes hand is at last discovered and causes a frightful catastrophe the unlucky missive insisted on a meeting and an explanation early the following morning miss ashton appointed the place and she had determined to impart to her quondam admirer her resolution to break off the match with mr addington and to insist on bernards leaving her for ever unless he chose to accept the sacrifice she was so eager to make and to elope with her himself bernard brydges had however arranged a meeting of much more importance in his eyes mr addington and his mother came to the trysting place instead the eclaircis9ement it was a summerhouse that overlooked the road to london she waited for some time in miserable anxiety and impatience and bernard brydges did not come she began to fear he had deceived her burning shame dyed her cheeks anger and despair lighted her eyes and fired her breast she was about to leave the spot when the sound of carriagewheels in though road beneath attracted her attention  a postchaise and four dashed by the blinds were drawn down but one was suddenly raised and the face of dora looked up at the summerhouse yes dora waved her hand triumphantly to the bride elect bernard brydges shrank back in the carriage and hastily pulled down the blind penelope did not see his face but she did see his hand his white kid glove proclaiming the bridegroom oh there was not a doubt not a miserable doubt left he had been trifling with her keeping her quiet making a tool of her his sole object being that miserable halfwitted heiressno no there could be no doubt hannah is in the rumble with some jeering valet and both look up aud both laugh yes she sees them both laugh as fixed like a statue of despair her hair streaming in the damp morning air her form rigid her lips ana cheeks marblewhite and her hands tightly pressed upon her tortured bosom she stands at the entrance of that bower still looking wildly after the carriage and four round which rise such clouds of dustemblems as bernard thinks and whispers to the enraptured dora of what he would compel her brother to come down with slowly penelope turns with shivering horror and prepares to leave the spot as she does so she utters a faint cry for the first objects that meet her eye are mr addington and his mother she sees in a moment that they know all he is ghastly pale but stern and haughty and in his just indignation he looks almost dignified in his hands he holdsoh god yes it is her own note he held it out to her she tried to take it but a sharp cry burst from her lips her eyes flashed wildly all her features worked her limbs became convulsed she attempted to speak but could not articulate presently her knees shook her arms dropped and she fell heavily on the ground mr and mrs addington looked at each other they knew not what to do  do not touch her do not condescend to touch her reptile that she is said mrs addington  i will go and send some of the servants to carry her not to our house i but to the  no no mother in this statecruel treacherous aud base as she has beeni cannot leave her and remember we have had no explanation of her wishing to meet him you wronged her cruelly once dear mother how can we tell what account she may bc able to give of this mystery  ah my poor poor george it was conscience that smote her to the ground when she saw you she was there to meet him she saw him as we did wretch fortunehunter beggar that he ls elope with your poor deceived unhappy sister she was about to return brokenhearted no doubt but ready to bestow that broken heart on you when the sight of ber own vile note iu your hand overcame even her treachery her imprudence and her own conscienco struck her down at your feet this is the true state of the case my poor poor boy and you have only to thank heaven for an escape which to me seems like a miracle vouchsafed to save you the poor girl after a terrible illness recovers her health but her reason has fled for ever brydges finds that his wifes fortune is notas lu fondly anticipated at her sole disposal but entirely dependent on the will of her brother who generously allows the newlymarried couple 2007 a month to be paid to her so long as they lived happily together but to be paid to her alone if a separation should at any time take place between them we shall leave our readers to discover for themselves the histories of isabel and blanche together with the fate of their two graceless lovers merely adding that the respectable banker unites himself and his fortune to the amiable daughter of a poor clergyman the poor girl having long secretly entertained a passion for him the nnovel is written in an amusing style though here and there we detect errors not unfrequent in works of the class to which this pertains the more prominent attributes of the male characters in order that they may appear more striking are overdrawn and the language they are now and then made to utter is such as could never in reality have been used by gentlemen imagine for a moment any oxford man above the rank of a college  scout accosting the young lady to whom he is presumed to be paying his addresses in such insulting words as these  i say blanche whats the matter with pen  has bernard brydges moved off and has the old lady been kicking up a shindy  i could have told them bernard was no go ihe s not made for double harness and with all his pretence of love and sentiment tin is his idol and by jove he s righttake my word for it such expressions would hardly be tolerated in the servants hall at any rate no lady with english blood in her veins would ever admit a second time to her boudoir a brute who could demean himself thus grossly we might quote several other passages of a similar character but we shall content ourselves with one it is an extract from a letter of the same oxford man 441 say old boy dont you wish she may get it the old cat keeps aloof and lets me do much as i like with her pretty and playful little kitten shethe old pussis lpatle dc velours now but i suspect no mouse ever had a sharper run for bis life than i shall have for my liberty when she discovers that i dont mean to let her and her daughter  walk into nie and my good living what fangs and claws then old boy wont it be glorious sport  there are however other perhaps somewhat more venial errors which should also be sedulously avoided on future occasions since they can only be attributable to the ignorance of the writer or the carelessness of the printers  reader the authoress in her dedication to her brother professes  a truly feminine reverence for his finished scholarship c c we think it would not be amiss were she the next time she publishes to submit her proofsheets to that gentlemans critical eye her readers then would probably be spared such sad blunders as these  it was pain to give you up but to give up stultz hoby verey et cetera omnibus  would be greater pain still  bernard brydges possessed all the minor virtues in perfection punctuality politeness neatness order cleanliness et cetera paribus   lamour est comme la petite verole qui fait dautant plus de mal quih vous prend tara by the way in almost every french quotation of which there are not a few the words are grossly misspelt and the accent is either omitted or wrongly placed as in the one just cited tete a tete is repeatedly spelled tete a tete menus ansirsmemtsplaisirs billets dmxbillet doux cestettunpartimagnifique forcetait c again we are informed that a young lady is cured of squinting  by the operation  called strabismusoften a failure but in this instance perfectly successful  strabismus being in fact the technical term for the deformity not the remedy the cure too it seems was accomplished by a very clever italian occulist sic in like manner irate is spelled once or twice irrate nil admirari is rendered  nil admirare c captain beresford we are repeatedly told is a comet in the dragoon guards how are we to reconcile this anomaly  however notwithstanding numerous similar errors the intention of the writer is evidently pure and good which is of itself sufficient to redeem a host of faults we trust that the sad fate of the  bride elect may serve to guard many a warm and unsuspecting english heart against such vain delusive triflers as the  men of unmeaning attentions  here so justly denounced,novel
1 abots cleve or can it be proved a norel  new nnovels 3 vols tinsley brothersit is very seldom that a nnovel from a new hand is so free from marks of inexperience as  abbots cleve yet we must suppose it to be a first effort since it displays neither an authors name nor a list of former works on the titlepage we hope most sincerely that the author will not like many young writtrs of the day fall into the mistake of issuing a fresh nnovel every three months but will bestow on each subsequent production the same amount of careful industry which is conspicuous in the present work we are induced t offer this warning from a consideration of the worthlessness of the machinemade stories of several authors who started with no inconsiderable promise two or three years ago the author of abbots cleve is too good a writer to be lost in this way  his maiden work is calculated to raise expectation to a high pitch and we trust that he will not disappoint the reading public hereafter the heroine of the story florence cleve makes her first appearance at a snug little suburban residence where mrs thornleigh a friend of her deceased fathers family has educated her with her own daughter kate but although she is thus humbly brought up florence is heir presumptive to a splendid estate in    shire which is to come to her in case the present owner her cousin augusta dies without children shortly after the opening of the story florence is invited to take up her abode with her cousin  and she feels a pardonable pride on entering the home of her fathers though she enters it only as a poor relation the master of the house is count almonti an italian nobleman with innumerable quarterings but infinitesimal estates who has married partly for love and partly fur money but has found to his bitter disappointment that neither augustas love nor her money can ever be his  augusta has in fact long since given her heart to eustace vaughan a young man of good but rather remote expectations whom her deceased mother bent upon her acquiring a title has not allowed herto marry in short the foolish motherhns preferred a penniless count to a penniless english gentleman so the italian has married a woman who cares nothing for him aud whom he very soon finds to be devoted to another about this time florence comes to live at abbots cleve and finds her foreign cousin courteous smiling and goodhumoured she knows nothinp of his grievances  to bis wife as to all he is kind and attentive while the countess on the other hand is vain illtemjiered and capricious who would suspect that the latter was marked down as a victim and that her mild and polished husband was to be the assassin after a time augusta falls ill and is confined to her bed  she becomes nervous and weak and reveals to florence a notion which seems absurd and fanciful namely that some mysterious being steals into her room and hovers about her sick bed at dead of night she implores her young cousin to bide herself in a dressingroom hard by and to remain there all night and see what happens it is thus that florence learns the guilt of the count and it is thus also that she herself being seen by an earlyrising servant to handle the medicinebottles and then to leave the room hurriedly is believed by him to have poisoned the countess for the sake of her rich inheritance this servant mat turner becomes the tyrant of her life the worst point being that he is not a mere conspirator but one who fully and honestly believes her to be a murderess appearances being in fact very much against her and her explanation being so extraordinary as to seem quite incredible the count loses house lands and position by the death of his wife while florence gains all three by the same event and she bees therefore with bitter regret how difficult it would be to make her story believed and consents to purchase by money and other favours the silence of the surly domestic the miseries arising from this concealment can only be briefly described here florence is married to her devoted lover bernard thornleigh and for a short time she forgets her apprehensions of discovery in the happiness of wedded life but the insolence and illtemper of turner soon put an end to the pleasant daydream as bernards suspicions are aroused and by degrees he loses all confidence in his wife at last he forces the secret from turner and already predisposed against florence he believes her to be guilty of the dreadful crime of which she is accused henceforth he cannot bear her presence and he leaves home and fortune to begin life over again in a distant clime nothing at this stage can seem more hopeless than the position of affairs luckily however there is a resolute young lady named kate thornleigh who is excessively indignant at all this and believes every word of the story which poor florence is at last induced to tell her now the imperious kate has a very obedient lover one richard austin who is rich in money but humble in mind and who wor ships the penniless kate with an ardour which makes him ready to attempt impossibilities at her command this devoted man is very curtly informed that he can never hope to marry his adored one unless he succeeds in sifting out everything and clearing florences character the only way to effect this is to force a full confession from the count who has long since disappeared and as it must all be done secretly so as not to bring before the world the fearfully suspicious circumstances involved in florences own account of the matter it requires no little ingenuity to devise a plan by which it may be brought about the author deserves much praise for the skill with which this portion of the book is managed the chain of evidence is so nnovel and striking that the mind is kept in constant surprise and expectation yet the links are so neatly fitted together that it would be difficult to find a flaw or hitch in it to give the details of richards plans would be to destroy the readers pleasure in watching their gradual development but we may venture to mention that after much anxiety he is proudly triumphant at last and extorts a full confession a la fosco from the double murderer of vaughan and augusta the feature of a written confession extracted from an italian count must of course remind every reader of the woman in white but count almonti is a very different character from count fosco his object is not plunder but the preservation of his family honour which he considers would be destroyed by a suit in the divorce court but will survive any number of secret murders he is a criminal of course but not a criminal of a vulgar type and in his own eyes perhaps not a criminal at all his error does not lie in cupidity or unkindness and although certainly a man of deep prejudices and apparently an unbeliever he would probably be dangerous to none but his enemies the other characters are very well drawn each being stamped with a clear individuality the dignified kate awes down her timid lover by a selfpossession not unmixed with severity yet she nearly loses the game by exposing her hand to almonti and then for the first time she begins to respect richard for the plain commonsense in which he is clearly her superior as the plot goes on she appreciates more and more his merit and devotion and when at last he obtains singlehanded the victory which he has nearly missed through her impetuosity she ceases to despise him for his excessive modesty and recognises him cordially as the lord and master of her fate the minor characters are well fitted in to their subordinate places and some of them show a good deal of dry humour it is some time since we have seen a nnovel equal to abbots cleve in the several requisites of variety of character completeness of mechanism vigour and correctness of language and sustained and legitimate interest,novel

american wives and english husbands the title of the bigger book covers the main incident of the lesser but 1 his fortunate grace is evidently not a study for nor a pendent to  american wives and english husbands the scene of the shorter story is laid in new york and mostly among easterners whom we gather mrs atherton does not like and whose vices and weaknesses she presents let us hope slanderously she speaks for the american of the south and the west and is almost as sensitive over the european lumping of the new world racial differences as a scot when he is looked on as a mere englishman the passages in the history of miss augusta forbes heiress to millions are presented to show how coldblooded businesslike and determined a young new york maiden can be in her pursuit of social position in englahd true the heiresss mother a southerner is nearly as keen in the matter but she is otherwise an agreeable and very affectionate person the longer book is a lovestory the villainess is an american to be sure raised in chicago but though she is powerful enough to bring on the catastrophe she cannot divert our attention from the heroine lee the western beauty and not too much of an heiress for lee let us be grateful since she means a much pleasanter atmosphere than can be breathed in any other of the books of this talented writer not too much of an heiress we have said but mrs athertons heroines demand a thick luxury for their graces and forces to develop in patience sparhawk and lee both know hardship in their childhood but that poverty can mean anything but starvation of the mind the soul the senses never seems to occur to this observer of life and lee is rescued from it at the age of eleven that her conquest of the highest circles may be assured we like

she can be generous helpful and a charming comrade but the externals of life are real and even solemn to her in a degree that surprises old democratic europe it is more profitable to regard her not in

but admiration for it it is well writtenthere are few such slips as h he would have gone down as others of his gilded ilk had gone down there is real observation and there is sympathy in it while the

wives and english husbands reviews by gertrude atherton service  paton this is a stronger piece of work than his fortunate grace more ambitious and achieving more the somewhat clumsy title strikes a keynote this story like the last deals with the theory or practice of angloamerican intermarriage mrs atherton would protest one gathers against the blunt judgement which lumps all american wives into a single unflattering category after all she points out to us there is a world of difference between say your raw western heiress and the southern woman of good californian family with a century or two of delicate breeding behind her the former does not beseem a coronet the latter may meet an english noble with a pride of race equal to his own such a one is lee tarlton mrs athertons heroine her personality dominates the book she is well conceived and thoroughly alive we rejoice that she is beautiful for heroines with lank drab hair and squat figures pall on the reviewer but when to beauty she adds brains courage and a high sense of honour we feel that lord maundrell is a lucky man he too is well drawn though with a touch of transatlantic scorn for the impressive  set englishman the plot is not much the interest centres in lees development as a calif orman girl and an english bride over against her is set her husbands stepmother also an american of rank extraction who brings lord barnstaples fortune and good name to ruin he learns at last that the expenses of maundrell abbey are being paid out of her lovers purse and a strong scene between him and the truehearted lee follows  he was sitting at his desk writing and as he lifted his hand at her abrupt entrance and laid it on an object beside his papers she received no shock of surprise she went forward and lifted his hand from the revolver  must you p she asked  of course i must do you think i could live with myself another day  perhaps no one need ever know  everybody in england will know before a week is over she gave me to understand that people guessed it already  this seems such a terrible alternative to a womanbut  but you have race in you you understand perfectly my honour has been sold and my pride is dead there is no place among men for what is left of me and to face my son again good god  can nothing be done to keep it from cecil p  nothing it is the only heritage i leave him and hell have to stand it as best he can it wont kill him nor his courage hes made of stronger stuff than that and if ive brought the family honour to the dust he has it in him to raise it higher than it has ever been never let him forget that youve played your part well all along but youve a great deal more to do yet youll find that fate didnt steer you into this family to play the pretty role of countess    i am equal to my part  yes i think you are now i have an hours work before me i cant let you go till ive finished you are a strong creaturebut you are a woman all the same you must stay here until i am ready to let you go 11 want to stay with you  thank you sit down he handed her a chair and returned to his writing lord barnstable laid down his pen and sealed his letters he stood up and held out his hand  goodbye he said they shook hands closely and in silence then she went out and he closed the door behind her she stood still waiting for the signal she could not carry the news of his death to his son until he was gone beyond the shadow of a doubt it was so long coming that she wondered if his courage had failed him or if he were praying before the picture of his wife it came at last lord barnstable dies but the atmosphere remains electric we somehow expect that lord maundrell will follow in his fathers footsteps and that lee will fall into the hands of a magerful compatriot who has

the story of siephen compton by j e patterson 6s heinemann in his new nnovel  the story of stephen compton mr j e patterson shows an advance of importance in his art he began by aiming at producing an impression of power and in such nnovels as  fishers of the sea he certainly succeeded in his aim but the undoubted power of his writing was purchased at the expense of other qualities which are more valuable in literature he resembled those sculptors of the sixteenth century who sacrificed everything to the effect of strength and in search of an impression of elemental force exaggerated the muscular lines of all their figures hic saw life in a kind of white intensity from which was absent the sweetening individualising play of the softer lights and shadows cf human existence there was a lack of flexibility and variety in his way of writing it is heire that  the story of stephen compton  marks a development in his art the opening chapters of this political romance are as strong as anything that mr patterson has written some persons indeed may find them too xviolently frank for they depict with a sort of savage indignation the most unpleasant side of character of the heros very unpleasant brother in one way mr patterson is a writer of the realistic school for he resolutely paints the entire life of his characters stephen and his brother are portrayed with a daring intimacy that makes them uncommonly lifelike they are slum children in a lancashire spinning town and nothing is omitted in the picture of the mnserv and foulness ot their early circumstances but on thifoundation of realism mr patterson builds a fine thought full study of the nobler forces obscurely working in our industrial civilization they become incarnate in the manlier of the two l stephen wlho is merely strengtilenel and tninxtrel iw the ad erev t conditions ot his hit isle becomlive a o ialivt i the re duntwintr cl kd and k firebrand of lancashire and lie loses the girl he loves rather than give up his career as an agitator by sheer abilitv hie wins sufficient money at last to enter political life and growing aware of the practical value of a cultivated mind hie goes into the world of society in order to acquire the weapons of the enemy it is this part of mr pattersons work that delighted the present reviewer it is brilliant varied and lightened with touches of humour and wit a throng of diverse characters is brought upon the scene and handled easily and naturally and in a quiet subtle way the development of stephens character is portrayed without any apparent effort to portray it one merely sees him grow iip on arriving at his full stature he becomes a political force of a reconciling kind for while acquiring the weapons of the enemy he learns also to appreciate what is valid in their point of view so when he is made prime nlinister with an overwhelming xmajority of reformers inspired and directed by him he is able to reorganise the life of the country in such a way as to please both labour and capital,novel
new nnovels katharine frensham by beatrice harraden blackwood  sons a lasting affection for a story called  ships that pass in the night may be a readers misfortune but is certainly neither his nor miss harradens fault but it does obscure the merits of some of her other stories this one is a study in temperaments not altogether well realized we have a man afflicted with too tender a conscience too sensitive a nature and too slender a power of expression restored to happiness and a balanced mind through the sympathy and devotion of the woman who gives her name to the story thornton as he is called is a distinguished man of science though the true scientific attitude and nature do not seem well suggested an unsympathetic and exacting wife has from the outset of their union wrecked his peace of mind and his career and even helped to spoil the affectionate relations between the father and his boy thornton is represented as being of so unselfish and chivalrous a nature that he finds it impossible to take his courage in both hands and end this distressing tyranny but at length and on this everything is supposed to turn he in a dream in his study speaks his mind and she also in a dream in an upper chamber becomes suddenly conscious of the true state of his feelings towards her the horror of this telepathic revelation kills her the situation is not easy of acceptance apart from that its effect on the nature of such a woman as she is made out to be is rather incredible a somethiog farfetched and laboured about much of the plot and circumstance is a contrast to the air of spontaneity and ease of ships that pass in the night the influence of the good heroine almost immediately sets in but she is not permitted to restore the sufferer wholly till the end eemorse reserve and a poorly imagined female evil genius stand between the pair whose respective auras as we are told with wearisome frequency are an excellent match a want of simplicity and too much iteration in the dialogue and sentiment are very visible to like the perfect woman nobly planned before whom everybody in a book falls in worship is perhaps always a little difficult a great part of the action of the story passes in norway and so we get some pleasant descriptions of the manners and customs of the country a very vivacious old danish governess is much to the fore throughout  katharine frensham by beatrice harraden blackwood 6s preliminary paragraphs have made it clear to all men that miss harraden has spent considerable time in norway during the preparation of her new romance otherwise the reader might be tempted to suspect that she had put in her local colour from a volume of travels and a phrasebook surely an experienced author should be too wise to let her background transform itself into a foregroundr yet this is what occurs throughout the nnovel miss harraden cannot convince herself that close accounts of norwegian local customs do not conduce to the dramatic effect of a story which concerns itself after all with english people and that atmosphere is not to be conveyed by scraps of foreign dialogue with translations in brackets the human problem set forth in katharine frensham demands a treatment more profound and subtle than the author has accorded it in one of his strongest books william dean howells wrought out with relentless logic the effect produced on two sensitive natures by an imagined guilt and a haunting dream here the motive is similar clifford thornton cannot rid himself of the sense that he is guilty of his wifes death because in a dream he has uttered his longrepressed bitterness and she in a dream heard his arraignment peculiar insight and skill are needed for such a psychological problem but in  katharine frensham  it is comfortably clear all along that clifford is going to escape from the shadows which indeed are only there to emphasise the coming light the book is pleasantly written and  knutty the quizzical danish governess is an amusing acquaintance but though  katharine frensham  may be a cultured and pleasing story it is not life or in any true sense literature,novel
i my little girl a nnovel by the authors of  readymo mortiboy tinsley brothers  this nnovel maintains the high standard of the author former work it was evident to the readers of that tae that they would be likely to make progress in one of two directions that of an increase of romantic interest in the composition of the narrative or of a completer suborda tion of this element to the political and religion specs lations which found utterance in their former work though these are not wanting in the present nnovel which preserves the leading characteristic of the last reversee for true goodness and contempt for hypocrisy the advnce is mainly in the first direction the plot is original a might be expected and mainly hinges upon a very snmgular misunderstanding the position of the heroine  my little girl is an anomalous one she is the ward of a man who is not only unmarried but young enough to love her and to inspire a reciprocal attachment when the charming lollie is at last unmistakably grownup this fact of their mutual love is by no means clear to either party their relation has hitherto been that of tutor and pupil and no other has suggested itself to their minds hartley venn however now begins to have an uneasy sen sation that his ward had better be married and that of course he shall be glad to see her married the expression of this feeling on his part combined with the girls own unconsciousness of the real nature of her affection for her guardian produce a singular result the conversation in which after a consultation with his sister he propounds his plan for the happiness of his  little girl is worth quoting  and so after a long talk with my sister    she gave meo lollie the answer to the question i have been troubling myself with for so long she says my child that there is only one way you must be comfortably and honourably married her very words  i mr venn  the girl looked up and laughed in his face with those merry blue eyes of hers  what have i done that i must be married    doiit raise difficulties lollie he said in a feeble way after all the trouble we had in getting sukey to give us a right answer too   she laughed again i suppose i am not to be married unless i like why noi suppose not no oh certainly not but you will like wont you  and who am i to marry  why you see lollie he grew confidential  the fact is i dont know jones wont do    oh dear no he is tootooundignified mr lynn certainly not is there any one else  not at present my child but we shall see let us lok around us london is a great place if london wont do there is all england besides the rest of great britain berwickoftweed and the colonies after this expression of her guardians wishes regarding her settlement in life lollie falls in with the wicked hero  of the book philip durnford who eventually persuades her though she is not the least in love with him to run away with him as a pleasant surprise to the kiad guardian who was so anxious to see her married the unconscious lovemaking between hartley venn and his ward is so prettily described that this wild step of poor lollies is almost as great a shock to the reader as we may suppose it to have been to mr venn the marriage ia which  the little girl  has entangled herself is further a mock marriage devised by a very welldescribed and decidedly original character a drunken old scotch domifie who has  gone to the bad  with great energy and perseverance and employs himself in assisting philip durnford to take the downward course it would be unfair to eto the circumstances by which happiness is at last restored to mr venn and his too obedient pupil and our space does not permit us to notice the other interesting characters 1ad the bookarthur durnford his ladylove and philip durnfords erring but highminded mother they ar well worthy of a closer acquaintance and the various vicissitudes of their history and that of  my little gil form one of the most attractive stories that have sppyted this season aajy w   a d  i my little girl a nnovel by the authors of  ready money m ortiboy tinsley brothers there is decided originality in this work and on the whole it is very considerably above the average the interest howvever is less dependent on the story itself or the characters introduced than on certain adjunctsit might almost be said on the numerous digressionswhich though they may impede the course of the narrative certainly render the work what it is a production of marked power interest and individuality in a word the writers excel more in description than in the construction and elaboration of a plot less in telling a story or delineating character than in delineating certain phases of life and philosophising in a tone which if slightly cynical is indisputably fresh and suggestive the story opens effectively in the island of palmiste better known as prince georges island and after a few pages of brilliantlywritten descriptive matter we find ourselves transported to the estate of fontainebleau where george durnford an excavalry officer is discovered sorrowing for the early and sudden loss of his wife adrienne suddenly there appears on the scene a young mulatto woman marie wyname formerly durnfords mistress who having come for the purpose of triumphing over his sprrow ultimately relents and leaves the house with the intention of proceeding to europe where having a fine voice she purposes adopting the musical profession it is at this point that the story really commences the nnovel concerning itself for the most part with the fortunes of george durnfords two sons phil the illegitimate child of marie and arthur the heir to the estates an evil genius of a somewhat commonplace type is introduced in the form of a mr macintyre a scotch tutor who by means of forgery professes to establish phils legitimacy and amongst other villanies celebrates what is intended to be a mock marriage between his worthless protege and the  little girl lollie from whom the story derives its title phil durnford a black sheep first an officer in a line regiment then a gambler a  welsher and a drunkard ends his days in the island of palmiste to which he returns in desperation and where he dies in his mothers arms arthur a weak indecisive quixotic and rather colourless character falls under the imperious sway of madeleine de villeroy vwo born in the island of palmiste becomes on visiting england an enthusiast in the cause of the poor to whose relief and moral elevation she devotes herself body and soul the little girl though discarded by phil durnford who rudely tells her that she is only his mistress is eventually righted and on the whole the narrative is brought to a satisfactory con clusion undeniably there are dull pages in the book the meetings of the  chorus and jones nonsense verses for instance being far from interesting but broadly speaking the nnovel is one to be read and in spite of its somewhat unengaging characters and loosely constructed plot has the very decided merit of being written in a pure vigorous manly style the dialogue occasionally reaches to brilliancy there are bursts of true eloquence there are many descrip tive passages of great beauty there are some highly dramatic and effective situations the authors write from head and heart not ftop s memory stocked with other peoples ideas they have a command of genuinse pathos and it is hard to read such passages as those descriptive of lollies wanderings phils death and the shipwreck unmoved the language too is always goodterse vigorous and free from affectation and no fault can be found with the work on the score of its moral tone which is undeniably pure and elevated as we remarked before the strength of the collaborateurs seems to be in description rather than invention some of the incidents being forced and the characters acting at times in an unreal spasmodic fashion but the work displays considerable knowledge of life in its various phases and is most remarkable for its genuine literary and brain power earnestness and originality  my little girl is decidedly a remarkable production and as such wve commend it to the attention of readers who prefer something more bracing than the con ventional twaddle of the circulating library a peculiar feature of the book are the headings to the chapters often wooden and seldom very correctly drawn they have yet a subtle charm being full of grace quaint humour and delicate suggestiveness,novel

crimes whose natural element is in melodramas and french nnovels and whoso bodily sresentment may be seen at the port stlartin laurence carr of carrlyon the hero having seen gilda and fallen in love resolves after the fashion of young men who have been spoilt and who have never had occasion to deny themselves the indulgence of a single whim or emotion in the course of their lives to see more of her and casts about for means of becoming acquainted with the courtneys to this end he displays some ingenuity and by means of an accident created for the purpose by him he gets admitted into their domestic interior the play of the different characters is extremely well delineated mr courtney the father a coldmannered reserved highlybred english gentleman evidently in a wrong positionhis wife delicate sad blameless  but struggling with the influence of some past event which overshadows her life are both very cleverly drawn and give the impression of having been taken from the life the inci dents aro few the interest of the story turns entirely upon the action of the characters upon each other and the influence of their qualities upon the lives and fortunes of each other which is all very skilfully and truly managed carr becomes confirmed in his intention of proposing for gilda in spite of his ignorance of all her connexions and antecedents partly by the discovery of their sudden intention to quit bologna and partly by an illtimed and extremely detestable letter from his mother gilda might not have been likely to acquiesce in his intentions had not sara gisborne to get rid of her rival used all the treacherous and unscrupulous arts which black angels and demon heroines have used from time immemorial she persuades her that guido not only does not love her but that he avoids her hwing suspected her love for him and poor gilda who is guileless as a child recoils in trouble and dismay she works on guidos firide and sense of honour and tells him all the ies she thinks convenient she works artfully upon carr himself she discovers that she herself is the natural daughter of mr courtney and she obtains possession of the family secret of gildas parents this secret is quite dark enough to deter any man who did not love with a devotion and strength of character very rare in the world from seeking their daughter for a wife mrs courtney was a woman of high rank and had been the heroine of a terrible tragedy and cause celcbre she had eloped from her husband her lover had shot him dead in a duel and this was the reason why they were obliged to live in such profound seclusion under a false name gilda of course knows nothing of all this her mother is more than repentant if sorrow could efface crime her father dying of ennui and regret he is anxious to have his daughter married and though he would have preferred poor guido as the one who would have been less likely to be outraged by the knowledge of facts still as guido has drawn back carr cannot be called ineligible and mr courtney resolves to accept him his wife wishes the whole truth revealed courtney like a man decides that it is unnecessary he merely impresses on young carr that the intimacy and proposal had been of his own seeking all the parties act up to their own respective characters and the tragedy of the story results from the natural influence of some quality not exactly reprehensive or some other quality which like the sulphur and saltpetre in gunpowder are harmless until brought together when the result is at the mercy of a casual spark carr marries gilda who is a charming and adorable creature she has told him the truth about guido so far as she knows it herself and then she sets herself to efface the dream of the past and she succeeds it has often been remarked that the daughters of those women who have lapsed from virtue are brought up more carefully and sternly than the daughters of mothers who only know evil by hearsay and mrs courtney has expiated too bitterly the sin of her youth to have left gilda unguarded guido goes away to fight the battles of nis country but not before sara gisborne has made an avowal of her love and been refused in the most chivalrous but decided manner possible being a determined young woman she is not to be repulsed but bides her time and makes use of the knowledge she has obtained to wring terms from mr courtney who dies under the sudden shock of her threats and taunts following up her advantage she wrings from the widow nearly every farthing she possesses and then disguising herself as a boy she enlists as a recruit in the army of charles albert in the same regiment with guido mrs courtney left almost destitute has to accept a home with her daughter and then occurs one of the vital incidents of the story aud one which though possible is too exceptional to make it probable gilda and mrs courtney wish to visit the hospital where the wounded have been taken after the battle of novara carr unwillingly consentshe leaves his wife and mother to go inside and awaits them guido has been wounded and he is the tenant of the first bed they pass beside him sits sara gisborne gilda hears his ravings and recognises that he has always loved her and that sara has lied it is too late now and the pure womanly way in which she clings to the husband she has taken shutting out all regret or thought of the past is very delicately drawn and is charming unfortunately carr hears accidentally that guido is in thc hospital appearances are against gilda but this time her perfect truth and frankness disarm his suspicious nature but the first grain of sand has been thrown in to trouble the waters carrs mother comes to visit them and the mischief and discomfort from the incompatible natures of all the parties are very true to life in the midst of this the malignant jealousy of sara gisborne comes in maddened that gilda has heard the truth of guidos love for her she writes to carrs mother the family secret connected with her sons wife this is well managed the reader is never bewildered into palliating the guilt of the unhappy mother but the sympathy and pity that are roused are none the less strong the interview between carr and mrs courtney is the most powerful scene in the book the secret is kept from gilda but the evil influence it exercises cannot be averted her husband loves her but he cannot forget the blood that she inherits and doubts whether the evil principle has not been entailed upon her along with it and he never really trusts her afterwards sara disappears and leads a life of more than questionable repute till she marries an old mau who is a duke leaving her a widow under some suspicion but she has become rich fashionable and a lionne in society watching over guido in the distance and still biding her time guido poor fellow gets into the way of starvation and in a not very probable or possible way becomes again mixed up with gilda and her husband and again rouses the latent jealousy of carr which has never been quite extinguished gilda has no suspicion of the web of false appearances and false inferences to which her innocent and natural conduct towards guido gives rise it is the curse of her parents sin that is working upon her the working up of the dinotimenl is very interesting but not very probable but the reader will not stop to be critical poetical justice is executed on sara gisborne and laurence carr is left at the end a sadder and a better man than he ever had been before this nnovel is of a higher class and of greater power than the general run of nnovels we have indicated the main incidents but it is in the working out of the details that the skill of the author is most shown,novel
the heritage of unrest by gwendolen overton 6s mlacmillan co this is at once good as a tale of adventure and unusually good as a study of the struggle between civilisation and wild nature of racial features and difficulties the strife with the indians with all its unhappy incidents on both sides its tales of treachery and heroism is made tragically real to us in a series of striking pictures and narratives of the war of thirty years ago the strange apaches valiant incalculable terrible and the american soldiers sent to conquer them with ever disadvantage ignorant of the country hampered by officialism and insufficiently armed are alike done justice to but the main interest of the book is the halfbreed feipa beautiful faithful to her friends knowing no duties to her enemies savagely cruel to animals and yet most devoted of wives miss overton has tested our credibility in her heroine but we believe and are fascinated  thc heritage of unrest new nnovels by gwendolen overton macmillan  co tue story of felipa who through her strain of indian blood is never quite at home in the civilised surroundings even of frontier life in a regiment is picturesque and tragic enough to redeem a worsetold story of what is generally the monotonous sordidness of americanindian warfare in miss overtons pages we see the better side of such warfare from the whites point of view though gruesome massacres and the shameful corruption and maladministration of the indian agencies alternately disgust the reader the character of landor the us officer who accepts felipa as his ward at the dying request of her father his comrade and with every good intention marries her as the best form of protection is a singlehearted and noble one cairness the wandering englishman from australia with a touch of convict blood has a more natural attraction for the child of the prairie her relations with these two run through the story as a filament on which are strung many and diverse incidents and the result is more instinct with human interest and richer in variety of type than most things we can remember of late years which can be assigned to the same historical category the strong relief of genuine humour too as in the quaint wooing of the missionary and his bride contributes to the humanity of the book,novel
the ctip and the lip by lauija jinvry author of the forest and the fortress c in 3 vols london newby miss jrwrynsforte is in descriipon she paints with a pencil full of colour bringing before us most vividly the scenes and persons she desires to introduce to us her command of language is great and she writes with ease and elegance she is most defective in dialogue and from the same cause her wealth of words is here a hindrance rather than a help for it leads her to make her personages speak more after her manner than according to their own individualities so like are their talkings that but for the name it would be impossible to say who was speaking and but for the description what were the characteristics of the speaker this is not an uncommon defect in nnovelists and indeed there are few who can thoroughly accomplish that highest art of fiction in which it is allied to the drama and by which every speech put into the mouth of every personage however insignificant has an identity with him insomuch that upon reading it there needs no repetition of the name to enable a person acquainted with the story to say who is the speaker the same faculty it is which enables the nnovelist to construct original characters it has been supposed by some that the art of fiction consists in making faithful copies of living originals it is not so the suggestion of a character may be taken from the life but imagination will always be required to be called in to mould and modify it to a shape that will serve the purposes of the fiction in the cup and the lip miss jevry maintains the reputation she has acquired by her former nnovels it is perhaps the most interesting of the series in its story and it exhibits signs of progress a more experienced hand is visible aul there is more of selfreliance she copies more from nature and less from models if she continues to take the same pains with herself and never to be satisfied with what she hae done but resolving to do better still she will secure a very high place among the nnovelists of our time,novel

llovct votes by bread alone by i k friedman 6s heine mann the vogue of the nnovel that substitutes a commercial interest for a love interest seems to be increasing but except in strong and skilful hands it is not a change for the better the liberal business element in by bread alone is however wisely leavened with such oderfashioned ingredients as the love of blair carrhart for evangeline marvin and the unsloken love of martha judson for blair to say nothing of characteristic wooings of minor persons of the sorv blair is a selfconfident young man who is regarded by his friends as eccentric or original he goes his own way solving the problems of humanity for himself regardless of the experience of others after a false start or two he gives the rein to his socialistic inclinations declines nartnershin in his fathers business renounces the girl he loves lest love should hamper him in the fulfilment of his mission and goes unknown as a common worker in the gigantic iron foundry of which evangelines father is the chief proprietor pitying the squalid lives of his companions a realistically individualised crew of germans italians poles swiss americans and horrified by the daily disasters and callous loss of life in the iron mills he endeavours to stir the men to a sense of what is due to them and to inoculate them with his socialistic ideals his benevolent teachings and the more fiery gospels of an anarchist group that has sprung up in this s warming industrial centre precipitate a strike powerless to rule the spirit he has helped to raise and too courageous to desert them blair throws in his lo with the strikers hoping to curl their excesses the mills are wrecked police and military are called out there is fighting and bloodshed and failure with a prospect of starvation and punishment and misery for those who have failed wounded in the rioting blair is nursed by evangeline who comes to him in defiance of her father he recovers disillusioned and blaming himself for the sufferings of his late comrades he abandons his ideals and contented with the love of evangeline returns to the conventional existence to which his father had long been hoping he would settle down the story is prodigal of exciting episodes and dramatic situations and contains some brilliant descriptive writing and though lacking condensation in parts is in the main a forceful and effective production,novel
  kent fort manor i by william henry bab fi cock philadelphia coates it is impossible to read mr babcocks book without seeing that he is a person of superior abilities one who has read much and has preserved the power of thinking for himself in  kent fort manor he has been interested in working out in the action of a story what he calls the hypothesis of inherited memory he expresses some fear for the success of this piece of mysterious machinery forgetting perhaps that the reader of nnovels cares nothing and ought to care nothing for the truth of such a hypothesis if it helps to make a good story it is acceptable but it will not of itself make a poor story into a good one unfortunately mr babcocks gifts do not lie in the art of narration he takes the period of the great civil war and one might think it would be difficult to fail in making something readable with such opportunities as the war presents to an american writer but kent fort manor is hard to read one cannot feel that interest in the principal characters which alone can make one pursue a story with pleasure the hypothesis of inherited memory does not appreciably add to ones burden but it fails to illuminate the obscure construction of a story which is wanting in the first essential of the nnovelists craft,novel
  the mistress of brae farm by rosa nouchette carey bentley  son this is a very long nnovel although it is in one volume the story so far as regards the plot and action is exceedingly simple but the details are multitudinous in the first hundred pages about a quarter of the book not fewer than three dozen persons are mentioned besides horses donkeys dogs and cats as the tale progresses fresh characters appear and the difficulty of remembering who is who becomes intolerable that the plot consists in col trevors falling gradually into an engagement with one woman and in love with another and then getting extricated is obvious at a very early stage so that the interest of the book is not strong it would however be unfair to omit to say that the author shows a great knowledge of village life and of the smaller squirearchy the nnovel is of an oldfashioned kind full of excellent sentiments and absolutely safe,novel

anne hereford whatever may have been said in dispraise of the hoational school of nnovelist at any rate it is something to indl book the three volumes of which can be read not only without weariuesa and disgust but with positive interest and ply  anne heetd a hotel by xm hemly wool 2 b a mrs henry wood is not a great nnovelist nor is she in any sense a great artist but she has in a high degree the power of storytelling as a rule the difficulties into which the dramiatis personae of her nnovels get are so gratuitously unnecessary and the ease by which a word on their part would extricate them from their troubles so apparent that the reader loses all belief in the reality of the incident and is simply annoyed at the stupidity of the hero and heroine there is too a want of truth in the minute details which is never found in a really highclass nnovel when we read for instance that the stolen will was written on parchment all belief in the will and in the theft departs the reader knows as a matter of fact that wills are not made on parchments and one little slip destroys all illusion in a moment mrs henry wood probably has never made her will and knows nothing of such matters nor is a woman supposed to know anything of them but then she should not write about them or she should get her ms revised by some one of wider experience than herself there is one svbject however of which mrs henry wood ought to know something and that is the character of women with a certain type of woman mrs henry wood seems to be familiar it is not a high type certainlybut one rather weakminded gossiping and decidedly vulgar sometimes the authoress appears to have a painful doubt whether her heroine is a wellbred gentlewoman or a lady as mrs henry wood and the servantmaids would say and then she is obliged to tell her readers in so many words that her heroine is a lady and many times has that assurance to be reiterated in the course of the book unhappily with little effect upon the mind of the reader whatever comfort it may bring to the authoress anne hereford the heroine introduces herself to us as a child of eleven years old 1 a thoughtful gentle child with a smooth pale forehead earnest eyes and long dark eyelashes that swept her cheek george eliot has told us that long eyelashes are not necessarily indicative of high moral qualities so anne herefords eyes and eyelashes seem to have meant nothing in particular there was one thing about her that had a decided value she was a  carew of keppecarew this was the gorgons head before which her enemies fell prostrate however lowly miss herefords position at any time she had but to unveil the awful keppecarew genealogy and her triumph was instantaneous the carews of keppecarew had under some inscrutable dispensation of providence been suffered to degenerate into the female line and the three daughters of the last of the carevrs were somewhat unfortunate in their matrimonial relationsbips there was mrs hereford the mother of the heroine who had married an officer without money and who died a widow leaving anne unprovided for and in the charge of her sister mrs edwin barley this lady had married mr edwin barley for his money and being young and goodlooking while her husband was elderly and ngly she amused herself by strong flirtations with her husbands ward philip king and with her guest george heneage all these people are incessantly acting as spies upon one anotherphilip king jealously watching george heneage and mr edwin barley leaving his shooting parties to spy upon both while anne hereford is generally behind a curtain or a tree watching the whole of this agreeable household the result of a system of espionage conducted by men with guns in their hands is that philip king is shot dead in the park close to anne herefords feet george heneage and mr edwin barley both appearing with their guns coming from the direction from which the shot was fired as mr edwin barley comes into a large fortune by the death of his ward and as he was a man with an overwhelming love of money the reader is left in doubt which of the two fired the fatal shot however heneage disappears and is pursued with unrelenting vindictiveness by mr barley mrs barley rushing out in the night air in her evening dress to find heneage caught what is vulgarly called her death of cold but nmakes unknown to her husband a will leaving her fortune to anne hereford mr barleys housekeeper in her zeal for her master finds the will on the night of mrs barleys death and destroys it the will having disappeared mr barley refuses to provide for anne hereford who goes to a school in paris and meets therea miss ohandos among the pupils this young lady runs away from ute schooi and marries a mr alfred de melise much to the disgust of her distinguished mother lady chandos madame de meliuse who is rather flighty soon tyres of her equally fighty husband and then begs to return to the amcestral home of chandos for a visit of indefinite length monsieur reluctantly consents on condition that his wife takes anne hereford as a companion on arriving at cbandos house it is clear that anne is de trod and that a mystery hangs over the mansion which is shut in by trees and carefully kept from the view of strangers of course the mystery is that george heneage alias george chandos the supposed murderer of philip king and a son of lady chandos is concealed in the house this concealment affords miss hereford abundant opportunity for exercising he peeping propensities an opportunity which she does not neglect and thereby occasions considerable uneasiness to the other son of lady chandos usually called mr chandos with whom anne falls in love the exercise of the affections of course causes the young lady to grow sentimental and talk of skies and trees and clouds and dying and accordingly we have the following new and beautiful sentiment the morning lad been very lnovely the evening was setting in less so a sighing wind whistled amidst the trees clouds passed rapidly over the faca of the sky and the autumn leaves fell and were whirled about the paths did it ever strike you that there is some thing melancholy in these dying leaves p many people like autumn best of the fbur seasons but i think there is in it a great deal of fadress it brings our own autumn of life too forcibly to the mind as though leaves of the trees decay and fall and die so must we when our time shall come but the indefatigable mr edwin barley is on the watch for his victim and takes a house close to the park gates that he may the more easily discover the whereabouts of george chandos who is in the mean time closely shut up in a wing of the house dying of consumption a few hours after his death mr barley succeeds in his quest only to find that his vengeance has been defeated and that george chandos who shot philip king half by accident and half by design is out of the reach of human justice mlr chandos becomes sir harry chandos and marries anne hereford who receives her aunts fortune from the repentant edwin barley so that everything is made pleasant and comfortable in the end as we have said the story is very readable and there are occasional gleams of humour take the following george chandos has ventured to take a walk by night among the trees of the park and has been seen and taken for a ghost by the servants  but the thing is incredible persisted harriet  let us suppose for arguments sake that it is mr chandoes ghost that walks what does it come for lizzie dene    i never heard

altiora peto literature by laurence oliphant 4 parts blackwood  sons ix altiora peto as in piccadilly mr oliphant presents himself to the nnovelreading world as one made up of equal parts of theosophist and social cynic mystic and man of the world the student of earthly character and manners and the student of divine mysteries he has an abundance of wit great knowledge of men and women and society and as much of though satirical habitthe tendency to attack with laughter and to make unpleasant or improper things ridiculousas any one since lord beaconsfield and to these qualities he adds an interest in the spiritual and a conviction as to its adaptability to purposes of fiction only to be paralleled in the work of professional preachers like dr george mac donald to the unregenerate eye in fact he presents a set of contradictions a confusion of contrasts at once amusing and respectable he appears as a kind of latterday apostle with a patmos of his own somewhere in pall mall and a peculiar wilderness in the very shadow of decimus burtons arch in one chapter the reader recognises him for the founder and editor of the most elegant and scholarly of satirical prints in another for the evangelist of anew a westend messiah he reminds you of blougram and of gigadibs in turn like the bishop he is an adept in balzac  the new edition fifty volumes long and like the literary man lie has long since tested his first plough and studied his last chapter of st john we prefer him as the bishop so to speak  for as it seems to us he is apt as gigadibs to be a trifle vague and transcendental he discourses of society with an ease a grace and an authority which are really admirable in  expounding of mysteries in treating of psychical revolutions and spiritual ambitions and successes he is far less successful in the one part of his tfork he is found to know exactly what to say and exactly how to say it in the other it is clear that if his convictions are complete he has not yet discovered bow completely to express them  that though ho ffiay well have made up his mind as to what he may with propriety declare he is a little ten in to th thi pei uneasy as to the terms and the effects of his declaration they will know what we mean who have read the brilliant and delightful book it has pleased mr oliphant to christen not  stella and mattie as he might and ought but  altiora peto nothing can be wittier or more amusing than altiora unregenerate  while of altiora regenerate and complete of altiora with a mission and a husband contrived ad hoc the less that is said the better altiora is introduced to the reader as the posthumous child of a certain mr peto by a lady now married to her third husband and as the stepdaughter of one grandesella an italian baron a financier of doubtful antecedents and a reputation not at all above suspicion mr peto as she informs her diary  was a profound but eccentric philosopher with a quaint vein of humour of which indeed i am the victim for his dying request to mamma was that if i was a girl i should be called altiorathus making me the subject of a gentle pun that will stick to me till i die or marry about her father she has she says  a great many odd feelings one of which is that in consequence of his having died ere she was born he has been able to exercise an occult influence over mo from the first moment of my existence which would not have been possible had he remained in though flesh that in fact she is pervaded by his essence and that both morally and intellectually his spiritual nature in somo subtle manner is constantly operative within her this is the reason she thinks why she has  so little sympathy with other girls from these she differs enormously   in the first place life does not seem to present them with any problems  they believe everything they are told take everything as it comes see no contradictions anywhere and do not seem haunted by the standing obligation which has been laid upon me to  seek higher things they grnoveli dont wish to seem uncharitablebut they really do and are content to me life is a perpetual enigma to which no theological system offers a satisfactory solutionagainst the reefs of which all philosophies break into foam and empty bubbles the girl who can write thus at nineteen and who at ten  could have hopelessly puzzled either the archbishop of canterbury or mr herbert spencer has it must be owned about as little in common with the young women of thackeray as with the young women of mr henry james reflective serious passionate even with a habit of selfsearching and selfanalysis crowned with a name full of mystical promise and suggestiveness and with nothing wanting save experience and a theory of the universe you feel as you read that she is bound for those altitudes of spiritual destiny where none but the author of  piccadilly  or the poet of paul faber can move and live that however by no means prevents her from being to begin with at once delightful and amusing mr oliphant with a touch of satire that is both just and humane has started by making lier as she fancies in love and in love with ronald macalpine the most trumpery malo creature in his collection when we first become acquainted with her she is making up her mind to go nnd meet macalpine on the beach pretending to herself that she does not want to go and analysing the preloo afr an hil mj pe mi is de wi fe a tb p1 lil at t ul ol n v n w t tl a a h 8 f f f tence with the pitiless clarity of a spinoza in petticoats on her return she confesses to a love scene and to a great deal besides this for instance is how she is moved to think and feel concerning her sweethearts personal appearance   he is tall dark and in his highland dress looks the beauideal of a scottish chief i am afraid even if he had not been so very clever and agreeable as he is i should still have liked him on account of his tout ensemble why this mysterious sentiment which i am now experiencing for the first time should dr pend so much upon the accident of external appearance is another puzzle can it be possible that so deep a passion can really have any connexion with clothes and colour or that i should have felt differently towards him in trousers   and these are the terms in which she records the effects of his declaration  he gently but firmly took my hand and pressed it to his lips of course i should h we liked to let him keep it so i snatched it away and suddenly began to tremble very violently this shows how utterly incapable the will is under certain circumstances to control the organism the hatred and contempt i felt for my own body at that moment was indescribable why should it possess a power of humiliating me at a time when all my feminine instincts which i suppose are my noblest made me wish to disguise my real feelings towards him  on the other hand what was there humiliating in allowing him to perceive that i returned his affection i if i was angry with my body for humiliating me i felt equally angry with my soul or whatever though other part of me is for feeling humiliated i got so absorbed in this physiological dilemma that for a moment j forgot all about him and putting down my paintbrushit was my left hand he had kissed i clasped them both together and gazed vacantly out to sea from this pass of emotional bewilderment she goes on to feeling very happy to enjoying herself as one in a group after a famous millais and in the end to experiencing a sense of mortification in the reflection that my conduct had not been by any means so strikingly original as i should have predicted it would have been whenever an event of so much importance should occur to me her mother a stout round brisk little woman very practical and matter of fact with a ncz retrousse light hair grey eyes and a temper to matchwill not hear of the business altiora of course is deeply wounded but next day macalpine after listening to a statement of his mistresss views in matters spiritual cuts his own throat by observing with a pleased smile that ho and she are both agnostics  ho had no sooner made this remark says altiora  than i felt that all was at an cud between us she refrains it is true from unpocketing her notes for an essay she is writing  on the anomalies of civilised existence as tested by intuitive aspirations in ideal life but she proceeds to argue the point with him though discussion is interrupted by the approach of her stepfather grandesella with an ordsr to pack up an i start for paris that very night and though upshot is that she concludes this first instalment of her diary in such terms as these   so ends the history of my first delusion i wonder whether the experience of my life is t be that it is made up of themwhether tl io satisfaction which most people seem to derive from existence arises from the fact that they live on the surface and dont dig deep enough to find that it is made up of illusions that the financial operations of the baron and mr murkle are haa long become clear to me  that the social ambitions of my mother are is no less evident all the three individuals with whom my life ia moat closely associated are pursuing shadows and they persist in dragging me with them next year i am to be launched upon the society of london and no pains are to be spared to make me a successin other words to make me another illusion  that is what it comes to the only things that seem to me real are poverty sicknesssuffering of all sorts i am strongly inclined to think that if you go deep enough everything else is sham but perhaps that is only because i am young and my experience of life so far has had a tendency to make me morbid there must surely be another side to the medal  and on that hypothesis i solemnly dedicate my life to its discovery all thisand all we have left unquoted is excellent comedy what follows is as good or even better in his next chapter mr oliphant introduces though two most natural and complete of all his world of characters the californian heiress stella walton and her bosom friend mattie terrill they have come to europo to open their minds and as they are both resolved to see things as they are they have chawged names and reputations so that mattie who has a great deal of beauty nnd no money passes for the distinguished heiress stella walton while stella who has heaps of monoy and not much beauty becomes though heiresss poor cousin mattie terrill they are quito fearless and rather impudent they have an abundance of good senso good wit good feeling and good intentions they ave bossed by a wonderful american old maid a certain aunt hannah they aro frank honest spontaneous natural and wholly delightful with the bloodless passionless exquisite young nonentities who 2rovide the modern american nnovelist with materials for though exerciso of his genius they present a contrast as pleasant and complete as can well bo imagined they become mr oliphanta heroines the moment they enter the story aunt hannah aiding they take possession of altiora they traverse the iniquitous designs of the baron and his partner murkle  they rescuo the hero lord sark from the dutches of the fascinating olymer first of all and afterwards from though ruin he has wrought himself by injudicious proceedings in though city they astonish the elite of society as the duchess of beaucourts guests  they marry altiora to keith hetherington the authors pet heromystic scholar traveller gentlemanone of the vaguest nnd least entertaining personages in good modern fiction  they secure delightful husbands for themselves they write the most amusing letters talk though brightest talk do the most daring things aud bewitch the reader almost as completely in black and white as they might in the flesh thero is nothing for it when they are to the front but to laugh and admire and bo happy they are indeed as human and as irresistible as keith hetherington is unattractive and rorvoto moro than that for them as they who read the story will see it would not be easy to say it is impossible within the limits at our disposal to analyze however briefly though intriguens of balzac touched with george mao donall la m iisi n xueingen liavourcd with robert falconer and though  marquis of lossieof which these charming creatures are the centre or to do more than refer in passing to a few among the crowd of characters in which they are the bright particular stars of altiora herself we have already noted that she falls at once into the background of the story and that moreover she grows less and less interesting as she advances towards that spiritual perfection which her author wills to depict and cannot inseparable from altiora is aunt hannah  rough and racy of speech abounding in good senso and the sweetest humanity  touched with peculiar mysticism gifted with peculiar powers a grotesque for some hundreds of pages of uncommon merit in conception and in execution alike but developing at the last  such is the wickedness of nnovelists even good ones into an abnormal species of monte cristo a monte cristo disguised in spinsterhood and a strong new england brogue another heroic personage is lord sarks enchantress that horrid mrs clymer a mysterious american with all the graces except the grace of chastity all the talents oxcept a talent for honesty all the qualities that make a woman fashionable and none of those that make a woman good alert resolute and unscrupulousone of the boldest and completest sketches in modern fiction then with his  peculiar dark predatory look there is grandesollus partner murkle of whom altiora remarks to her journal that  if ever there was a man whom ono word could describe  murkle is the man and  pounce  is the word there is grandesella himself who says miss peto always made though impression upon me of a turkey gobbler in a perpetual stato of strut  there is lord sark the most engaging and human of recent heroes there is lord sarks friend bob alderney delighted to have but a pound a day and translating the yacna and  vispered and all the other writings on mazdeism there is macalpine poet and musician art nit ic and agnostic a type of the harmless necessary humbug of society mixed up with these are gay old dukes and delightful old duchesses stockbrokers agitators artists in explosives doctors fashionable beauties dandies tame cats curates queens of finance speculators russian princessesa mob of individualities recruited from all the corners of society not one of them but with something to recommend him to our notice and to fix our attention if but foran instant not ono but with the capacity to bear his part to admiration in the general mellay and to completely justify his author in electing to create and uso him how fresh and lifelike they appoar and how brilliantly and strikingly they faro we hardly need to say from mr oliphant as a writer of apostolical romance it is possible as wo have shown to differ pretty vigorously with mr oliphant as an artist in dialogue as a social satirist as a painter of men and manners it is impossible to do other than agree there is his j real strength there is his truo success there are dull passages in  altiora peto  j thero are touches ot extravagance traces of j hurry hints of confusion glimpses of failure  to boot but for all that though book is ono  that everybody will greedily read and j greatly admire lt is to begin with though  outcojio cf a mind of siugulur originality  and independence and of such qualities aa wit and humour as good breeding and good temper as knowledge of the world and command of character as elegance of style and clarity and expressiveness of diction it contains enough to equip a score of ordinary nnovelists for the production of a 6core of extraordinary nnovels  alt iota peto by laurence oliphant blackwood piccadilly had just enough of sketchy carelessness and improbability to pass for originality and to lead many people into thinking that the author could do much greater things if he liked how far altiora peto has complicated or dispelled this notion it is impossible to say though it is said to have been favourably received we are therefore the more bound to confess at once that we have found it entirely dull and uninteresting both in detail and as a whole the book is an attempt to expand the highclass scientificphilosophicalducal and nethermost west endsociety sketch into a regular nnovel this is done by now and then wedging in some fragments of a theatrical plot which before it is well developed feebly takes fire and expires in a tedious smouldering fashion the whole thing is of a clumsiness whereat the veteran ouida will haply smile still worse is the sideplot of the young californian belles one rich and plain the other poor and pretty who on their european campaign change names in order to baffle the affections of the men after a tiresome round of forgery and personation and numerous offers of marriage related in detail it merely ends in their undeceiving their lovers and nothing more comes of this confusion which is indeed so perplexing that the author is forced to adopt the borrowed names in speaking of the ladies adding very often such useful reminders as only of course she was really stella or stella all the time being really mattie this kind of business is more effective in farce than fiction both these damsels are supposed to be very remarkable hightoned specimens of the west they merely impress one as dull chatterers there is also a new england aunt hannah a curious caricature after the dickens modelindeed her portrait in the illustrations reminds one strongly of mrs fs aunt she is apparently gifted with prophetic and other supernatural powers which in due time become useful in bundling the plot together the final windingup and liquidation however proves a protracted business being delayed by a not very startling dynamite episode trivial and usually wearisome conversation makes up most of the book much space is also occupied by the ruminations and excursuses of the heroine on faith morals love heredity and herbert spencer much of them we were forced to skip miss peto herself is a good creation but can hardly be said to be even sketched in as it is all we can safely say about her is that she had a mamma who really was not her mamma at all and that instinct always thwarted her earnest efforts to love her however she loves plenty of men but which she finally marries we forget for in order to multiply proposal scenes seven or eight couples are constantly interchanging their lovers there is the usual fashionable bit of financea count fosco baron and much talk of bubble companies and amalgamations most will prefer to read the city article at first hand after searching diligently and anxiously we really cannot find a single thing to praise in this book unless it be the grammar and spelling and the big print and thick paper but all that is a poor compliment of course one feels that mr oliphant is a practised writer and a man of ability and culture and that there is nothing to reprobate or make game of in his work all the same it is as clear as his print that he has no more idea of what a nnovel should be than a mummy and that he never can and never will write a nnovel worth yawning over people may say they like it and so critics may think well to pretend to like it and a good many honest souls we dare say really may like it after their fashion because they love to pore over the holy page that tells of duchesses and right honourables aud they have heardprobably trulythat the author has the entree of the most exclusive dens and constantly sees the lions fed any news from the lionhouse is always welcome and if as here it is of a rambling vague and slipshod sort we take it as it comes and for want of a still more inappropriate name call it kindly satire the author is presumably familiar with london society we are in joyful ignorance thereof but not without some stray lights upon poor human nature generally while therefore we allow that his personages have a certain resemblance to the gentlemen and ladies one meets in the best houses in london mandalay and squashville they are dreadfully unlike anybody one is ever likely to meet in or out of doors anywhere under the sun because they are not mortals but parts and fragmentsa limb or two and an idea or so and the rest only talk mr oliphant may know but he cannot describe his london society as we gather it from his hazy fragments is a society which cannot be for it is a house divided against itself thus we are asked to believe in the very superior firstclass virtue of his young ladies yet these virgins and their virtuous mothers are for ever discussing what is to be done for dear lord sark the most eligible parti of the season this ghastly bore is cohabiting with a woman of illfame whom the virgins speak of as  the cly mer not only are they intimate with mrs clymer but they alone or abetted by their mammas hold nauseous conferences with his lordship who sentimentally bemoans himself over the irresistible spells of the syren and in return for his fashionable confidences is very elegantly compassionated and wept over we dont believe it the world is the world all the world over but we strongly suspect that our betters are after all ju3t a little bit better and not a thousand times worse than the rest of us e

the transgression of andrew vane by guy wetmore carry heinemann goethe has supplied a criticism of the eagles shadow and he might give a motto for  the transgression of andrew vane  denn ail schuld racht sich auf erden is the burden of this rather disagreeable but undeniably clever nnovel if the theory be true that men of irredeemably evil and iniquitous nature can have no offspring then the foundation of this book would fall to pieces or we should at least be spared the singularly repulsive incident whioh forms the subject of its prologue for radwalader the villain of the piece is about as pernicious a caitiff as iago himself but if we admit this initial incidentand it certainly does strike us as highly improbablewe must confess that the plot is very ingeniously worked out and the interest rises in intensity to the end paris is the scene of the story but america claims most of its characters and the author evidently writes with knowledge if not altogether with approbation of his countrymens life in their terrestrial paradise andrew vane the resolute levelheaded but inexperienced youth who is temporarily led astray in that city of seductions is a good study of character and several of the other men are well drawn the women are not we think so successful the authors purpose seems sincere and his teaching is sound and yet the book somehow fails to inspire sympathy it lacks something and while its merits are sufficient to make us judge it by an unusually high standard it does not wholly satisfy the demands it thus raises  the transgression of andrew vane by guy wetmore carryl 63 iteinemann the american colony in paris is declared by a clever character in this brilliant and clever story to be  as much like america as a cold veal cutlet with its gravy coagulatedif you ve ever seen thatis eke the same thing fresh off the grill but this is unjust to the colony itself as mr carryl depicts it andrew vane a clean young american who comes over to win the heart of miss palffy soon discovers himself in a society where piquant and even poisonous ingredients are at his lip mademoiselle tremonceau a beautiful parisian cocotte diverts him for a time from his quest and his transgression need not be further indicated one does not feel quite convinced by margery palffys treatment of her lover but the rest of the book is a considerable success of its kind mr carrvl has handled a risky subject with no unnecessary frankness though be has not written for maidens and boys evidently he knows paris he writes dialogue with a nimbleness that is unusual even among american nnovelists and the general tone of the story is finer than its subject might indicate,novel

gore s later nnovels there is the old cunning in the hand that draws the characters but it is guided by a more merciful and therefore a more discerning spirit the worldliness which was the original sin of mrs gores nnovels is if not wholly eradicated at least much less deeply dyed mrs gore has drawn her characters with more discrimination of shades and she has gone more into the heart of things than she generally has done the first volume is the best and by far the most interesting the scene in prison between the poor old father and his unhappy son is very touching the rise and progress of mark barneson is done well and in a good spirit mrs gore cannot draw manufacturers and their establishments like one who is to the manner bom but she does it well enough for the purposes of a nnovel the vagueness with which she touches in the incidents and environments of marks life contrast with the sharp definite brilliant delineation of the greshoms and ulleswaters of society rhoda lamberts character is well sketched whilst she is a highspirited ambitious girl but her estrangement from her husband is weakly handled men and women do not act from such compendious motives nor are they except for the convenience of persons writing a story in the habit of going on like machinery in one line of conduct in which every action  has its brother inconsistency is the first law of human nature and as it is the one which nnovel writers find it the most difficult to administer with truth and probability they leave it uuattempted and take to clockwork after the end of the first volume the story diverges into so many details and so many fresh characters are introduced none of whom are sufficiently discriminated that the reader is confused amidst the crowd and does not feel quite sure that he attaches the right names to the right ownersand when the scattered threads of the story are gathered up and woven into a happy marriage between the lady althea and sir walter wrottesley the happy pair do not stand out so distinctly as the central figures round which the last scene gathers ought to do indeed it would puzzle the most practised nnovel reader to decide upon the lawful heroine and legitimate hero of the book for none of the characters are of more importance one than the otherthe general interest has been so divided that nobody in the story can claim a place in the memory after once the book is closed the two aristocracies contains nevertheless pleasant reading and though mrs gore might have made it better we are glad of it as it is,novel

storylovers its chief excellence lying in the fact that it forsook the worn tracts of ordinary romance and came nearer home readers fancied that theyllad met the channings out of the pages of the nnovel in ordinary social intercourse and no book was given with greater confidence into the hands of children by parents than the channings there was a high social tone pervading its pages the characters were not immaculate but real living beings whose alternate shades of darkness and light both in their dispositions and worldly vicissitudes might have found their types in many a pure elevated english household east lynne was not by any means so pure an example but it had very high excellences there was but little that was overstrained the episodes were startling but they were not improbable thecharacters had very decided human weaknesses but they wvere not put forward in an offensive light but rather toned down to meet possible prejudices many objected to certain incidents being incorporated into the story the elopement of the doctors wife through jealousy was not a pleasant subject but the incident is not an uncommon one in ordinary life and it was carefully handled the concluding incidents were the most faulty in the story the return of the first wife in disguise to find another in her place and to be compelled to conceal her identity was rather an awkward conception which although it was got rid of by her speedy death left a most uncomfortable conclusion to the story it had been well for mrs henry woods reputation if she had tried to improve such defects in her style as appearel in her first works  and instead of treating her popularity as a mere commercial speculation to earn money had steadily set herself to study the art of fiction instead of this she has poured from the press a perfect stream of 3 vol nnovels each wvorse than its predecessor with every first fault magnified and numerous fresh ones added unto them until she has disgraced the fair name which was originally so proud an heritage into that ofwe say it advisedlya most dangerous writer airs henry wood seems to imagine that when a little bubble reputation has been once gained any combination of rubbish that may contain a dash of sensationalisma sprinkling of goodygoody talk a deathbed scene and some intricate plot will be accepted by the english public as well worth perusal so long as it emanates froin the same pen as its predecessor she seems to imagine that it is impossible to obliterate by your own wilful carelessness and ignorance of the limits which are generally allowed inl plot and circumstance to writers who have earned the respect of the public every pretension to being called a good and honest author we consider her last two nnovelsnamely  george canterburys will and  bessy rane as fit only to rank amongst the most inferior of sensation nnovels there is a bad moral tone pervading them throughout the atmosphere is unhealthy and not all the cant talk with which they are overlaid can conceal it we do not care to give a sketch of the story we leave it to those who read a story with all the greater avidity which receives adverse criticism from the press but we will insert two specimens of a new style which appears in mrs henry woods nnovels for the first time and leave the general public to judge for themselves it is dickens oliver twist over again with all the refinement extracted her inquisitive eyes turned on the fowl and she saw that the merest bid of the it of the zzier wing was alone eaten  perhaps he is not well

liberally for me this afternoon mamma  there may be such another mother and son as this residing in  a hall but we should imagine that if they have existence they would inhabit  a hnovel such conversation being more appropriate to such a residence we do not doubt that the book will be extensively read and in popular demand unfortunately it is no criterion of the quality of a book to be so but we must express our great regret that a writer with the natural gifts for fiction which mlrs wood possessed should have debased her writings to the level she has done,novel
nnovel notes a comedy of sentiment by max nordau translated by jessie haynes 6s heinemann the fame of herr nordaus versatility has spread even here so that he can write a clever nnovel will not sound an astonishing addition to his other accomplishments this is a clever nnovel or to speak more accurately it is a story written by a very able manone who might be partial unfair shortsighted and arrogant as able men often are but who could not write balderdash nor from clumsiness misrepresent what he actually understood it is an episode in the life of a scientific man who falls into the toils of a   the private life of warren hastings by sir charles lawson with 3 photogravure portraits 78 illustrations and facsimiles swan designing woman and has a narrow escape we confess we should have respected him more had he not escaped in some respects he is most worthy devoted to his mother with whom he lives delivering up to her his salary as he receives it and having no secrets from her till frau ehrwein comes into his life but there is another side of him which revolts us while giving way tu his sensual passions he is perfectly aware of his folly and he exhibits a hard calculating and most unhumorous temper throughout his liaison which is complicated by his weak and insincere attempt to play the part of devoted lover as for paula the less said about her the better her efforts to entrap bruchstidt are so noisy violent and vulgar that they would disgust a tavernhaunter and when he is in her toils she keeps him there by the grossest flattery for the most sordid pecuniary reasons those who read  the comedy of sentiment  within a reasonable time of reading a much greater book jude the obscure may observe a certain likeness between paula and arabella but the dash of generosity in the rough coarse arabella is wanting in this woman of culture who if less ugly is more corrupt of course herr nordau looks on her as she ought to be looked on but there is so little relief to her vileness bruchstfidts prosaic calculating nature and his ridiculous game of love affording none at all that the picture is more sordid and crueller than we like to look at save on the canvas of one whose art and whose human sympathy are greater than herr nordaus,novel
prudence palfrey prudence palfrey by t b aldrich in one volume george routledge and sons  prudence palfrey  is already on the railway stalls by the 3ide of its predecessor  marjorie daw in giving us this new nnovel mr aldrich has conferred a benefit on locomotive humanity aldrich has murdered sleep the unhappy nocturnal traveller will we can confidently assert be absorbed in  prudence palfrey until either the story or the journey comes to an abrupt end mr aldrichs sprightly and witty narration would carry his reader with unflagging interest through a far longer nnovel  prudence palfrey  is a short story and its winding up is so rapid that we can fancy it written as well as intended to be read on a railway journey and that the finale was dashed off as the train whirled screaming into the terminus  prudence palfrey is a pretty orphan heires3 of her guardian old mr dent the old gentleman was attached to prues mother and is now very much inclined to keep prue for himself altogether but mr dent has a penniless young nephew john and john falls in love with prue and she is more than half in love with him john doesnt speak to prudence but he tells his uncle all about it like a frank honest fellow as he is and when the uncle is very angry there are high words between them and john makes up his mind to go golddigging to california before he sets out the young people have one little accidental meeting remembered ali their lives afterwards john is too wise to ask for any promises he goes to put money in his pure and will come back for prue he tells her when he is rich prue says slyly but suppose i have married  old robin gray in the meantime and john replies generously  you are free to do it they part and prue waits heavyhearted till the crown shall become a pound and her john come back to marry her it seems doubtful however whether this will ever occur for john meets with a villainous chum who robs him of all his gains and escapes with the plunder leaving the luckless lover to begin all over again prudence waits three years uncertain whether john is alive or dead meantime old mr dent is laying his plans at home a new clergyman has been introduced chiefly by his influence into the old brick church the rev mr dillingham is young rich highlyeducated and of a serious disposition all the young ladies of his congregation set their caps at him he is charmed with the society of mr dent and his ward  though his manner to prue is never that of a lover and prue is a little nettled to find that she has so little power over the interesting and popular young clergyman therefore when one day mr dillingham suddenly proposes to prudence she cannot help feeling surprised and pleased and asks for a short respite to consider her answer the time allotted passes away and still prue wavers mr dillingham himself turns the balance how could he be so foolish as to select from all j the music on the piano that one little scotch song for prue to sing to him it is auld robin grey  and prudence sings with a strange passion breaks down and hurries away to her own room she can sing no more to mr dillingham that last meeting with john under the trees by the garden seat has she ever forgotten it  the old old love has come backfor ever up to this time the story has run on smoothly enough but now on a sudden john comes back a ragged wraith with a broken arm and discovers that the portrait of mr dillingham is the portrait of his villainous chum who ran off with the money bags and has since attempted to shoot john through the head on the same day mr dillingham absconds leaving a bleating and shepherdless flock and several damsels in despair and now discoveries are unearthed like potatoes mr dillingham preached from known authors mr dillingham had a habit of carrying off valuables from his friends houses  and lastly mr dillingham had proposed to and been accepted by a young lady a friend of prues if old mr dent is chagrined at his want of discrimination as regards the character of the enigmatical young clergyman he cannot feel more acutely ashamed of himself than does the reader of the story who has been completely gulled by mr aldrich to the very last moment the fault which most strikes us in the plot of mr aldrichs story is that he does not sufficiently explain though motives of the clerical scamp we are left to wonder what feelings on mr dillinghams part could have prompted him to come a wolf in sheeps clothing into the heart of johns family and why he sent an emissary to track and murder john if he meant to marry prudence and so possess himself of old mr dents money we could understand it but if this was his motive why does mr aldrich engage him subsidiarily to the other young lady who must eventually in any case have published his conduct and ruined his prospects  if mr aldrich intends the clerical gentleman to be a riddle without an answer he succeeds indubitably the story would have been a pretty and complete one and perhaps more artistic if mr dillingham had not been a villain but simply prues other suitorher  old robin gray but it would certainly not have been so excitingnot such a railway nnovel in fact there is one other character in the story which we must mention before we conclude it is parson wibird hawkins the old man who was shelved to make room for mr dillingham  who had been pastor of the parish for fifty years and of whom the parish was tired  whose dearest wish was that when the spirit of the lord came to take him it might find him in the pulpit of the old brick church who died very quietly on the evening of his abdication sitting in his study with his bible on his knees a brokenhearted man mr aldrich possesses a keen sense of the pathetic as well as of the humorous there are scraps of description in his storysuch as the old parsonage garden with its marigoldbeds and its little green bench under the vines and again the ruined fort on the hilltop with the varied landscape unrolling itself  like a coloured map beneathwhich though brief are rich and indelible we feel sure that  prudence palfrey  will be widely and deservedly popular m f,novel
the wifes evidence by w g wills 3 vols j hurst  blackett i in the wifes evidence there are the materials for an excellent nnovel of strong interest j if the author would only have told his tale quietly and steadily the subject is unhackneyed and there are skill and originality in  building up the incidents and drawing the i characters but the author loses time and space by indulging in declamatory bits of elo quence and in the desire to be dramatic he  has weakened the effect of a story sufficiently remarkable to need no adventitious aid of rhetoric the outline of the tale is briefly as follows a son long estranged from home by a quarrel with his father has married made his own way in the world and been for some time successful as a literary man and editor of a journal he is however at the opening of the story on the verge of bankruptcy the first scenes are merely introductory to show the character of the man and the nature of the charming good wisehearted wife whom he is so fortunate as to possess screening her brother who having been his confidential clerk had embezzled a large sum of money has been the real cause of colemans embarrassments and nearly of his disgrace coleman will not disclose the secret of a man whom he has pardoned and who is repenting his crime but his wife proves the facts and his good name is cleared the wilful character of the man in adhering to a course of action he has once adopted is well illustrated in these preliminary scenes but they are too long and too minutely drawn out they detain the reader from the main interest of the tale after the affairs of the bankruptcy are wound up coleman his wife and child go into somersetshire to stay with his mother now a widow and sole mistress of the paternal acres her character is well and clearly drawn full of good sense and geniality she has also a vein of fierce untractable matteroffact implacability lying beneath the surface mother and son resemble each other in their dogged tenacity of purpose she and her son have never been estranged all these years they have been in regular correspondence and on his fathers death she would have had him home only that he was then following his own career in london she receives him and his wife with a hearty welcome whilst little johnny their son is the delight of her heart the return to the old home and the description of the life there led are well done the character of coleman is well developed with his quaint genial humour his tenderness for his wife and the gnarled perverse knot of obstinacy in his nature with which only his wife can deal domesticated in the family they find the farm bailiff a rude florid coarse goodlooking man who had become manager of the farm on the death of the husband when coleman could not or would not return to take his own place as head of the family in the years that have elapsed the bailiff has secured his influence and coleman discovers that his mother is on the brink of marrying him fondly hoping that they may still continue to live together as a happy family all this story is well and skilfully told the scene between mother and son is extremely good and the character of the old woman is very true to human nature when her son reproaches her with disrespect to his fathers memory lowe your father nothingshe said your father did me a mean turn which i have not forgotten and shant forget to my dying day your aunt dora could tell you all about it its no matter no matter but you have minded me of a good reason for what i mean to do for gods sake what has my father done mother which could influence you to sacrifice yourself i always believed that you and my father lived happily eh dear happily that is the happiness i never talk of injustice or wrongs but i dont think of em the less not much happened since then in this quiet house to put em out of my mind then to the quiet astonishment of her son who scarcely trusted his ears she gave him the history with feminine bitterness and detail of a certain velvet mantle which her husband had long promised her and made a deal of fuss about when it arrived she could have put a piedish under cither shoulder it was such an illfit and she wished to have it sent back and altered what do you think he did will he tumbled the mantle into its box and sent it off as a present to your aunt dora the woman of all the world i hate the most and he told me to my face a few days after that he had heard from her to say it was a good fit for her i have done him many a kind turn since that will and i sat up for six nights with him when he wab dying without ever taking off my clothes but i tellee i was thinking of that drees when i looked from my window and saw the velvet on his hearse with all this implacability there is a simple straightforwardness in the old lady which wins the readers sympathy shemarries the bailiff with a guileless trust that is almost heroic of course though natural result followshe has married her for her money and proves a coarse tyrant her son and his wife stay beside her to shield and comfort her and to be ready to take her away when she is willing to go but the catastrophe comes quickly personally illused her husband drawing all her hardlysaved money and squandering it in riotous living bringing his mistress into the house the wretched old woman is maddened with indignation one night coming home drunk after a lengthened absence he insults her beyond her power to endure he reels upstairs to bed and she fetches a hatchet and murders him in his sleep her son hearing a noise goes to her room and finds her standing with the hatchet in her hand the necessity for action the instinct to saare his mother at whatever cost prompt him to take measures which have the effect of involving him in a aveb of suspicious and incriminating circumstances his avife who alone could have given the information which avould have cleared him is kept by him out of the way at the coroners inquest the result is that he is committed for trial along with the old lady as guilty of the murder he then deliberately resolves to sacrifice himself his wife and child and to save his mother a wife cannot give evidence in a criminal case either for or against her husband eleanors despair her efforts her baffled endeavours to make the truth heard are well described but in the last volume the style is throughout declamatory and rhetorical which aveakens the effect the quietest and most steady avriting was needed to make the working out of colemans fanaticism probable or pleasant he prefers his mother to his avise and child and having decided to save her it needed great delicacy and good management on the part of the author to carry the sympathy of the reader with him but he wastes all his strength to illustrate the hardship of the law that prevents a wife bearing testimony for her husband and to this purpose the symmetry and strength of the nnovel is sacrificed coleman trifles with his avife deceives her keeps her at arms length and behaves to her in a manner entirely unworthy of her faithfulness and courage the whole of the last volume is hurried there is a want of good workmanship which is the more provoking as the author has shown himself quite capable of the mechanism of his craft all that passes after the trial is weak and confused a condemned murderer is not allowed to leave his cell and go out into the avorld on a mere  reprieve the statement of the old lady given under the influence of an overdose of laudanum would have required corroboration and her confession is so hazy that it reads more like the murmuring of delirium than a definite statement the scene between eleanor and her husband in prison when she brings him the good news is feeble and unsatisfactory the author appears to have become weary of his task or else to have considered it unnecessary to finish up his work in a businesslike manner he gives all his care and attention to the sensation scenes instead of considering his work as a whole the character of michael the irish retainer is clever and his mode of dealing with the witnesses is amusingly characteristic but there is too much of him and he is too stagey to touch the sympathy of the reader the author of the wifes evidence is capable of writing a powerful wellsustained nnovel and we hope he will give us one that will do justice to his talent,novel
bralcespeare  or the fortunes of a free lance by the author of  guy livingstone 3 vols tinsley brothers as it is useless to expect that the author of  guy livingstone will ever write anything but feeble imitations of his original work we were not surprised at meeting once more the renowned  guy  himself in the form of a free lance of the fourteenth century bralcespeare is that heros name in the present nnovel and he rejoices in all those charming characteristics with which the nnovelreading public are so familiar there may be a few enthusiastic beings not yet glutted with these reproductions of  guy livingstone the gigantic strength the towering height enormous muscles forbidding face loose morals and pedantic speech cease even to amuse by the farcical exaggeration with which they are portrayed whilst common sense rebels more and more at such a grotesque caricature being presented to us as a possible human being when we mention then that bralcespeare is a guy livingstone who conquers his enemies in the same easy fashion and who combines in the same happy way the maudlin sentiment of the schoolgirl with the brutal ferocity of the garotter and that this gentleman constitutes the book itself we have said enough to show the nature of the story we are bound in fairness however to state that bralcespeare himself is certainly the least of the guys who have yet appeared he apparently seduces no mans wife does not blaspheme so much as usual and only murders one poor page this is an improvement on the other hand the number of men slaughtered in fair fight rather exceeds the ordinary number may we humbly petition the author to make his next hero talk in a slightly less stilted form for even if we could manage to get over his other peculiarities his language has always been too much for us here we are sorely punished brakespeare guy employs even a more absurd lingo than usual it is a curious mixture of modern english with a few obsolete words and this mixture has the frame of each sentence curiously twisted from its proper state till a wonderfully pompous and laughable language is the result the author apparently labours under the impression that a free use of the following sentences and words gives his creations a smack of nobility and antiquity these are  wottest thou why  for which misdeed may god assoilzie him  bewray counsel  guerdon  brache  ontrecuidance  i wis  malapert vassals  valiance  destrere c we can assure him that if he imagines the language employed in this nnovel bears the smallest resemblance to that used by a knight in the reign of edward the third he is mistaken the mistake is about as palpable and funny as that made by mrs plornish in  little dorrit when she flattered herself she was talking italian we do congratulate the author however most sincerely on one circumstance which distinguishes the present work from all his previous efforts in this circumstance he has exercised an amount of selfnegation and selfcontrol for which we hardly gave him credit they who know  guy livingstone and the succeeding works of the same class well will thoroughly appreciate the fact that the word  bersekyr has only been used three times in the whole of this nnovel what may we not hope for in time i,novel
gerald fitzgerald the chevalier new nnovels by charles lever downey  co it seems curious to be reviewing a nnovel by charles lever at this time of day but this is actually the first time that this nnovel has appeared in book form 4 gerald fitzgerald was published in serial form in the dublin university magazine but when lever shortly before his death rearranged his nnovels for a fresh issue he omitted 4 gerald fitzgerald with a few others for this reason the present publishers seem very rightly to have hesitated about publishing it but thanks are due to them for having overcome their scruples this book will not recall the truly irish jollity and joyous extravagance of 4 charles omalley and 4 harry lorrequer but in a more serious vein it is a right good story of adventure gerald fitzgerald appears as the son by a legal but secret marriage of the young pretender and an irish lady and he goes through the most surprising adventures and meets the most interesting people before he is even recognised as a claimant to the throne of england mirabeau alfieri madame roland and the lady who personated the goddess of reason in a wisp of gauze are a few of the characters with whom he is thrown into contact and even such well  known personages gain in interest from levers presentment of them in these pages this is especially the case with mirabeau whose personal force and extraordinary attractiveness are described with marvellous insight the chief thing which recalls levers audacity of imagination is however the imbroglio of adventures into which the hero is thrust and in spite of the strength of the subordinate characters the author manages to invest his hero with much charm and to make him really the centre of his story,novel
  fiction sacred and profane love by arnold bennett chatto  windus os  mr bennett appears before the public in a dual capacityas a triter of lucrative trash and as an artist we have no concern with mr bennetts artistic conscience he knows what he is about better than most men in all he does that quality of assurance is manifest and he does nothing that is not good ot its kind his melodramas fantasias he is clever enough to call themcould not fail to satisfy the abandoned craving for sensation  his criticism should be better known than it is his essay on george moore in  fame and fiction  expresses one point of view with singular precision and some beauty his  a great man  has wit but his best up till now is undoubtedly to be found in  anna of the five towns  in  leonora and in his latest book which is now before us we feel that these are his work the others are simply turned off for amusement in leisure moments safetyvalves for his superfluous steam in  sacred and profane love  mr bennett has set himself a great task he narrates the three experiences of passion that have come into the life of a strong and beautiful womana character which any imaginative writer might well be proud to have created her name name is carlotta and she tells her own story the personal method of narration is in this case a necessity and is not thc least of the many difficulties that have beset mr bennetts path and over which he has triumphed by the power of his technique the chief difficulty however is to make the theme noble the least wavering or uncertainty of grip in the author and the theme of passion infallibly and swiftly becomes ignoble and sordid here again mr bennett has succeeded  he has created feeling that is intense enough and sincere enough to need no apology  but here also in our opinion lies the weak point of the book he has not sufficiently trusted to bis power to ennoble the theme on its own merits he has made use of artifice which was not necessary for him he has no need to make the lover diaz a worldfamed pianist by so doing he weakens the essential by introducing an element of improbability into the opening phase of the book and again at the end the emotional intensity is lowered and not heightened to climax by the superficial pomp of diazs triumph in the paris operahouse a weaker writer would have had need for all the glitterand tinsel which he could command mrbennett has not tinsel merely serves to obscure the large humanity of his treatment conspicuous when carlotta steals down into the hall of the hotel in the early morning and bus the boatshaped straw hat from the servant girl and comes in contact with the people starting for their work on her journey home conspicuous too throughout the second part and especially in the scenesplendidly dramaticbetween carlotta and mrs ispanlove a weak whimpering woman who rouses all the pity in the strong heart of carlotta conspicuous in the character of the very old man lord alcar these are touches of genius  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett chatto  windus there is not very much sacred love in mr bennetts nnovel which is obviously inspired by a study of modern frenoh fiction the story is told in the first person by miss carlotta peel whose career is one must hope unusual in the first chapters we find her a victim to the celebrated pianist diaz on the first occasion of their meeting later she becomes the mistress of a publisher who issues her books for she is a popular writerindeed we gather a famous writer since when she again encounters diar he knows of her repute the publisher on hearing that his wife has committed suicide blows out his brains but carlotta undismayed continues her career of sacred or profane love  whichever mr bennett calls it diaz has unhappily become a dipsomaniac but she heroically redeems him from his degrading vice and writes the libretto of an opera which startles paris and then she dies what mr bennett means if he means anything it is hard to discover his tale reads like a parody of a french nnovel and at times is positively grotesque certainly if it has been his object to depict the amours of an illregulated woman he has failed to realise her for us carlotta is only such a woman as seen from the outside by mr bennett and as composed by him from imagination she never convinces us and though the ways of women are well known to be inscrutable they are not so unnecessarily wanton as hers this is how she explains herself to the publisher but it does not seem to advance us much  for me there are two beingsmyself and the observer of myself it is the nnovelists disease this duplication of personality when i said illusion i meant the supreme illusion of love is it not an illusionwill it last who knows by that time carlotta ought to have had a shrewd suspicion it would not  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett i chatto and windus in one wvay  sacred and profane love  seems to us a nnovelty in english fiction the heroine is a woman who errs willinglyxultingly yet mr arnold bennett neither excuses her apologises for her moralises over her nor punishes her ihe lets her tell her own tale leaves her to the charity of his readers she justifies her own existence and the manner of it mr arnold bennetts technique is such that the rather melodramatic plot is by no means necessary to sustain interest and provoke us to read on the wvriting itself is sufficient to do that  sacred and profane leave  is a piece of bravura astonishing in ifs strength and rapidity and we mav add in its directness where most writers would go no further than insinuation carlotta and dia dominate the story of course but we like as much some of the minor characters and less fateful scenescarlotta slinking home in a train crowded with worlkpeople her appreciation of her dead aunts calm colourless life diaz practising the parisian ladies with the feignoirs lord alcar and the satirical sketch of mfrs sardis  that impeccable dovenne of serious english fiction if wve have a fault to find it is that the illumination cast on the characters is too much of the stage the move under a limelight which may emphasise the acuteness but as surely diminishes the subtlety of mfr arnold bennetts psychology,novel
fiction lady roses daughter by mrs humphry ward smith ulcler us julie le breton the central figure in  lady roses daughter was suggested by the career of mdlle de lespinasse as madame du deffand supplied the framework for mrs wards lady henry delafield but julie le breton in the pages of this book is no mere historical figment she is a living woman and the power she exercises over all with whom she comes in contact is suggested with such intellectual appreciation of the moods of her genius that not only does she become one of mrs wards most attractive characters but also one of the most convincing we meet her early in the book the story revolves around her and we part from her in the end regretfully she has been scorched and purified by the fire of experience and of the two men who loved her one things being as they were was not unhappy in dying the other we leave happy in his life through her julie is very human not in the least a saint richly endowed inheriting from her parents those moods and impulses that made lady rose her mother choose exile with a lover to respectability with a husband she disliked to julie comes a similar temptation she too runs to meet it and is only saved by chance and the devotion of another of her adorers that man was delafield a dreamer mystic and individualist who eventually succeeds to a dukedom this is how julie appeared to him  he meanwhile as he advanced further in the knowledge of her strange nature was more and more bewildered by heelier perversities and caprices her brilliances and powers her utter lack of any standard or scheme of life she had been for a long time as it seemed to him the creature of her exquisite social instinctsthen the creature of passion hut what a woman through it alland how adorable with those poetic gestures and looks those melancholy gracious airs that ravished him perpetually  and now this new attitude as of a child leaningwistfully looking in your face asking to be ledto be wrestled and reasoned with it is a crowded canvas where julie le breton warkworth the ambitious selfseeking soldier and delafield move in the foreground at first one is inclined to resent the number of titled and distinguished people there is a duke a duchess a cabinet minister an ambassador a distinguished editor and a host of other more or less eminent controllers of affairs to say nothing of lady henry delafield the grande dame old peevish halfblind who has engaged julie as companion and who realises that it is the amazing charm of this companion that gathers the select crowd to her house we certainly feel the fascination of julie le breton her extraordinary adaptability to circumstances her power of growth the diplomacy of her sympathy  in talking with her dead avails seemed to give way vistas of hope and possibility opened in the very heart of discouragement she found the right word the right jest the right spur to invention or effort in the latter part of the book we escape from the atmosphere of great houses crushes and footmen and the spiritual drama of the action of individual lives one upon the other is worked out by mrs ward with an intellectual sympathy and a knowledge of the complexities of the human soul that has not been surpassed in any of her former books love is not here the sentimental emotion of the ordinary nnovel or play but the power that purges the weaknesses and vivifies the dormant nobilities of men and women warkworth for all his faults had the courage of his impulses and few will read that last letter of his or the sudden news of his death without emotion to julie is left an abiding sorrow and the humanising of delafield  his destiny is to tame and console her here is a picture of delafield the duchess and dr meredith are watching him from a distance  its like something wearing through she said slowly 1 suppose it was always therebut it didnt show name your  it    i cant  but she gave a little shudder which made meredith look at her with curiosity  you feel something ghostly unearthly  she nodded assent crying out however immediately afterwards as though in compunction that he was one of though dearest and best of fellows  of course he is said meredith lt is only the mystic in him coming out he is one of the men who have the sixth sense  well all i know is he has the oddest power over people said evelyn with another shiver  if freddie had it my life wouldnt be worth living thank goodness ho hasnt a vestige    at bottom its the power of the priest said meredith and you women are far too susceptible towards it nino times out of ten it plays the mischief mrs ward writes of the things that matter in the inner individual life and in no former book we think has her touch been surer or her insight into motive and character more searching and sympathetic  new nnovels lady roses daughter by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co mrs humphry wards latest nnovel ip to all intents and purposes the story of mlle de lespinasse translated into circumstances ostensibly english ostensibly we say because despite the change of names and places we are conscious that the world aepictea nere is not ana never was tnat of english society but remains fundamentally french it is the world of the salon an institution which as mrs ward herself confesses has never properly taken root on english soil just as by a quotation from one of mlle de lespinasses letters at a critical point of the story she acknowledges the foreign derivation of her principal character julie le breton is julie de lespinasse the natural daughter of a great lady the comtesse dalbon or lady rose delaney left almost penniless after her mothers death she enters society under a bond of silence as the companion of another great lady madame du deffand or lady henry delafield by sheer force of character and social gift she becomes the centre of all that is brilliant and distinguished in the capital eclipsing her indignant patroness and ends by bringing upon her head explosion and dismissal the question is which way will society go  which will prevail the charm of an engaging but ambiguous personality or the old habits of family connexion rank and respectability  this in any case would be an interesting situation  in the original owing to the greatness of the characters concerned turgot and dalembert the former is represented by montresor in the copy it is a great situation we have to ask what is the effect of it as reproduced in mrs humphry wards book the answer is not doubtful on the one hand mrs wards fiction gains immensely by it on the other the reality itself almost equally suffers after a series of works whose interest was in truth somewhat factitious and topical turning upon a religious political or social question of the day it is a sheer artistic advantage to mrs ward to light upon a subject of wide generality affording scope for a disinterested study of human character and passion to find ready to hand to rest firmly upon a set of facts easily and naturally complicated brimming with fullness and life the reality communicates so much of its own virtue and power to mrs wards book as undoubtedly to raise it in comparison with her own previous effortsat any rate the more recent onesto a very high rank but as compared with the reality itself mrs wards success is far from complete and complete success to say no more was here imperative it is essential to one limb of the situation that we should feel julie le breton to be a creature of extraordinary charm but of this charm in spite of many protestations mrs ward fails to convince us her character is equivocal throughout she is certainly clever  she is perhaps beautiful this is never made quite clear but she intrigues she tells lies she permits herself to love her girlish cousins fiance in a word she is not too straight besides she has fits of morbid emotion and is nearly always under the shadow of physical exhaustion even with these disadvantages a character may possibly be invested with charm but mrs ward has not discovered the secret no julie de lespinasse was not like that nor does the character of jacob delafield satisfy us either he is beyond our depth or he is really confused and unreal lady henry is much better but it is with the minor characters8ir wilfrid bury lord lockington the duke and duchess of crowborough the latter especiallythat mrs ward succeeds the best and they are not so vital to the main situation mrs ward has a saving sense of humour and no more we wish it were a little more positive we wish that these dukes and duchesses lords and ladies ministers and diplomatists were just a shade less reverently treated one more remark mrs ward does not know how to finish a book neatly  and in  lady roses daughter the end is too much taken up with physical ailments a subject which is often harrowing without being truly and poetically affecting  sai notes on nnovels by these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow  lady roses daughter by mrs humphry ward v the history of julie le breton the central figure is known to a few of the habitues of lady henry delatields drawingroom some of them knew her mother ladyrose and the reason of her flight to belgium where she died all feel the influence of julie le bretons fascination particularly two men a selfseeking soldier and the heirpresumptive to a dukedom a searching and sympathetic study of character the theme being the purifying and ennobling iower of love smith elder 6s,novel
poor miss finch a nnovel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many nnovelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation nnovel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation nnovel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss nnovels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior nnovelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss nnovels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a nnovel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to nnovelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective nnovel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five nnovels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his nnovels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six nnovels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a nnovel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a nnovel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a nnovel to have been written by any one else,novel
jack and three jills0 there is a good deal that is clever and more that is amusing in these two neat volumes which in their sober dress of plain red sides and salmonpink back appear to aim at looking like fiction in handyvolumeclassics1 clothing the reader will probably be sufficiently interested to read them through from cover to cover having done so he will probably wonder why he took the trouble as there is no particular plot nor any remarkable excitement and there is a perceptible though perhaps not easily defined flavour of vulgarity about the book not that the characters are vulgar people jack who by the way is george for the first seventy pages is evidently meant to be a sort of pelham written up to date who succeeds in life because somehow he cannot help doing so who belongs to the best clubs and moves in  county  and other very superior society but somehow we feel him to belong rather to bayswater or bloomsbury than to mayfair while yet we are ready to confess as mr russell lowell does in one of his pleasant essays that we tremble before the effort to define the vulgarity of which wre are conscious the fascinating widow or grasswidow with a past which is not a favourite subject of conversation who is the first of the three  jills is a good sketch and the relations between her and jack are capitally described jill the third the american heiress whom mr severn the successful and very selfsatisfied hero ultimately marries is also a very nice girl indeed her father cyrus napoleon washington q rock belongs to the tribe of gilead p beek he too has made his pile and by means of those wonderful oilwells which as mr rock explains providence for its own reasons has confined to the united states  jack and three jills by f c philips 2 vols london  ward  downey he is a good sketch of the shrewd drilyhumorous american selfmade man who has a proper respect for dollars without being in the least purseproud he likes literature and art he enjoys modern paris much and old london even more rummaging out every famous old spot with intense delight his daughter is an american girl of the good sort to prove whether jack severns affections were truly for her or for the dollars mr rock gives out that he is ruined jack however comes triumphantly through the ordeal and we are glad that the bells ring for his wedding with elizabeth rock and not with jill number two the rather vixenish lizzie vivian who swayed his heart for awhile the book will not bear quotation  its merits lie in the ease and fluency of the narrative the brightness and entrain of the style and a certain freshness in the sketching rather than drawing of the characters in the cheerful little drama its worst blemishes are faults of taste which collectively become distinctly bad taste and are to be regretted,novel

a child in the temple by frank mathew lane amongst his other qualities mr matthew has the captivating alluring touch that converts apparent nothings into somethings of a rich and rare kind a child in the  temple is extremely slight almost too vague and misty yet charming one wants to know more of kilmorna castle curly adair kitty moroney the brawling terence and other strongly irish personalities and places if they are not to reappear at some future date we can but look with interest for any other persons and places of which mr matthew may vouchsafe us visions  a child in the temple by frank mathew 3s 6d lane this was meant to be an exquisite little story a good deal of it is exquisite as it stands mr matthew has a wayward imagination a still more wayward sense of humour and they served him well in that far too little appreciated book  the wood of the brambles in this much slighter thing they have led him less happily the child in the temple should have stopped there or should have gone home in poverty to ireland he should have grown wise in the society of his dog and with the tangled affairs of kitty and kilmorra and the others to unravel for of course they would have come to him but he should not have even once gone out into the world and used that revolver he did not the little braggart was lying to mr mathew he would have grown old and wise grown into a kind of charles lamb we imagine he would certainly never have grown up but that rowdy day at the end with the anarchists and the runaway peer and the repentant magdalen and the penitent nobleman at the convent gate and the  child  mixed up in it all is a nightmare and to dismiss the wise  child at the end with an estate and a decent income is to treat him most undeservedly as a philistine  a child in the temple by frank mathew john lane the title of this story suggests the infant samuel but the book is about other and more recent matters yet what it actually is about one would have difficulty in saying there is by way of prologue an account of an old irish nobleman entomologist who nae the customary brokendown fortunes and halfruined house this is well done and the description of the childhood of florence the storys hero who tells the tale and curly his playmate is pleasant too but years pass and we are transported to the temple where a vagueness comparable only to a london fog sets in during the remaining 150 pages many things happen but one sees them as in a glass darkly persons to whom the reader is not introduced appear and disappear and nothing is sufficiently explained mr matthew may retort that bis intention was to leave an indistinct impression well he has done so but at the expense of at least one readers interest here is a passage of more humour than relevance showing how the child who is a grown man is assured by a policeman that kitty moroney has not committed suicide  44 at the near end of the bridge i got out of the cab and accosting a stiff constable asked had there been an accident lately 4 accident p said he sternly 4 wot accident p 4 well said i airily with a show of indifference41 mean hasthat is did anyone fall in the river p 4 three said he solemnly 4 three

ordinary families by e amnot robertson cape 7s 6d the flowering thorn by mar gery sharp arthur barker 7s 6d salah and his american by leland hall cresset press 7s 6d miss e arnot robertsons fourth nnovel has been chosen by the book society for august which means i suppose that mr walpole has already used all the best superlatives about it and that by the time this review appears in print those same superlatives will have been lavishly spilled all over the advertisement columns of the sunday papers let me start then with my only complaint ordinary families lacks pattern it is a tranchie de vie somewhat arbitrarily hewn with characters wandering in and out of it at will and only a slender unifying idea which is apt to be lost to sight in a maze of side issues it is perhaps less a fine nnovel than a book by a fine nnovelist and the book society has done well to encourage a young writer who is undoubtedly going to give us even better books than this the idea behind a not very good title is that  no family however ordinary on the outside is ordinary when one comes to know it intimately  actually it is difficult to imagine that the three families with which we chiefly have to dorush cottrell and questwould be strictly ordinary to the most detached view rush pare sailor boatbuilder and exadventurer would be heartily welcome in place of many an  ordinary  father and quest pare is one of those delightful eccentrics whom one meets with luck once or twice in a lifetime to the greater reading public it is not ordinary to manoeuvre sailingcraft with the mastery to which the whole quest family seems to have been born and it is certainly very far from ordinary to write about sailing as miss robertson does while if birdwatching were an ordinary pursuit lallie rush would have been elbowed out of those enchanting hours enchantingly described on the east coast dunes but it is at all events the common lot of mankind to grow up and the story takes us boldly through the adolescence of lalage and the parallel development of her brothers and sisters and friends what an ordinary what a tempting and what an alarmingly difficult theme i only the most unflinching sincerity could carry it through and miss robertson has that she has also fearless logic penetrating irony and infallible observation all at hand to guide the spontaneous emotion which informs every page of her writing if her book lacks pattern it also lacks purpose which is a thing for which to thank heaven fasting i mean that she is concerned to prove no thesis and point no very clear moral though the wit of her characterization forms itself at times into missiles for aunt sallies that richly merit them miss margery sharp is another clever woman writer and it is no criticism of the flowering thorn to say that beside ordinary families it wears an air of superficiality it is a brightly written and well constructed tale of the postwaugh school though the characters hover rather nearer to life than do the delicious grotesques of mr evelyn waugh lesley frewen acting on a whim adopts an orphan boy and forsakes her familiar cocktail environment to look after him in a country cottage thus the thorn flowers lesley is as it were regenerated and we leave her awaiting the coming of andrew bentall a nice worthwhile young man the plot may sound silly but the book is not it is quite consistently amusing and enjoyable salah and his american is one of those unusual books which the wide cloak of modem fiction takes in at its fringes it is a document of uncommon interest in a year which has seen the celebration of the wilberforce centenary for it gives a credible and fascinating picture of a negro to whom the word  slave  connotes nothing of shame or injustice the tragedy arises when his american protector a traveller in morocco has to answer his request to be given what the white man calls an  opportunity  the liberty of the modem industrial theorist is an uncomfortable gift this book has no sexinterest but it is very nicely illustrated francis watson,novel

  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a nnovel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous nnovel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the nnovel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering has secretly loved her but he has exchanged into a regiment going to india to put himself out of the reach of temptation georgie has a cousin ida who is engaged to be married to another of the four friendsthe rev geoffrey luttrell an honest frank simplehearted sporting clergyman much more orthodox on points of shooting and salmonfishing than on divinity ida is a thoroughlywicked woman and the demon of the story she is madly in love with dering georgie has a narrow escape from the pranks of a vicious horse which she has wilfully insisted on mounting maurice dering saves her there is a capital description of the  race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief there is a certain gerald annesley a handsome blackguard who has known georgie in former times and who has stirred the first romantic feelings of her heart he renewb acquaintance with her and ida sets herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lnovely face the lnovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or satisfactory,novel

our library table barbaras history by amelia b ed wards 3 vol hurst andl blacken  it i would be impossible for miss edwards to write i anything which should beuninteresting therefore i barbaras history has interest but the story 1 merely serves the purpose of rendering a note ji book of continental travel over beaten tracts  saleable and is not in itself either complicated 1 l or artistically worked out hugh farquhar is a highlyaccomplished gentleman who exhibits a large amount of booklearning conveyed in very clever and brilliant conversations which it would be delightful to listen to for halfanhour but dreadful to endure for any larger portion of ones natural life his conduct moreover is not at all in keeping or upon a par with that of ordinarily decent persons of his ser and the presence of the naughty italian woman under the same roof with his wife is an offence against goodbreeding and good taste which would be simply impossible in real life on the part of such a character the secretdoor in tile library is unworthy the writers inventive power and indeed the whole conception of the incidents to which it leads is faulty and improbable but that portion of barbaras history which occurs previous to her removal from her aunt mrs shakeshaft of stonycroft hall is charmingly told amidst glimpses of english scenery that discover the artist in the author and make those who most desire her success long to find her writing a story that shall rely wholly upon its vraisemblance to realities the most original and bestsustained character in the volumes before us is mrs shakeshaft and wve quite regret to lose her wholly in the second volume and to hear so little of her in the third as for barbaras family the whole might be left out of the book without causing any loss to its interest and with the exception of professor metze the german school is as unproductive of character yet with all its shortcomings barbaras history is replete with evidences of the authors talent clever and brilliant dialogues graphic descriptions of scenery and places with little ripples of wit scintillating here and there and frequent eloquence of language characterise these volumes which have the virtue of retaining the readers interest to the end  barbaras history rn by amelia b edwards tc 3 vols hurst  blackett if miss amelia edwards goes on writing such stories as barbaras history she will on some bright day of a lucky season wake up and find herself famous she hos made great progress since the publication of  the story of cervantes and her other books for children the patient labour of a long apprenticeship has not been without good results to the artist for now that she undertakes to amuse a superior and more critical clas3 of readers she brings to the task qualities necessary for the satisfactory completion of an imaginative work seldom if ever found in inexperienced essayists miss edwards however has qualities superior to mere literary facility and acquaintance with the artifices of her art she has humour insight into character a somewhat extensive knowledge of books and a mind thoroughly feminine in tone but strong enough to pass through fields of thought without leaning on a more powerful intellect wishing to do the lady justice we lay especial stress on our recognition of her strength and ability to stand alone  for while we give her full credit for having written a thoroughly readable and at some points deeply interesting nnovel we may not omit to state that she is greatly indebted to others for the plot principal characters and general tone of her book we tread on delicate ground and are anxious to avoid misconstruction no eharge of plagiarism is either made or insinuated in what has just escaped us it is quite possible that whilst the author was thinking out her story during quiet country walks and in the silent hours of sleepless nights she never gave a single thought to  david copperfield and  jane eyre a clever shy ugly awkward child of a poor proud selfish gentleman barbara churchill is sent from her dull london schoolroom into suffolk where the little girl has an eccentric aunt named ann shandyshaft a lady of landed property whose whims create laughter for miles around her residence stoneycroft hall the little girls journey from town to suffolk her reception at stoneycroft hall and the character of her relation are extracts from  david copperfield  with a difference little barbaras adventure with the dissenting minister who devours her sandwiches whilst the hungry child looks on feeling herself wronged but unable to defend her rights recalls the scene between david and though waiter in the coffeeroom where the latter drinks off the little fellows ale this is only one of many points of resemblance between barbaras history and copperfields experiences the aunts of the two children are distinguishable only by difference of income and social positionmiss ann shandyshaft being a much grander and wealthier personage than miss betsy trotwoodand by a diversity of taste which impels the latter lady to hunt donkeys and the former to drive pigs the intercourse of the one aunt with her nephew closely resembles that of the other lady with her niece it is however needless to enforce a parallel between the two ladies it is enough to say that it exists and then leave readers to detect for themselves the points of similarity adjoining the estate of stoneycroft hall are the domains of hugh farquhar a gentleman of vast powers and wasted opportunities hugh has travelled read suffered much and scandalised society a good deal more when little barbara crosses his path but though he has seen much of the world he is still a young man his country neighbours think he ought to marry and settle amongst them  but the owner of eleven thousand a year is of another opinion he is a gentleman who scorns social trammels and it is delicately hinted that he nurses a secret sorrow after a years stay in suffolk barbara and the two other principal characters of the tale are separatedaunt shandyshaft sending the child home to her harsh father and hugh farquharthe superb the sumptuous mysterious hughtaking his secret sorrow and flashing eyes to foreign landa after a while barbara is sent to a german college where she distinguishes herself as an artist from this point of the book almost to the end of the story mr dickenss influence ceases to make itself felt and the author works away under inspiration drawn from charlotte brontes nnovels the life of the german college is the college life of villettewith a difference  barbara no longer a feminine edition of david copperfield becomes a refined spiritualized jane eyre  and hugh farquhar who unexpectedly makes his appearance at the college plays the part of mr rochesteralso with a difference the girl and the man fall fiercely in love with each other but instead of throwing himself at her feet and asking for her hand he strives against a love in the gratification of which lies his only chance of happiness the secret sorrow already hinted at the black mysterious trouble of his days forbids him to make the girl his wife at length the offer is made and he is accepted  but even after matters have reached that point hugh farquhar flies from barbara not daring to marry her in defiance of principle of course the reader assumes that like mr rochester hugh farquhar is already married unable to live away from weird little barbara the tempestuous lover returns and they are married a period of continental travel succeeds the ceremony and after a while hugh reluctantly consents to return to england and settle with his young wife at broomhill as soon as she has entered the old mansion barbara begins to suspect that it contains secret apartments from which she is excluded and a mysterious occupant of those apartments whose acquaintance she is not permitted to make time and accident convert suspicion into knowledge barbara ascertains that a lnovely woman is kept in the house of which she herself is mistressa woman of whom her husband has never made mention this is the most exciting part of the story first the reader suspects that hugh like mr rochester has a mad wife shut up in his house then that the mysterious lady is a mistress whom he dares to cherish under the same roof with his wife barbara and hugh at length come to an understanding about the mysterious ladythe husband telling his wife a rigmarole little calculated to impose on so j clever a woman and barbaraclever woman and jealous wife though she isaccepting the flimsy statement but the fire is only deadened i not quenched ere long barbara passing along a gallery overhears her husband in private conversation withins beautiful lodger they are sitting together like lovers the lnovely italian woman is passionately reminding hugu of her devotion to him and declaring that barbara will never love him as she maddalena has loved and still loves him pleasant talk this for poor barbara a minute later she hears hugh address the woman as  poa mia barbara stays to listen no longer that same night she flies from broomhill and after sickness and peril makes her way to rome eventually a reconciliation is effected between barbara and her husband  and in order that the heroine may not be censured for pardoning the man who appears to have put upon her the worst affront husband can offer to wife miss edwards covers her hero with so thick and complete a coating of whitewash that there ia not enough darkness left to account for what has taken place in the story it is shown that hugh never married maddalenathe reader thereby learning that his indignation against mr farquhar as a bigamist has been murplaced and that in addition to the pleasurable excitement of reading a good bigamy case he has also the pleasure of discovering that the supposed criminal is innocent the whitewashing goes on it is shown that hugh cannot be said even to have seduced maddalenaaye more that he cannot be said even to have loved her true he was his mistress many years before his marriage  but he was drawn into the affair by pity not love for the woman who threw herself at his feet vowing that she idolised him the process of whitewashing is not yet done it is shown that hugh would have married her if he could have done so  but as her existing marriage with an aged and repulsive husband prevented him from taking that step he promised her never to marry any other woman it is proved also that hugh had long since ceased to give maddalena any special signs of personal favour  and therefore that though he was guilty of indiscretion in harbouring her in though same house with his wife he had in no way been false to his marriage vows it does not seem to strike miss edwards that the statements of this whitewashing part are not only inconsistent with her characters but break down the entire framework of her story it is not very probable that a fastidious refined and highly sensitive mana man without any alloy of physical or moral weaknesswould live with any woman under the circumstances described from motives of commiseration  sensitive men do not love women who throw themselves at their feet and play the part of whipped spaniels licking thc dust off their masters shoes it is simply incredible that a keen flippant sarcastic sceptic like hugh could have bound himself to such a worshipper by an unsought promise never to marry another woman  and even if in a moment of weakness he had given such a promise he most ussuredly would not have regarded it as a valid obligation years after relinquishing personal intercourse with the dishonoured beauty again if that had been the true story of his intimacy with maddalena what reason was there for keeping the matter from barbaras knowledge after he bad married her in fact the apology does too much bringing down the entire structure of the tale with a crash let us however say that we like missedwards all the better for her error con senting to humour the existing taste for bigamy stories she was determined not to make too great a sacrifice of womanly dignity for a consideration she would touch pitch  but pitch white and perfumedpitch which ehe might lay aside with clean hands just as mrs ratcliffe used to season her stories with the requisite amount of ghostly horrors capable of explanation in the last chapter so has miss edwards effected a compromise between her own sense of right and the depraved appetite of the public giving zest to her romance by the introduction of a bigamist who as the curtain falls is proved to be a man of exemplary character what her story loses by this compromise the personal character of the lady gains whether it will not be best for her both as a woman and an artist to have no further transactions with white pitch is a question which she will do well to put to herself,novel
the manxman mr hall caines new nnovel like the greater part of his work indeed has one special and noticeable quality it forces you to feel how straight out of his heart he writes a few other writers of fiction today may have equal emotional intensity but they are either careful to hide it or unable to express it he backs up this warmth of feeling by much else it is trueby humour by observation by excellent workmanship the manxman is a very full book fuller even than the deemster and  the bondman appealing to varied interests expending a lavish amount of material and showing no thinness or flimsiness anywhere still its special power over readers is emotional a power great and dangerous his keen appreciation of humour may generally be trusted to keep this other and stronger quality within bounds but one lights on a spot now and again where the atmosphere is sickly because the wholesome airs of humour have ceased for the moment to blow the nnovel is a tribute to his beloved island warmer even than  the deemster to the character of its people  the manxman by hall caine 6s heinemann to the picturesqueness of their simple lives it is in a sense a book of manx folklore and the descriptions of old rites and customs are the occasions of some of the most striking passages though one must admit that the artist has been driven too much by the patriot there is more of this lore than the story strictly needs the construction of the book is of the careful gradual order each important step beirg noted each phase in the life of the chief actors minutely examined care and conscientiousness it should be said mark every page it is to the first part descriptive of the early lives of philip christian the central personage and his humble cousin pete the hero that one looks back with keenest pleasure philip though an orphan lives a sheltered comfortable life while pete is a povertystricken neglected little urchin with no legal right to philips family name but the lads are staunch allies and the tale of their imaginary adventures as desperadoes the terror of all the islands is a charming bit of boylore  pete said philip with awful gravity  the seas calling me  and me said pete solemnly early that night the two lads were down at the most desolate part of port mavar in a cave under the scraggy black rocks of gobnygarvain kindling a fire of gorse and turf inside the remains of a broken barrel see that tremendous sharp rock below low water said philip  dont i though said pete there was never a rock the size of a currycomb between them and the line of the sky  thats what we call a reef said philip  wait a bit and youll see the ships go splitting on top of it likelike  like a taypot said pete well save the women though said philip shall we save the women pete we always do  aw yes the womenand the boys said pete thoughtfully philip had his doubts about the boys but he would not quarrel it was nearly dark and growing very cold the lads croodled down by the crackling blaze and tried to forget that they had forgotten teatime 1 we never has to mind a bit of hungry said philip stoutly never a haporth said pete only when the jobs done we have hams and flitches and things for supper  aw yes ateing and drinking to the full  rum pete we always drinks rum we has to said pete none of your tea said philip coorse not none of your old grannys twopenny tea said pete pete loves katherine the daughter of caesar  a mighty man among the methodists and a prosperous innkeeper and to win a home for her he goes to kimberley to make his fortune philip he appoints his doineymolla or manpraiser a post that demands intercession for the lover with the parents before betrothal and during the lovers absence attention to and protection of the lady philip has not allowed his education and conditions to separate him from his old comrade but his friendship does not protect him from temptation neither he nor katherine proves worthy of the guileless trust reposed in them pete comes home a rich man but not so rich in gold as in love for kate and his friend worldly prospects and the story of his own unequally mated father and mother keep philip from preventing the marriage but the woman unable long to bear her false position leaves her husband and is hid by ner old lover mr caine has attempted a great task in following the inner life of philip a man of sensitive soul of great talents and distinguished by fortune feeling himself every day more corrupted and degraded by a secret sin that brings him no gratification high or low the hunting of philip by his fortune and his conscience raises the book to a high tragic level kate in a sudden burst of unselfishness goes away but misfortune follows her and on her return she has to appear before philip the deemster on a charge of attempting her own life and is committed to gaol divorce proceedings with closed doors sever her from pete dis tinctions are showered on philip and his secret is safe but at the great ceremony of his appointment as governor he refuses the honour makes public confession goes to the prison and leads kate out a comparison here is inevitable the scene challenges comparison as voluntarily as do the turners hung side by side with the claudes in the national gallery if it is not longer than the one our mind reverts to it is too long and too unrestrained it does not thrill like  at last at last i stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward sustains me at this dreadful moment from grnovelling down upon my face  lo the scarlet letter which hester wears ye have all shuddered at it wherever her walk hath beenwherever so miserably burdened she may have hoped to find reposeit hath cast a livid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her but there stood one in the midst of you at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered  perhaps it is not comparison alone that harms it philips creator will have him expiate his sin to the last among those who had held him in honour and will have him marry katherine they walk out of the story with a halo but what of philips heritage of weakness that had already driven him to intemperance and in katherine there was no nobility hers is a poor nature capable of better moments sufring curbs passion and often refines human nature but it cannot essentially change it and readers interested in these two cannot leave them with the thought they have found peace they had both suffered enough to have paid the price of death for one at least philips story and petes character are the outstanding features of the book pete is a real creation humorous unconsciously poetical and of a trustfulness in a shaky world heartbreaking to behold when he knows not where kate has gone he invents sublime falsehoods to account for her disappearance and you never heard tell of him not uncle joey with the bald head well well  a smart old man though man alive the lively he is too and the laughable and the good company to look at that mans face youd say the sun was shining reglar aw

joe of scotland road down clarence dock way  to think of that now  they went off with looks of perplexity and pete turned into the house theyre trying to catch me theyre wanting to shame my poor hli kirry i must keep her name sweet he thought of the letters he wrote to himself it would have been enough to give us a hint there is in them too insistent an appeal to our feelings any one who reads mr hall caines book with the interest it deserves cannot be blind to its defects it is because it is so full of human kindness and imagination and by these takes hold of our affection that we canot be

  fiction sacred and profane love by arnold bennett chatto  windus os  mr bennett appears before the public in a dual capacityas a triter of lucrative trash and as an artist we have no concern with mr bennetts artistic conscience he knows what he is about better than most men in all he does that quality of assurance is manifest and he does nothing that is not good ot its kind his melodramas fantasias he is clever enough to call themcould not fail to satisfy the abandoned craving for sensation  his criticism should be better known than it is his essay on george moore in  fame and fiction  expresses one point of view with singular precision and some beauty his  a great man  has wit but his best up till now is undoubtedly to be found in  anna of the five towns  in  leonora and in his latest book which is now before us we feel that these are his work the others are simply turned off for amusement in leisure moments safetyvalves for his superfluous steam in  sacred and profane love  mr bennett has set himself a great task he narrates the three experiences of passion that have come into the life of a strong and beautiful womana character which any imaginative writer might well be proud to have created her name name is carlotta and she tells her own story the personal method of narration is in this case a necessity and is not thc least of the many difficulties that have beset mr bennetts path and over which he has triumphed by the power of his technique the chief difficulty however is to make the theme noble the least wavering or uncertainty of grip in the author and the theme of passion infallibly and swiftly becomes ignoble and sordid here again mr bennett has succeeded  he has created feeling that is intense enough and sincere enough to need no apology  but here also in our opinion lies the weak point of the book he has not sufficiently trusted to bis power to ennoble the theme on its own merits he has made use of artifice which was not necessary for him he has no need to make the lover diaz a worldfamed pianist by so doing he weakens the essential by introducing an element of improbability into the opening phase of the book and again at the end the emotional intensity is lowered and not heightened to climax by the superficial pomp of diazs triumph in the paris operahouse a weaker writer would have had need for all the glitterand tinsel which he could command mrbennett has not tinsel merely serves to obscure the large humanity of his treatment conspicuous when carlotta steals down into the hall of the hotel in the early morning and bus the boatshaped straw hat from the servant girl and comes in contact with the people starting for their work on her journey home conspicuous too throughout the second part and especially in the scenesplendidly dramaticbetween carlotta and mrs ispanlove a weak whimpering woman who rouses all the pity in the strong heart of carlotta conspicuous in the character of the very old man lord alcar these are touches of genius  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett chatto  windus there is not very much sacred love in mr bennetts nnovel which is obviously inspired by a study of modern frenoh fiction the story is told in the first person by miss carlotta peel whose career is one must hope unusual in the first chapters we find her a victim to the celebrated pianist diaz on the first occasion of their meeting later she becomes the mistress of a publisher who issues her books for she is a popular writerindeed we gather a famous writer since when she again encounters diar he knows of her repute the publisher on hearing that his wife has committed suicide blows out his brains but carlotta undismayed continues her career of sacred or profane love  whichever mr bennett calls it diaz has unhappily become a dipsomaniac but she heroically redeems him from his degrading vice and writes the libretto of an opera which startles paris and then she dies what mr bennett means if he means anything it is hard to discover his tale reads like a parody of a french nnovel and at times is positively grotesque certainly if it has been his object to depict the amours of an illregulated woman he has failed to realise her for us carlotta is only such a woman as seen from the outside by mr bennett and as composed by him from imagination she never convinces us and though the ways of women are well known to be inscrutable they are not so unnecessarily wanton as hers this is how she explains herself to the publisher but it does not seem to advance us much  for me there are two beingsmyself and the observer of myself it is the nnovelists disease this duplication of personality when i said illusion i meant the supreme illusion of love is it not an illusionwill it last who knows by that time carlotta ought to have had a shrewd suspicion it would not  sacred and profane love by arnold bennett i chatto and windus in one wvay  sacred and profane love  seems to us a nnovelty in english fiction the heroine is a woman who errs willinglyxultingly yet mr arnold bennett neither excuses her apologises for her moralises over her nor punishes her ihe lets her tell her

forward to the appearance ot thensuccessors with confidence knowing that at any rate tney would be treated to compositions calculated to preserve w dignity of the art of fiction besides their general

simple plot with a remarkable degree of interest the merit of the book really lies in it3 artistic working out of details and characters the personages are few in number but they are all clearly defined and realisable by the reader as flesh and blood and not as names or wooden puppets linley rochford the beautiful heroine is as charming a girl as we have met with for a long time and so well is she drawn that we are inclined to think we should immediately know her were we to go fr to the street and meet ber tomorrow she lived at bonn with her two maiden aunts keeping school till mr rochford met her and bore her off as his bride she was at that interesting period only nineteen years of age and ker husband just doubled her in years coming to live in mr rochfords fine old house at

the direst poverty to one of great wealth and who aro not ashamed to acknowledge their origin mr platt afterwards succeeds in representing his native town in parliament all the persons just mentioned are however subsidiary to linley her husband and his friend koche valentine a man who is in danger of being lost to the world for lack of a serious purpose in life but we are forgetting the main drift of the story little by little poor linley discovers the absolute selfishness of her husbands heart and finally is forced to the conclusion that she never possessed his affections on one occasion she found him leaning over the sofa and breathing passionate words to cynthia courcelles whom he had previously professed to love she had been thrown from her horse and rochford concocted a story which for some time satisfied his wife but a more wretched incident followed rochford made love to ihe very girl whom linley had redeemed from squalor and misery and the treacherous woman accepted his professions this determined the injured wife whose affection for her husband had completely died tut and she prepared to leave him and to return to bonn lone and poor as she came that same night

the wifes evidence by w g wills 3 vols j hurst  blackett i in the wifes evidence there are the materials for an excellent nnovel of strong interest j if the author would only have told his tale quietly and steadily the subject is unhackneyed and there are skill and originality in  building up the incidents and drawing the i characters but the author loses time and space by indulging in declamatory bits of elo quence and in the desire to be dramatic he  has weakened the effect of a story sufficiently remarkable to need no adventitious aid of rhetoric the outline of the tale is briefly as follows a son long estranged from home by a quarrel with his father has married made his own way in the world and been for some time successful as a literary man and editor of a journal he is however at the opening of the story on the verge of bankruptcy the first scenes are merely introductory to show the character of the man and the nature of the charming good wisehearted wife whom he is so fortunate as to possess screening her brother who having been his confidential clerk had embezzled a large sum of money has been the real cause of colemans embarrassments and nearly of his disgrace coleman will not disclose the secret of a man whom he has pardoned and who is repenting his crime but his wife proves the facts and his good name is cleared the wilful character of the man in adhering to a course of action he has once adopted is well illustrated in these preliminary scenes but they are too long and too minutely drawn out they detain the reader from the main interest of the tale after the affairs of the bankruptcy are wound up coleman his wife and child go into somersetshire to stay with his mother now a widow and sole mistress of the paternal acres her character is well and clearly drawn full of good sense and geniality she has also a vein of fierce untractable matteroffact implacability lying beneath the surface mother and son resemble each other in their dogged tenacity of purpose she and her son have never been estranged all these years they have been in regular correspondence and on his fathers death she would have had him home only that he was then following his own career in london she receives him and his wife with a hearty welcome whilst little johnny their son is the delight of her heart the return to the old home and the description of the life there led are well done the character of coleman is well developed with his quaint genial humour his tenderness for his wife and the gnarled perverse knot of obstinacy in his nature with which only his wife can deal domesticated in the family they find the farm bailiff a rude florid coarse goodlooking man who had become manager of the farm on the death of the husband when coleman could not or would not return to take his own place as head of the family in the years that have elapsed the bailiff has secured his influence and coleman discovers that his mother is on the brink of marrying him fondly hoping that they may still continue to live together as a happy family all this story is well and skilfully told the scene between mother and son is extremely good and the character of the old woman is very true to human nature when her son reproaches her with disrespect to his fathers memory lowe your father nothingshe said your father did me a mean turn which i have not forgotten and shant forget to my dying day your aunt dora could tell you all about it its no matter no matter but you have minded me of a good reason for what i mean to do for gods sake what has my father done mother which could influence you to sacrifice yourself i always believed that you and my father lived happily eh dear happily that is the happiness i never talk of injustice or wrongs but i dont think of em the less not much happened since then in this quiet house to put em out of my mind then to the quiet astonishment of her son who scarcely trusted his ears she gave him the history with feminine bitterness and detail of a certain velvet mantle which her husband had long promised her and made a deal of fuss about when it arrived she could have put a piedish under cither shoulder it was such an illfit and she wished to have it sent back and altered what do you think he did will he tumbled the mantle into its box and sent it off as a present to your aunt dora the woman of all the world i hate the most and he told me to my face a few days after that he had heard from her to say it was a good fit for her i have done him many a kind turn since that will and i sat up for six nights with him when he wab dying without ever taking off my clothes but i tellee i was thinking of that drees when i looked from my window and saw the velvet on his hearse with all this implacability there is a simple straightforwardness in the old lady which wins the readers sympathy shemarries the bailiff with a guileless trust that is almost heroic of course though natural result followshe has married her for her money and proves a coarse tyrant her son and his wife stay beside her to shield and comfort her and to be ready to take her away when she is willing to go but the catastrophe comes quickly personally illused her husband drawing all her hardlysaved money and squandering it in riotous living bringing his mistress into the house the wretched old woman is maddened with indignation one night coming home drunk after a lengthened absence he insults her beyond her power to endure he reels upstairs to bed and she fetches a hatchet and murders him in his sleep her son hearing a noise goes to her room and finds her standing with the hatchet in her hand the necessity for action the instinct to saare his mother at whatever cost prompt him to take measures which have the effect of involving him in a aveb of suspicious and incriminating circumstances his avife who alone could have given the information which avould have cleared him is kept by him out of the way at the coroners inquest the result is that he is committed for trial along with the old lady as guilty of the murder he then deliberately resolves to sacrifice himself his wife and child and to save his mother a wife cannot give evidence in a criminal case either for or against her husband eleanors despair her efforts her baffled endeavours to make the truth heard are well described but in the last volume the style is throughout declamatory and rhetorical which aveakens the effect the quietest and most steady avriting was needed to make the working out of colemans fanaticism probable or pleasant he prefers his mother to his avise and child and having decided to save her it needed great delicacy and good management on the part of the author to carry the sympathy of the reader with him but he wastes all his strength to illustrate the hardship of the law that prevents a wife bearing testimony for her husband and to this purpose the symmetry and strength of the nnovel is sacrificed coleman trifles with his avife deceives her keeps her at arms length and behaves to her in a manner entirely unworthy of her faithfulness and courage the whole of the last volume is hurried there is a want of good workmanship which is the more provoking as the author has shown himself quite capable of the mechanism of his craft all that passes after the trial is weak and confused a condemned murderer is not allowed to leave his cell and go out into the avorld on a mere  reprieve the statement of the old lady given under the influence of an overdose of laudanum would have required corroboration and her confession is so hazy that it reads more like the murmuring of delirium than a definite statement the scene between eleanor and her husband in prison when she brings him the good news is feeble and unsatisfactory the author appears to have become weary of his task or else to have considered it unnecessary to finish up his work in a businesslike manner he gives all his care and attention to the sensation scenes instead of considering his work as a whole the character of michael the irish retainer is clever and his mode of dealing with the witnesses is amusingly characteristic but there is too much of him and he is too stagey to touch the sympathy of the reader the author of the wifes evidence is capable of writing a powerful wellsustained nnovel and we hope he will give us one that will do justice to his talent,novel

1 kissing the rod a nnovel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth nnovel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the nnovel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lnovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends who were neither slow nor cold in recognising the merits of his earlier stories and who sincerely regret the imperfections of his present book he clearly stands in need of repose and we urge him to rest now so that heand wemay be thankful for better work hereafter,novel
a question of honour a nnovel by wcosmo monkhouse 3 vols chapman  hall that mr cosmo monkhouse is not disposed to underrate the quality of his nnovel we gather from the dedicatory lines to a friend  whose subtle spirit doth so charge the air of the authors most fortunate being that whatever berry he plucks is forthwith transformed to ripe and luscious fruit with arrogant sentimentality the nnovelist continues take thou this shock of sheaves with thine own light made sweet anti good grain fruit and metalberries corn and crock take all for barren hid i boen mid rude but for thy gentler growths upon the rock grain and fruit are words that accord with our nnovelists boastful metaphor but a shock of sheaves  is certainly not a thing in whih we should expect to find as matters of course some nuggets of metal and an eavtlnrn pot moreover upon close examination of mr morehouses shock of sheaves we fail to discover in them a single ear or kernel of grain like the bundles of straw occasionally put before theatrical scenes for stageeffect they are sham sheaves consisting of straw out of which every seed of corn lias been thrashed were it not for a vague impression that we have seen the authors name on a titlepage in former times we should not hesitate to speak of the story as a first attempt in a department of art for which the writer has not a single qualification and just so much education that he can string together english words with a lair degree of grammatical correctness and an appearance of facility out of tender heed for the sensitiveness of youth we will however disregard this vague impression and giving mr monkhouse the benefit of the doubt will deal tenderly with him as a youngster who after the wont of in experience has mistaken the nature and direction of his capabilities it is not only at the outset of life that men are found toiling along roads that can only lead them to disappointment and defeat middle age abounds with its victi ns of misdirected ambitionthe dreary  gentlemen whose dullness would escape ridicule if thy were not always attempting to be witty   and brilliant dancers of the splayfooted and  perspiring sort who are

carpet of the club whistroom in the unconsciousness of intoxication and is finally laid in that rather ignominious state on the doorstep of his residence where he is taken upstairs and put into safe quarters by his miserable little wife here anhow is enough of incident for a first chapter or as mr monkhouse would put the case enough of  grain fruit and metal berries corn and creek for a single sheaf of a large shock but the story that at though outset thus promises to bo whit the advertisers arc pleased to call a  tale of incident soon stops gasping for want of breath after which it never recovers its original alarming velocity or even manages to get along at a brisk walkingpace what the narrative is all about we should not like to say for though we have perused every one of its pages and done our honest best to master their contents wo cannot tell why it is called a question of honour or why it was not called a question of dishonour which so far as we are able to judge of what we confess we know very little about would have been a more appropriate title in fact the book is a labyrinth of sentences out of which few readers will find their way by the path which the author wishes them  and that it should be thus characterised by maziness no one is likely to feel surprise after reading one of the authors theories respecting the labour of literary composition mr monkhouse maintains that if an educated man will only work himself into a fierce excitement and during the full violence of his agitation will put words upon paper the words will be necessarily pregnant with

new nnovels the rebel queen by walter besant 3 vols chatto  windus the jew is undoubtedly having his day in literature and more particularly in fiction for at no previous time were so many books consecutively produced dealing in sympathetic mood with jewish character customs and religion scores of narratives documents romances and dramas have been issued by jew and gentile with varying guarantees of competence and authority and simultaneously the fervid hebraistic spirit itself has been revealed in a diary a correspondence an autobiography or a volume of poetry the distinctive mark of all this contemporary literature is its attraction and glow it does not arouse the old prejudice or tempt any man outside germany to stir up tue old scorn and bigotry against a sealed and despised race in england at any rate the race is no longer despised and enlightened men and women are more careful to separate the usurer the sweater the bester of his fellow men from the nobler and more spiritual types of jewish character and about these latter types a tolerant and somewhat sentimental age is curious to know all the facts that any one is in a position to tell it the reader who desires to get at the root of the matter naturally feels safest in the hands of hebrews born and bred an english romancer may have any amount of discrimination and literary expression and yet be unable to teach us what we can learn from the outpourings of a highstrung girl like amy levy or the observations of a caudid writer like mr zangwill whose latest contribution to the topic we notice below but it is not surprising that nnovelists so keen and sagacious as mr grant allen and mr walter besantnot to go back earlier than the present year  should take the jew into account or utilise him as a model for lofty and genial characterization and for disquisitions on physiology philosophy and the religion of the future in mr besants able story the rebel queen and most of the other characters are jews of a more or less estimable sort and the queen mothers repudiated husband is a latterday prophet who always occupies himself with stupendous thoughts and who is occasionally impressive the reader need not take him to be intended to be a man of strictly original ideas even when he contemplates the abolition of war by one or two applications of an irresistible destructive agency or when he insists that  there are no dead because well because of transmigration and the endless consequences of human action mr besant has been at great pains to study the jewish race he is exceptionally qualified for the task and he believes that  a new consideration of the law which they have so faithfully followed must soon be forced upon the world and may possibly solve some of its pressing difficulties meanwhile there is no doubt about the interest which the author of 4 the rebel queen has contrived to throw around his plot or about the glamour of his youthful jewesses,novel
a sturdy beggar and lady brambers ghosts bv charles charrington 3 6d a constable everything is better here than the stories though these will be found good enough if their accompaniments be appreciated mr charringtons talent lies in the direction of a criticism of life and into the mouth of a madman and of a highly eccentiic person he puts original views that we think very sane and are undoubtedly very interesting  a sturdy beggar  deals with the relations between the artist and the vulgar world the artist is the royal personage who graciously consents to be provided for the sturdy beggar with no sense of shame at the airangement  you might as well try to harmonise reason with religion as work with art a few will here applaud to others it should be explained that the speaker is an escaped lunatic in lady brambers ghost  there is the exposition of a theory as interesting a good deal more practical and very reconciling to many distutbed spirits the ghost is a man of genius with an unfortunate personality that impresse everyone with its feebleness a strange chance led him to do the literary work of a woman of great reputation she has a personality that impresses everyone by its strength and a great talent for exploitation he sustains her reputation for the reward of one hundred pounds a year and is perfectly satisfied with the arrangement which is the secret of successful artistic work he thinks  there have always been the exfloiter and the worker says the ghost  every minute taken up in exploiting ones work is taken from the work itself and the wisest way to prevent such a grievous waste is to give the worker the privilege of anonymity practically this has been done the real work has always been accomplished long before it becomes connected with any mans name and by the time a great exploiter poet statesman or inventor is born he has only to associate his own personality with something conceived long ago by men whose names never travel down to posterity there may be faults in the stories insanity is a quite needless excuse for the utterance of unaccepted truths and it is made use of in both but we can stand even more faults if mr charrington continue to stir ideas into his work as he has done here,novel
the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the nnovel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the nnovel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the time watched by three brahmin priests in disguise at the taking of seringapatam john hernoastle an english officer is met by one of his relations at the treasury of the palace and under rather suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about the place he starts for the neighbouring town a few miles off and deposits the moonstone with a banker there by the time the birthday iarrives rachel has refused another cousin godfrey ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them sergeant cuff an eminent detective is brought down friud london but rachel refuses to give him any information and strange to say she completely onto her old lover and will hold no communication with him sergeant cuffs suspicions point to rachel herself he thinks that she has used the diamond for the purpose of raising motey to pat her debts and thae she has been aided by rosanna spearman one of the servants a deformed girl who had been brought up as a thief and whom lady verinder had received from a reformatory xnny circumstances point to rosainna as the guilty person the newlypainted door leading to rachels sittingroom has bean smeared and the smear must have been made by thi thiin the night clothing of all the servante is found eorredt but rosanna is known to have purchased sode cloth at the vtiaseand to have been engaged in her own room making aomethi in addition the detective discover that she bhs bought a tin box and chain and sinks them i the shivering sads on th coast and not far from the house this box the egeda it assured contains the uightgou of the guilty penrsn bdsasspearman however commits suicide and the detectivle is at length dismissed by lady verinder leaving the mysterj unexplained in time however all is cleared up a oommunicative assistant to a country doctor had whilst his master wine delirious taken down his ravings and got at the fact that one of the gentlemen at the birthday dinnerpartywe will not disclose the authors secret by saying whowas drugged with opium the assistant is of opinion and finds his view fortified by a passage from carpenters

tried in the presence of witnesses and a sham diaeod is tva in the same way that the real one had been but be d affording some proof not very strong that the suspeted indivml was not a thief the meas adopted are rsultflss as the sleoini drops the piece of glass upon the floor and sinks off to shop rachels solicitor andl friend 3fr bruff however has good reason for suspecting that the diamond has been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other nnovels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old steward had less to say about robinson crusoe miss clacks narrative is intended to convey the idea of a meddlesome fanatic but it is merely a broad burlesque of the character,novel

  the coming of theodora by eliza orne white smith elder this american writer has a fine respect for the facts of life and character she knows that there are natures charged with no matter what virtues that will never be attracted to each other but will ever be at war and her nnovel is a clever illustration of that melancholy human fact theodora has all the virtues and if very few of the instinctive graces she has what even few very virtuous persons possess humility and magnanimity she is in fact a trump you cannot but like her and you would dread her approach as you would an earthquake into the charming topsyturvy peaceful and amusing household of her brother she brings orderand rebellion though her every word and thought and act are generous the extreme unselfishness and the extreme insensitiveness of theodora are set out in a masterly way and we end by feeling a real tenderness for her though as a companion and helpmate she continues difficult but she was not quite so impossible perhaps as she grew to think herself disappointment made her morbid and this woman with a genius for  managing refused the man she loved because acceptance would have meant the bringingup of a child who objected to her she always did things thoroughly we had never thought to have seen the pathetic side of a capable strongwilled manager but miss orne white was wiser,novel
patience sparhawk and her times by gertrude atherton 65 lane try to conceive  the story of an african farm 0 without its passion for morality and you will get some idea of mrs athertons new book it is the nnovel of a clever woman of overflowing energy and burning interest in life but it is terribly crude and to european eyes terribly solemn with the aggressive solemnity of youth primarily it is a protest against the tame american nnovel and a claim that the people of the united states are very independent in ideals and conduct and very much themselves patience is a defiant portrait of a defiant woman to the mere reader she is a conceited badtempered and vulgar person a not unnatural product of a shocking bringing up but her creator proudly shows her with the manhood of new york at her feet paying her outrageously illbred compliments the refreshing thing about patience is her strong belief in the sanitary influence of brains which have been rather underrated by heroines of her order in recent fiction mrs atherton we are sure is not her apologist she likes her just sodefiant rasping grasping flattery and powerperhaps wishes she were worse but seeing she is neither exemplary nor charming a reader who cares more for general human nature than for any temporary phase of the american woman will ask what is the good of her to him her career is spasmodically interesting the society scenes we cannot accept as true to life but her experience among the temperance women and the newspaper men are at least very lively as a story however we own our real interest was first roused when bourke on his engine was racing the new york express with the confession which was to save patience from a criminals death in the electrical chair altogether it is a book that interests us more in its writer than in itself all the characters who have anything to say talk essays by this means mrs atherton has got rid of much matter weighing on her mind and so presumably she will move along more swimmingly next time  fiction patience sparhawk and her times by n gertrude atherton john lane dubing these two or three years certain social sketches published in vanity fair over the signature of mrs atherton have indicated the settlement in our midst of an american writer of much promise now comes the nnovel it cannot be denied that upon the whole the promise is fulfilled in one of its many aspects the book invites and indeed deserves ridicule it is ridiculous as the embodiment of mrs athertons philosophical proposition about the women of america these dames and damsels may really be struggling to be free from the conventions which keep society decent and girlhood charming but we cannot believe that they will ever as a class settle down into the humourless hetairism in which practically all the characters of this book spend the mid period of the romance mrs athertons philosophy of the american woman need not however trouble us long it springs from an excess of zeal and may be overlooked the story itself is fresh and arresting patience sparhawk is at school when we make her acquaintance her father is dead and her mother is given to drink and wantoning and young as she is patience who has a sensitive soul is bitterly at issue with the world dreary this state of affairs undoubtedly is but it is treated with extraordinary skill so keenly sympathetic is mrs athertons study of the strange rural life in america that we follow her for many chapters with a very unusual interest her perceptions are acute and her reflections are extraordinarily well phrased nor does the work fall off when having tried to kill her mother patience leaves home for the great city there she is taken charge of by two maiden relations whose evangelical activities george eliot herself could scarce have depicted with finer art meanwhile patience has been developing her spanish nature has blossomed into a critical reticent hauteur and she has become beautiful there ends mrs athertons essay in real literature the lovemaking and the wedlocks which follow will not bear examination the book reveals an unusual perspicacity as regards women but mrs athertons men are not good with the exception of the two editors under whose joint auspices patience becomes a  newspaper woman the male characters in the book are unnatural finally being suspected of having poisoned her husband patience is condemned to death thereupon the nnovelist finds her proper pace again and the pace is rapid times without record the same situation has been made use of by sensational writers but we should be surprised to learn that it has ever been more effectively treated than it is in this nnovel the narrative flies before our eyes as fast as the special ttain which is bearing the reprieve and a new lover to the gaol in which the heroine is about to be  electrocuted it is not literature of a high kind  but such ns it is it is brilliant,novel

sense and sensibility by jank ai sten richard bentley new burlington street this reprint of miss fane austens excellent work forms no xxiii of the standard nnovels the best critique of the work itself will be found in thc wellwritten preface but as we wish all to read that anti the nnovel too that read our notice we shall make a few brief but sincere remarks of high praise upon the publication before us this nnovel we have always held to be one of the best if not the very best of its class chaste yet witty it can boast of excessive purity without tininess turns morality into lnoveliness anti proves religion to be the very highest state of mortal enjoyment this work is the voice of innocencelow vet beautifully distinct from its excessive sweetness anti so persuasive that we feel assured it can come only from the seclusion where vice has never dared to enter and where it fails to make a proselyte it must fall upon a heart unwin thy to enjoy what is beautiful anti unable to

construction her incidents in the common course of things and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation the story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases there are no exaggerations and no deficiencies and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fullness of the effect is produced the persons described are such as we meet every day in society but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of actionthe one illustrating the otherand moreover most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates self is a great disturber of the observing faculties in miss austens nnovels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world and free from the engrossment of acting a part in it we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked the commonplace characters of the town and the village are the characters which miss austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood in the story before us what an example of the worthless is mr johii dashwoodnot the wormhless in the common acceptation of the word implying positive vice but the worthless negative of worth of which common character miss austen has evinced a perfect comprehension and presented various illustrations mr john dashwood is incapable of a generous sentiment or a benevolent action but he is a rigid olserver of all the laws of the world and we know full well that so really despicable a man would pass as a very pattern of proprietya model man he has a wife all selfishness and worldliness who draws the pale of humanity round her own house to whom he looks up as he must to some one being of a parasitical genus with veneration consecrating all her foibles and almirilngly magnifying her littleness for one traitthe brother of this paragon marries beneath him as the world calls it though in this as in many other cases so described the match was an equal one for two narrow souls were attracted by the sympathy of meanness and literally contracted to each other the feelings of mrs john dashwood upon this trying occasion are described as follows by the adoring husbandwe think we hear the man speakas we read the letter and the very breaks are full of nature and denote the emphasis of his selfish concern your sister has suffered dreadfullyin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome poor fanny mrs john dashwood she was in hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much donovan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution elual to any thing she has born it all with the fortitude of an angel she says she never shall think well of any body again anl one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived csense and sensibility p 228 how exquisitely true to the sort of nature described is that unconscious satire  she has born it all unit the fortitude of an angel  she says she never shall think well of any body again angelic being mrs ferrars is another excellently drawn character one of those creatures cankered with wealth the tyrants of the moneybox the capricious despots of the last will and testament who make slaves of expectation and torment with fears of disappointment and cause the interested hopes of their death to be fraught with miseries and abasements during their lives her merit considered her perfection in one style miss austen is the worst appreciated nnovelist of her time she laboured under the disadvantage of ihaving the inferior stamp of circulatinglibrary popularity put upon her works before the superior judges had become acquainted with them and recognised their high degree of excellence the quarterly review to its honour be it remembered was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius it is remarkable that scott who noticed with praise many inferior authors never mentioned miss austen perhaps because she was not an inferior author perhaps for the same reason that caused sir walter to consider fieldings incomparable satire jonathan wild only as a story the present judicious blication is we see to be followed by  emma  northanier abbey  mansfield park and persuasion but suely it cannot be intended to omit  pride and prejudice which s at once the best and the most popular of the austen nnovels,novel

entered the park it now i wore its clearest coldest look the wind was howling an autumn dirge through the trees but the leaves that dropped so heavily and solemnly or floated for a moment in the air as if reluctantly submitting to their destiny seemed to have been stolen from them without its agency the drier heaps which nestled beneath caught as they were driven along some faint smile from the moon and seemed to linger an instant that they might enjoy it from the openings between the branches they could see a meadow covered with a thin filmy whiteness and here and there a few fawns crouching under some ancient elms that were thinly scattered around its extremities the night seemed to accord with tin tone of miss vyvyans conversation and honoria felt a painful pressure on her spirits but when she looked at the massy oaks whose broad arms seemed made to cast the shadows of the moonlightwhen she reached the hall and thought how much more venerable its cumbrous architecture looked for the darknesswhen she saw the sacred solemnity ofthe chapel liv its side she took comfort and asked herself why there may not be human characters which though no sunshine lighten or warm

a very successful commencement i am informed  did your lordship hear that from good authority  inquired mr nugent  from his uncle the india director he is a little partial i sup pose but a good sensible judge on the whole and has heard the best speeches of the day is your account different   i had the misfortune to be present and though i dare not set up my poor judgement in opposition to the canons of leadenhall street i must say that i would not again see a friend so expose himself for the world  is he a friend of yours  yes there are few men for whom i have more esteem  but i felt convinced that speaking was not win forte and last night he sadly confirmed my conjecture  did he actually break down or merely become confused as all young speakers according to mr fox should do on their first appearance  said mr harten field the honourable mr nugent looked somewhat restless for as he had not been the least confused on his first appearance but lad said off his speech as well as the bestprepared schoolboy he was somewhat perplexed to find that he lay under the ban of the greatest of modern orators his annoyance for himself did not increase his tenderness for his friend  i wish i could say that he replied  but i fear it must be pronounced a total failure the first lew minutes went off tolerably in spite of some ominous sentences about magnitude ofthe subject and consciousness of inability but when became to the argument  a failure there i should think very venial in a young orator said the nobleman  perhaps so only when a speaker introduces a syllogism in which the minor has no connexion with the major nor the conclusion with eitheror a dilemma of which both horns are equally innocentwe oxford members are apt to take the alarm however we might have

the wyvern mystery a nnovel new nnovels by j s le fanu 3 vols tinsley brothers much will not be said in behalf of  the wyvern mystery by those mild and commonplace people who think that a nnovel should aim rather at the exhilaration than the depression of the readers spirits that it should forbear to give pain which is not calculated to enhance the effect of its pleasurable representations that its illustrations of the evil should be put in contrast against equally vivid exhibitions of the good of human nature and that at the end it should leave the reader in the intellectual and moral condition of a man who has been listening to fiue music or contemplating a noble work of art or enjoying the stimulus of good company on the contrary by those many persons who delight in strong hysterical emotions and are of opinion that the romancewriter labours within the proper province of his art when he alternately freezes the readers heart and causes his hair to stand on end by pictures of eccentric vice and cruel violence a rush will be made to the libraries for the new tale of the nnovelist whose present performance surpasses all his previous wild stories in sensational inhumanity that the book overflows with cleverness and force no reader will deny but mr sheridan le fanu adds nothing to his reputation by another display of literary adroitness and melodramatic ability it must also be conceded that much labour has been expended on the first two volumes the separate parts of which are fitted together with the most precise and cunning workmanship and that the character of mildred tarnleythe faithful honest harsh old servingwoman who tells innumerable falsehoods in her masters service whilst she sharply censures his misconduct and sturdily declines to flatter himsecures the book from a charge of being altogether deficient in humour the naturalness of the other feminine characters is not conspicuous but the three principal men of the dramaold squire fairfield of wyvern and his two sonsare creatures of human flesh and blood surcharged with some of the most odious qualities of the race that they dishonour the harsh despotic scurrilous squire of wyvern a brute whose abusive tongue respects neither virtue nor the grave is not untrue to a period when englishmen of common stuff albeit of ancient pedigree used to think it a proof of manly spirit to bully their dependents and drink themselves at least once a day into stupefaction the disdainful abhorrence roused by the selfishness and moral imbecility of the squires elder son who by marrying alice maybell does her the greatest injury it is in his power to inflict upon her is evidence of the skill with which his despicable nature is portrayed and though harry fairfieldwho combines the smart  slanginess  of foker and the meanness of barnes newcome with the niggardliness of miser elwesis a more revolting specimen of the cheat sneak and cad than we have ever before encountered in prose fiction the picture of his loathsomeness does not surpass the bounds of possibility or even wander beyond the lines of experience the opening chapters of the narrative introduce the reader to alice maybell a fair and fortuneless beauty soon after her secret marriage with charles fairfield and to her patron the abusive old squire of wyvern who having in consideration of remote consanguinity extended patronage to her otherwise friendless infancy and girlhood is of opinion that the charming woman should reward his past kindness by consenting to be the wife of his failing years taking this view of her obligations the aged savage woos the frightened girl with a grotesque and boisterous amorousness that reminds us of squire westerns least delicate demeanour in the presence of ladies  and when alice escapes at the same time from his importunities and his house and flies with her bankrupt husband to a desolate and dilapidated old mansion not many miles distant from wyvern the furious dotard curses the pair with the choicest imprecations to be found in his comprehensive vocabulary of abuse and ere long he has grounds for flattering himself that his amiable wishes have not been ineffectual in carwell grange the miserable dwelling to which charles fairfield takes his bride even as a few years earlier he had brought the recentlydiscarded mistress who plays an important part in the drama alices life ia wretched and unseemly that he may not draw his impatient creditors upon him or reveal his lurkingplace to the emissaries of the woman who instead of consenting to her banishment from his presence declares that she is his wife the feeble and broken roui conceals himself from observation and forbids his bride to communicate to her nearest female friends their hidingplace at the grange their only servantsare mildred tarnley and a slatternly kitchen wench and for months their only visitor i harry fairfield who now and then rides over to carwell to eat and drink at his impoverished brothers expense to smoke the spendthrifts cigars and to urge him to proceed yet further on the road to ruin at length however another visitor arrives at the grange in the person of a blind and unspeakably hideous dutch woman named bertha velderkaust who effects an entrance into the mansion during charlesfairfields absence and whilst alice is in bed of berthas peculiarities it is enough to say that in addition to blindness and the disfigurements of smallpox they comprise a strong appetite for opium and brandy a temper given to maniacal ebullitions of rage and a demoniacal hatred of the woman who has supplanted her in her former paramours affections having contrived to enter the house and terrorised mildred tarnley into giving her a supper and bed this pleasant inmate for a quiet country hall instead of composing her weary limbs to rest makes the most of her nocturnal opportunity by cutting her way through a couple of papered and hidden doors into the sleepingroom of the young wife whose threshold shehas presumed to cross awakened by the intrusion but scared into dumbness alice by the faint rays of her nightlight sees the form face and outstretched hands of the furiouscreature who is bent on cutting her throat  the woman runs the narrative stood erect drawing a long breath holding her underlip slightly in her teeth with just a little nip she turned her face towards the bed and for the first time alice now quite distinctly saw it pale scarred with smallpox blind  still as death sat alice in her terror gazing into thesightless face of this woman little more than two yards removed from her suddenly this short space disappeared and with two swift step and an outstretched hand she stood at the bedside and caught alices nightdress and drew her forcibly towards her alice as violently resisted with a loud scream she drew back and the nightdress tore but the tall woman instantly grasped her nearer the shoulder and scrambling on the bed on bar knees she dragged her down upon it and almost instantly struck at her throat with a knife to make this blow she was compelled to withdraw one hand and with a desperate spring alice evaded the stroke through the intervention of timely aid alice escapes from her murderous assailant who is seized and consigned to the county prison where instead of exhibiting an anxiety for her own fate at the approaching assizes she vows vengeance on her former keeper whom she accuses of having committed bigamy but ere the wyvern  mystery can be unravelled by lawyers in a publio court the position of affairs is changed by the sudden death of charles wyvern shortly before alice gives birth to the boy with whose fortunes the remainder of the story principally concerns itself after charless death the interest of the tale sensibly diminishes and more than once in the course of the third volume the threads of the narrative seem to be falling from the weavers hand whilst he appears to be in doubt how to work them into an appropriate ending acting in harmony with his previous conduct harry fairfield gets possession of his brothers son puts him out of sight and makes alice believe that the little fellow is dead calling death to help him out of his perplexities the narrator kills old squire wyvern whose dying moments are worthy of the life that has preceded them and sends bertha velderkaust to the next world finally harry fairfield is shot in a fray with poachers and expires after making a confession that cooperates with other incidents to explain the wyvern mystery and to restore alice to her child who is forthwith proclaimed to society as the injured and longlost heir of wyvern,novel
i once and ayain  a nnovel new nnovels by though author of 4 cousin stella 3 vols smith elder  co 4 once and again is a nnovel which displays much thought and power of delineating shades of character the interest is of a painful kind but it is a pain that tends to profit and few readers will rio from the hook without feeling that they have gained som advantage from it the story turns upon thu mistakes aud mutual misunderstandings caused by the clashing qualities of people who wish to do right but who have not the clue to each others nature aud cannot understand the intention of their words or actions the heroine is a charming little girl who grows up to be a still more charming woman but all her fine and generous qualities ore made into weapons which aro turned by others against her own happiness this is a tragedy which often occurs iu real life when individuals who aro richly endowed with gifts of heart and iutellect are not able to hold these gifts in their duo proportion and cannot use them to advantage it may be that they seem to need a virtue less rather than a virtue more but in reality it i3 though faculty of discrimination that is neededtho power to discern the greater from the less so as to know in what proportion generosity ought to mingle with justicewhen selfsacrifice is heroic and when it is simply a reckless impulse of selfindulgence in the emotion of the present moment where this faculty compendiously called common sense is wanting the more precious the qualities with which the individual is endowed the more mischief they seem to do him but also if the individual to his own self be true neither the mischief nor the suffering is fatal ultimately the mistakes tend to the higher development of character the worst of it is that this life is often too short for the uses of experience and individuals who have once made shipwreck are not always strong enough for another venture and bo in the eyes of the unwise  they seem to fail altogether but mere success is not the measure of all that is good and to be desired thia is the idea which underlies the story of  once and again and it is made extremely interesting the heroine and her mother mrs temple live in an apartment in paris below them resides an elderly marquis a charming person with the best french characteristics for he is a thorough frenchman above them reside the family of a professor who are in very poor circumstances caused by though bail temper and worse conduct of though professor mgastineau himself these three households are the groundwork in which the conflicting interests of the story grow up and develope little laura is the personage in whom they centre though marquis is mrs temples sincere friend  but he is not in love with her and has no wish to marry her he has a sisterinlaw a madame de tillemont who has a son these two relatives wish very much to inherit the estate and riches of the marquis when he dies and to enjoy the advantages of them whilst he lives so that there is an antagonism and jealousy on their part against mrs temple mrs temple is a disappointed woman the cards have gone against her through life a portionless beauty of good scotch family she married a man of no connexions or position for the sake of his money and had been looked down upon by all her relations in consequence afterwards she married a spendthrift of good family and great expectations who had taken her for though sake of her jointure and who died before he came into the family estate leaving her with a diminished income and a very lnovely little girl the professor gastineau has managed to find favour in her sight though she treats him and his family in a contemptuous patronising manner the mother is a timid gentle drudge the children are in terror of their father one girl a cripple  the son a dark ungainly rough lad to them the little laura is an angel of lighj when sho runs upstairs to try to console them the bon of the professor is her playfellow and he worships her in a rude cymonlike fashion mrs temple is devoted to her child whom she loves and looks to as the means of achieving the social rank and fortune which have hitherto eluded her grasp into this condition of things a new element is imported  professor gastineau introduces a certain vicomte granson to mrs temple he is poor mean in his appearance vulgar in manner but he has lived in scotland and ho talks to mrs temple of things and people that she remembers and in the end she is bewitched by him falls in love for the first time in her dry and barron life promises to marry him and intrusts him with 5000j which is for lauras fortune to invest in some wonderful bhares which he recommends the child is the innocent means of unveiling the rascality of granson just in time to prevent though marriage  but mrs temple a woman of violent temper and narrow intellect never forgives her daughter for her share in the matter she revenges upon her child her own humiliation of course the money entrusted to the man is all lost and the poor woman begins a life of pinching poverty to try to prevent her daughter buffering from the loss of this money she becomes morose cold bitter and unkind to the child hiding whatever love she may feel miserable herself she makes the life of her daughter very hard to bear laura is misunderstood and mismanaged by her mother they go to live in the neighbourhood of a little german town where they reside in great seclusion though mother is engrossed in her economical difficulties and laura is left to take her chance au this is cleverly described indeed the whole book is written with great spirit and with a knowledge of foreign life and manners which gives an interest and an individuality to the story the eldest son of professor gastiueau whose father has come to an evil end leaving his family destitute has obtained a place as shopboy to a bookseller in the town near which laura and her mother have como to live  he is a clever ambitious boy determined to make his way full of energy courage and ability but though son of his father as regards his temper and disposition laura is enchanted to meet her old plnyfellow again he is to her merely the great boy who used to be good to her but she is to him an object of worship they meet each other often his bister a great romantic girl is a foolish companion for laura but there is no harm hardly any imprudence in this renewal of childish intimacy laura does not tell her mother that sho is teaching gastineau english because her mother will not accept confidence she is harsh and unjust and kills her childs love for her so far as so sweet a nature can be made unloving the natural complications ensue laura is taken into society of her own class she is admired there is a crownprince of a small state who would willingly lay his little crown at her feet lauras own english relations take her up and there is a cousinheir to the family estatewho loves her but laura has been worked upon through her generosity through her fear of giving pain through her fear of seeming proud to give young gastineau a rash promise to marry no one for three years this is very cleverly done and it is very true to female human nature she does not love gastineau she does not want to promise she knows it is not right but she is afraid to give him pain or to be unkind and she is also overawed by his vehemence so she not only gives him the promise but when she and her mother leave to return to paris she confirms it and hence most of the troubles that befall her when she has bound herself she soon finds out to her cost what it is to make a promise for gastineau has nothing of the gentleman in his naturehe uses his power meanly ultimately she obtains her freedom  but her mothers violent exaggerations drive her to desperation and she impetuously rushes into an engagement to marry the stupidemptyhearted nephew of the marquis who only proposes to her in the idea that through her favour with his uncle he shall come into his fortune she tries to do her duty and to make wrong right but her good qualities seem only to make her efforts more hopeless we cannot follow all the complications that ensue nor enter upon gaatineaus dastardly revenge though story throughout is very interesting the conclusion leaves her a widow free from all the mistakes of her early life which she has fairly worked out and learned the leeson they taught she is still young enough to have much hope before her and the author assures us she becomes a happy woman we recommend our readers to get the book for themselves as we have only indicated the mainsprings which move the story,novel
the fruitful vine by robert hichens fisher unwin this detailed study of a childless wife might be accounted an inquiry into the psychology of femininity in contradistinction to the psychology of the feminist were it not that we are inclined to view the principal character and her environment of looseliving italian society as abnormal some of the secondary characters are more naturally drawn notably the slightly eccentric but wholly delightful friend whose life has been broadened and deepened by loss of husband and children of the 570 pages which compose the book a large proportion are not relevant to the action and may in fact be said to retard it thereby diverting the interest too decidedly to what in themselves are sufficiently attractive descriptions of italian life and scenery mr hichens has so important a place of his own in literature that we regret anything which tends to confuse his writings with those of another author whose story of rome appealed to a very wide public in its dramatised form there is evidence that the authors usual care for the niceties of writing has become jaded during the progress of the work and some looseness in characterization is also evident we have known publishers who apparently valuing quantity more than quality have returned manuscripts to authors for the purpose of having them lengthened  here is a case where the publisher might well have suggested some excision  ithe fruitful vine by robert hichens t fisher unwin 6s if one knew little or nothing ofir robert hichens previous work one outstanding characteristic could be gathered from this present nnovelthat though he possesses an undoubted sense of the theatrical he has a very incomplete sense of drama  the fruitful vine  is a story of conjugal relationships amongst a handful of english people placed for a season or two m rome and roman society there is it is true a very ardent italian lover to justify the setting and a good deal of spectacular writing to explain why the author selected it mr hichens is an artist on the grand scale by this we mean that he paints on a large canvas so large that to miake any impression it must be stretched on rollers and nailed to wooden screens forming a background in front of which his small characters may speak their lines and so it comes about that the lights have to shine very brilliantly and the characters have to be touched up with a black pencil and a dab of rouge so that they may get over the footlights thus far mr hichens has a sense of the theatre but if he knew anything of the drama more particularly of its precious technique he would have better understood the dramatists art of compression  the fruitful vine  is a very long nnovel and occasionally it drags along so haltingly that we are inclined to thinks that mr hichens would have secured better results if he had not been so prodigal of labour for every new situation he has a new setting and he spends so much time shifting his scenery altering his lighting and finding lines for a host of superfluous  supers  that we are apt to lose sight of the essential story sir theodore canynge and his wife dolores canynge have a great sorrow in their lack of children the sorrow becomes by degrees a cause of difference between themnot a serious difference but still sufficient to destroy conjugal sympathy dolores canynge tries to make her husbands home more interesting by opening a salon to which she invites a mixed collection of savants and aristocrats in course of time sir theodore takes to calling on his fiend francis denzilon his wifes at home  days for denzil has a famiily of charming children and sir theodore is passionately devoted to children denzil develops canoer and dies leaving sir theodore canynge guardianto his children he takes up his trust thoroughly devoting all his time to it to the serious neglect of his wife who all the time is thinking if i could but have a child then my husband would come back to me left very much to herself she succumbs momentarily to the passionate wooing of a fine italian aristocrat caesare carelli later on a child is born and sir theodore whose darling wish is at last realised is transported with delight his wife however dies almost immediately and next day caesare carelli comes to claim his son this baldly is mr hichens plot extracted from a mass of detail which is really disseverable from it despite its prolixity of style the fruitful vine  makes a powerful and absorbing nnovel the character of dolores drawn with a light touch albeit with too bright colours is a charming and characteristic piece of work the description of rome and roman society though a little too overloaded with detail is skilful and entertaining the psychology of the book though not altogether inspired is often illuminating without being accounted as equal to the authors best work it is a nnovel which will create considerable interest,novel
hena or life in tahiti by mrs alfred hort 2 vols saunders otley  co had mrs alfred hort honestly endeavoured to describe the social aspects of tahiti she would have found readers whose curiosity about life in that lnoveliest of pacific islands would have disposed them to deal tenderly with her artistic and literary shortcomings and even to judge her still graver offences with leniency but as  hena or life in tahiti regarded from its most favourable point of view is merely one of those foolish nnovels that are annually published in obedience to the dictates of personal vanity rather than in compliance with any genuine public demand for worthless literature it is more than probable that the author will hear some hard truths about the least creditable features of her work the first chapter of the story introduces thcreader to the natives of papeete the principal district of tahiti and also to the distinctive graces of the author who describes though tahitian  pareu as being a piece of printed cotton  which is wound round the waist and replaces the necessity of pantaloons and who remarks of the wearers of this simple costume  when excited or inebriated they have a decidedly savage appearance their heads shoulders and bodies decked fantastically with green vines reminding one forcibly of groups of wild bacchanalians as represented in the paintings of the  roman period in recognition of their finer qualities mrs hort says  towards each other the natives are generous and lavish to a fault  share and share alike appears to be their motto and maxim which they act up to from puffs at a straw cigarette alternating between a group of men and women down to the pig in preparation for their meal that we may feel ourselves quite at home with the swarthy children of papeete we are informed in sufficiently clear though scarcely faultless language they have frequent recourse to ablutions the bath being a luxury common to all its delights unknown out of a tropical clime bathing takes place in the open river whilst preparing for the plunge and dressing occur under some friendly tree whose widespreading branches protect the bather from the toopowerful rays of the sun as well as the gaze of stray passers it is whilst they are thus taking a riverbath that hena the lnovely child of a tahitian girl by a french officer and her especial friend taai a native of pure blood are surprised by mr seymour an english visitor to the island and his friend de lorme a pleasureloving frenchman who has recently come out to the settlement to fill a government office and occupy  a cottage in a pretty little suburb called stemilie comprised of one long rural lane the sight of hena in the clear stream so completely upsets young de lormes prudent resolve to hold himself aloof from native women that maddened by what he saw through  that part of henas dress which must have been torn in the exertion of bathing disclosing some portion of her form he determines to make her charms his property at any cost short of marriage but before northeast has effected his purpose the discovery that hena is his halfsister causes a sudden relinquishment of an intention which would have resulted in failure or incest  to think seymour exclaims de lorme to his english friend  that she is my own little sister after all has my father not acted infamously in thus abandoning such a child i could almost curse himforthe barbarous actin response to which filial sentiment from a disappointed seducer and in concession to circumstances which we are thankful to say there is no occasion for us to recapitulate mr seymourthe type of english culture manliness morality and material prosperityundertakes to provide for the wretched little hena by making her his wife all this is absurd and unpleasant enough but that which follows is even more ridiculous and nauseous unable to achieve a complete victory over his abortive passion for hena de lorine determines to search for a mistress whose shape and colour and grace may remind him of his sisters charms if he cannot clutch the desire of his heart he will at least have a fruit of the same fragrance and flavour as the forbidden after vainly hunting for a girl with a stronger resemblance to hena he at length takes as a temporary wife a tahitian girl whose eyes remind him of his sisters not only does he thus make his arrangements for private enjoyment but he actually tells his brotherinlaw what considerations guided him in the selection of a new mistress  you he exclaims to arthur seymour have obtained a wife without the slightest manoeuvring for whom i would have risked my reputation my future to call mine i have hunted everywhere for such another hena in vain  the young girl now under my protection i took because i fancied her large black eyes resembled hers in what manner does mr seymour respond to his friends his brotherinlaws communication  does he knock him down out of hand or kick him or throw him out of a

renouncing him for ever nothe interview between the brothersinlaw is continued in the friendliest spirit and before its termination seymour renews his offers of assistance to de lorine on getting through this interview which occurs at the beginning of the second volume our countrymans dishonour affected us so acutely that we lost no time in dropping his acquaintance and the book that had

1 kissing the rod a nnovel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth nnovel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the nnovel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lnovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends who were neither slow nor cold in recognising the merits of his earlier stories and who sincerely regret the imperfections of his present book he clearly stands in need of repose and we urge him to rest now so that heand

  literatube the city of sunshine the citij of sunshine by alexander allardyce w blackwood and sons as a rule there is no more unromantic mortal living than the angloindian the  gryphon  and enthusiastic specials who skim the surface of the land in a cool season are indeed prone to break into glowing periods concerning the gorgeous east but the effect produced upon the european character by any prolonged residence in the most picturesque and at the same time the most humourous country in the world would appear to be almost invariably commonplaceness and unalterable gravity the reason is not of course difficult to discover there are awkward practical qualities underlying indian picturesqueness and indian absurdity which tend to detract from their charm with though national prepossession in favour of the more solid virtues it is difficult for the average englishman to retain any delight in the flowery jungle or the fairylike grotesqueness of though native bazaar when he has learned that the one means lurking snakes and poisonous miasmas and the other any number of grave offences against salubrity in the same way he ceases to be attracted by patriarchal habits and romantic beliefs when he finds that these by no means indicate the manly qualities of energy and uprightness but after all it is a part of the englishmans philistinism his meiitorious philistinism no doubt but philistinism notwithstanding to dislike or despise the romance of india because of her deficient respectability this deficiency is not to be denied  as far as thc respectable virtues go india has some cause to feel ashamed but her shortcomings here are after all but negatiae qualities thc result of applying to her a foreign standard the positive quality the distinguishing fact about herself and her people is not respectability nor the lack of respectability but romance she is only to be seen truthfully and interpreted justly when looked at from the romantic viewpoint so that it is really to le regretted that just those people who know most about ber refuse either to see or to paint her for us under this her most lovable and vital aspect mr allardyce ave hasten to say forms a brilliant exception to though rule evidently he is under no illusions himself as to the character of the mild hindoo ho does not attempt to attribute to him any of the heroic virtues nor does he represent india after though manner of the gushing special as a paradise of luxuriant splendour he is content to paint her as he finds her as imagination and experience have shoavn her to himwith all her faults and aveakness her unreliability caprices and deceits but at the same time with all her dreamy fascination  her grace her pathetic tenderness above all her poetry which hides a multitude of sins the  city of sunshine as its description stands in our nnovel will do for the picture of almost any bengal village of tolerable size there is the picturesque little temple under the fluttering peepnltree though dilapidated but imposinglooking mansion of the poor native nobleman of the place  the tawdry stucco dwelling of the rich mabajan or moneylender  and then the street of quaint little open shops either linc broken here and there by high brick avails oaershadowed by largeleaved plantains mr allardyce is sufficient artist to people his little world with none save living and typical men and av omen ave have no layfigures no ghosts to fill up empty niches and corners all bis characters from ram la ll the greedy oilman to gangooly the simple garrulous headman of thc village  from kristo lahory the proud and poor brabmau to three shells the moneylender and arillain of the story are true not only to life bnt to natiate life the reader may learn as much from studying even this little side group of secondary personages as from spending many hours in the actual dust and heat and bustle of an indian bazaar but there are two studies of a much higher dramatic order testifying not only to the authors exceptional grasp of the shades and colour of character but also of his clear sense of the very questionable improvement for moral worth or personal happiness to bo effected by encouraging young india to make one mouthful of all european intellectualism much after the manner that the ancestral sage vasistha swalloaaed the thunderbolt of brahma  with much the samo results alsoof sore inward burnings and outward vomitings of smoke inasmuch as the noble human spirit or thc spirit which just falls short of being noble is always a higher matter of study than the oddities and drolleries of vulgar natures krishna gossain the faithless apostle of the brahma somaj is a more interesting creation than romesh chunder roy otherwise mr r c roy of the calcutta bar the anglicised baboo who has tasted the delights of one years spoiling and petting in london but mr r c roy is deliciously lifelike with his  enlightenment his quotations from shakespeare his poems patent leather boots contempt for his countrymens prejudices and withal his imperturbable goodhumour krishna is as ave have said of a noble type  he is the son ofthe kindly and cultured old priest of dhupnagar and has been sent by his father to calcutta to learn not though heresies but the wisdom of thc sahibs here he associates himself with the neav sect of thc brahma somaj and avc have him in the first scene tearing off and discarding his brahminical cord as a solemn preparation for the life of persecution and hardship he is eager to court as a national reformer in truth his zeal is real and earnest he is quite ready to meet martyrdom in attempting to reclaim bis countrymen from their idolatrous superstitions but avorse dangers than persecution beset bis faith instead of disinheriting or heaping reproaches on his son the kindly old priest receives him with tender pity and sets about contriving a marriage for him with a hindoo girl for avhom he has conceived a pas sion little by little krishnas new religious fervour melts away under the influence of his love and his fathers generous kindness though romantic attractions of the old religion begin to exercise a dreamy charm over him  and in the very midst of all these influences the calcutta theistical society commit though error of sending down to dhupnagar mr lt c roy so as to confirm and strengthen his flickering faith krishna has all though poetic sensitiaeness and refinement of the higbcasto oriental and the shallow vulgarity and hybrid anglicism of his lowborn countryman finish the work of bia demoralisation and the smoking flax is quenched though scene in which mr r c roy arrives at dhupnagar is so humorous that wo cannot forbear from quoting it forth from the palanquin crawled a man of middle stature with skin mackel than the blackest native of dhupnagar but dressed foppishly after though manner ofthe angloindian dandies of calcutta an enormous sola or pithhat covered with yellow silk and resembling in shape a huge overgrown toadstool was perched jauntily upon his crisp locks  his dress was a loose jacket of black paramatta with a vest of though same material sufficiently low in though breast to show a dirty shirtfront garnished with gold studs and a pair of stifflystarched white trousers which had apparently been just put on to enhance the solemnity of the wearers entrance into dhupnagar his feet wero encased in natty little boots of shining patent leather and he wore a necktie of though most gorgeous colours kings pins watchchains and charms with precious stones dug from though mines of bristol that golconda of the west adorned his elegant person in great profusion in one hand he poised a goldheaded cane while in though other he flourished a scented handkerchief of less than doubtful whiteness   thus far into though bowels of the land as the divine shakespeare saith soliloquised the stranger addressing himself in the english tongue as ho stood up and looked about him  but littlo

phenomenon this might bc wearing the dress of a foreigner yet having the features and tongue of the bengalee are you though headman of this village demanded the hybrid shaking out the perfume from his pockethandkerchief as gangooly thoughtlessly approached too closely to his delicate nostrils though headman again salaamed and answered in the affirmative adding moreover though information that his fathers had been headmen of dhupnagar since though british had obtained the stewardship of bengal behar and orissa and have you no hotels in this benighted and heavenforsaken hamlet my good friend said the stranger whom we may without further reserve introduco to though roader as mr it c roy  is there any decent place where a gentleman can get a nights lodging   i dont know baboothat is sahib i mean said gangooly scratching his head  your honour sees that when respectable hindus come to dhupnagar we are like to fight among ourselves for the pleasure of entertaining them for verily as holy writ sayeth  that man is truly excellent who offers to a guest a soft seat clean water and sweet words and when a poor man comes among us we all giao him something to make up a meal and quarter him with some one of his own condition  for as the scriptures again say  benevolence towards all living creaturesthis is religion but in the case ofthat is to sayin fact your honour stammered the headman twirling his ckaddar in perplexity strangers never do como here and so wo dont very well know what we would do with them and is your honour a hindoo demanded gangooly dubiously as ho eyed though

continued striking a light for himself on the sido of a fuseebox  but aro you a man of caste sahib   asked gangooly fidgeting about uneasily at though idea of being impertinent to ono who might bc a rajah or a deputymagistrate or somo other great official of government but at the same time fearing lest he should compromise the caste of himself or his neighbours by giving hospitality to a pariah

dispersod with tha exception of gangooly the headman who still stood uneasily before the stranger scratching his likid and twisting though corner of his upper garment in mute per pexify as to what he should do with this awkward arrival we must of course let mr allardyce himself unfold the intricacy and detail of krishnas descent from the high moral position of a national reformer to the easy tolerance of a cultured hindoo whoso favourite maxim is that  there is no creed so bad but it may serve to comfort some poor soul but the reader may take our word for it that though krishnas course may be considered by some a doavnward one he never fails to carry with him our sympathy and interest another excellent lifepicture is mr eversley the collector an angloindian of the oldfashioned type

common one is that it refuses to take a lively interest in india but this accusation is no longer well founded  there is a growing desire to know and understand india better and a few more such

lost for love lost fr lore by the author of  lady audleys secret c in three volumes chlatto anti windus the story told of the negro who was unable to count his masters pigs accurately because one of

miss braddon had nothing to do the critics raved but aurora floyd was in demand at the shops we are not in a position to state how many stories of our authoress were cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady nnovelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in nnovelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a nnovel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet nnovel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to express by the phrase quiet nnovel a work such as the vicar of wakeifiold oriiiri ciniawinnsthe trollope series of fictionsreaders of contemporary romances will have met with dozeus of quiet nnovels with dialogue as enlightened as the cackle of goese upon the green and a plot about as elaborate as the play of 1 puinch  when the manager is doubtful of timo feel to lbe tirrnaed himt for his trouble a more pretentious class of writers use

find it a more or n unprofitable calling to glean in the districts off which mi bradlon has reaped a crop it would occur to us id reading the nnovel now before us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as nnovels go a good nnovel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a nnovel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination nnovels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the composition of her later

evanll iarrlngton0 rwyently original in conception rich in stirring incident and artistic delineation of character exhibiting with photographic fidelity and delicacy of detail a deep knowledge of

such a favourable reception in its serial forma most trying ordeal by the way for a nnovel whose succes must mainly depend on its unity of design and the sustain t action of its iranatis peronazwill be cordially welcomed by all lovers of the higher class of fiction for our own parts we scarcely remember perusing a mare fascinating work m3r mteredith has evidently taken in a kindly spirit the numerous comments evoked by certain artistic imperfections that detracted in some degree from the merits of his  ordeal of richard feverel and this his second essay in this department of literature bears abundant proof that the suggestions of his critics have not been thrown away upon him e evan harrington posnewes one peculiar point of excellence which lifts it per salum aove the as of modern works of fiction its interest does not depend as is the case with the majority of even the better class of nnovels on the especial elaboration of any one element be it incident character portraiture description or dialogue or whatever other speciality the writer may look upon as his peculiarjrte but each and all of these essentials are rigidly kept in view throughout without even the appearance of effortthe tout eysemble forming a powerful and iid picture of real life the plot of the story is eminently original and in these days when ey subject bas been worn threadbare and adaptation is the only refuge for  usedup nnovelista and playwrights originality of plot should count for something it would be for to our purpose  well as incompatible with the limit of the present notice to give even

as a woman we are either angels or good fellows or heaven knows what that is bad no exquisite delicacy no insinuating softness mixed with respect none of that hovering over the border as papa used to say none of that happy indefiniteness of manner which seems to declare i would love you if i might or  i do but i dare not tell even when engaged in the most trivial attentionshanding a footstool

but that for ungrateful evans sake i sacrificed my peace by binding myself to a dreadful sort of halfstory i know i did not quite say it it seems as if sir as ghost were going to haunt me and then i have the most dreadful fears that what i have done has disturbed him in the other world can it be so it is not money or estates we took at all dearest  and these excellent young curatesi almost wish

every day leaner of course and does not habitually straddle whiskers and morals i mean we must be silent before our prudish sister not a prude we talk diplomacy dearest he complains of the exclusiveness of the port of oporto and would have strict alliance between portugal and england with mutual privileges i wish the alliance and think it better to maintain the exclusiveness very trifling but what is life  and now for the hero and heroine the character of evan harrington is most artistically pourtrayed the very opposite of his intriguing sister frank and openhearted to a fault keenly sensitive to his sale position and yet halfreconciled to it by his absorbing love for rose ready to sacrifice his best and brightest hopes to save his sisters reputation fighting the hard fight between love and duty selfrelying and at last selfconquering the tory of his trials cannot fail to excite the deepest interest and sympathy in the reader and what of roserose the proud and defiant beauty yet gentle and loving withal full of unwavering confidence in the love of the man whom she loves regardless of his plebeian origin and the worlds verdict for all this however we fear rose will

a married beneath him a nnovel 3 vols mac nullan  co the author of lost sir massingberd supplies another lamentable illustration to the ancient proverb that it is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity in his former and so far as wo know only other effort he gave good proof of his capacity to weave an interesting btory and to tell it naturally and well the worthless production before us contains literally nothing with any pretence to interest which is not unnatural and nothing true to nature which is worth the trouble of reading whether it be that fate has given its author just that amount of power with his pen which a wasp has with its stingto use it once at whatever time his pleasure dictates and so expend its usefulness for ever or whether it be that success has made him too sanguine and too hasty in endeavouring to follow it up we are not anxious to decide in either case we forewarn him from the fate of these three whited sepulchres he will have to learn a painful lesson he is manifestly not qualified for the present prevailing fashion of writing os rapidly as he can read we should hesitate in speaking of this heterogeneous concourse of twaddle pomposity and clumsy english with half the harshness we feel towards it had not its perpetrator gone out of his way to put himself beyond the pale of that tenderness which is due to a young author in lost sir massingberd he began with diffidence and ended with apologies both of which were unnecessary here all at once he throws off his mask of modesty and devotes an entire patronising chapter to an arrogant contrast of himself as an old stager with literary tyros what may have happened within six months interval to effect so great a change in his position beyond the moderate and deserved success of a good tale well told we will not be impertinent enough to inquire however it may be the writer who ventures on such a step should take care to select a good occasion for it and not thrust forward as his gauntlet a nnovel with its only attraction in the title and its only charm in the termination all the intermediate part of married beneath him might advantageously be put into half a column of the serial which brought it to lightone of the few serials it may congratulate itself which could afford so generous a deed without doing grave damage to its own fair fame two very precocious boys  playmates  surnamed galton and meyrick whose careers begin at the age of seventeen and end before they are twenty are the heroes of the story they commence life together at  st minims college camforda university intended possibly to prefigure the one recently proposed for wales but which assuredly has not the faintest resemblance either to oxford or cambridge here galton takes to literature and speedily becomes immortalit is hard to say how or whyby association with a paper called the porcupine which bythehy appears in the first volume as a modest weekly journal and in the third as the daily organ of the government this is the one who is  married beneath him to a servantgirl the othermeyrickis remarkable only for drinking and for marrying an ordinary mortal and indeed only appears to have been created for the purpose of being murdered by his friend who gets through the ordeal of an absurdly  described trial by means of an impossible defence on the ground of insanity and then retires to switzerland where with intense relief the reader is allowed to leave him perfectly satisfied with his choice of a wife in these few lines we have faithfully abstracted the whole of the authors plot for his sake no less than for our own we refrain from dwelling on the other materials of which these 800 pages are composed their blemishes will be equally disgusting to universitymen to lawyers to ordinary nnovelreaders to collectors of accredited witticisms and to lovers of common decency the only moral of the story if any is sought to redeem it from utter aimlessness must be that a gentlemans son may marry a servant behave like a knave as well as like a fool run into debt commit a murder hire a barrister to prove glaring lies and be profoundly happy and universally admired after all we have baid this is the only moral let us add that the author has supplied a second  there are few things more touching than the attempts of a youth to make his ideas known to his fellowcreatures

i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen  co mr maxwells latest nnovel is virtually an elaborate and conscientious portrait of a temperament all the interest centres in one dominant personality the figure of a strong man with a titanic capacity and a passion for work john barnards ambition is an almost superhuman obsession he loves his work for its own sake as well as for the rewards it is to bring him he rejoices alike in his own power and in the contest but in the struggle for success his domestic happiness suffers shipwreck eventually his health breaks down in such a manner that the world of action is completely closed to him while the life of thought and introspection opens the latter portion of the book is an interesting study in morbid pathology skilfully and even impressively done the main flaw in this cleverly told story is the psychological development of lady edith the wife which just misses being convincing through imperfect realization we cannot believe in her departure from the path of virtue  i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen and co 6s every nnovelist is a psychologist nowadays the clash of mind with mind or the influence of mind upon mind forms the basis of ninetenths of our modern highly strung love stories not many writers however are as successful as is mr maxwell in delineating his characters in this latest nnovel from his pen we have perhaps as cleverly contrived a situation as he has ever given usthe antagonism between a man whose ideal is work work directed to one end and a woman whose ideal is love barnard who is rapidly rising in the financial world and means to rise to the top marries lady edith rathkeale in a severe attack of lovesickness she consenting sees in his tenderness the promise of a lifetimes happy comradeship he is never rough with her nor is he ever unkind or thoughtless but he simply does not understand her and is content in a placid unemotional way with the comforts of home which he samples between the rushes of business his wife gradually breaks down but by far the more serious collapse comes to barnard himself and a third of the book is taken up by the story of this failure of nerve and the effort to cure that strong overstrained brain we must say that here the interest flags considerably in spite of the long and wellwritten conversations the end is in view all the time and the reader grows restless on the whole however the situation is splendidly handled and the gradual drifting apart of husband and wife is portrayed very finely to make both of them seek consolation elsewhere was we think inartistic and a concession to the methods of the feujileton which the author should have resisted the redhaired typist and secretary with whom barnard has an  affair  is far too melodramatic to be convincing and the scene between her and lady edith carries little conviction barnard is capital with his colossal conceit of himself leave j b to his unfettered discretion  i john barnard he reminds us of the great joe bagstock the ending is sad but true to life and in the general scheme of his story mr maxwell proves himself a psychologist of no mean order   the wifes evidence by w g wills 3 vols j hurst  blackett i in the wifes evidence there are the materials for an excellent nnovel of strong interest j if the author would only have told his tale quietly and steadily the subject is unhackneyed and there are skill and originality in  building up the incidents and drawing the i characters but the author loses time and space by indulging in declamatory bits of elo quence and in the desire to be dramatic he  has weakened the effect of a story sufficiently remarkable to need no adventitious aid of rhetoric the outline of the tale is briefly as follows a son long estranged from home by a quarrel with his father has married made his own way in the world and been for some time successful as a literary man and editor of a journal he is however at the opening of the story on the verge of bankruptcy the first scenes are merely introductory to show the character of the man and the nature of the charming good wisehearted wife whom he is so fortunate as to possess screening her brother who having been his confidential clerk had embezzled a large sum of money has been the real cause of colemans embarrassments and nearly of his disgrace coleman will not disclose the secret of a man whom he has pardoned and who is repenting his crime but his wife proves the facts and his good name is cleared the wilful character of the man in adhering to a course of action he has once adopted is well illustrated in these preliminary scenes but they are too long and too minutely drawn out they detain the reader from the main interest of the tale after the affairs of the bankruptcy are wound up coleman his wife and child go into somersetshire to stay with his mother now a widow and sole mistress of the paternal acres her character is well and clearly drawn full of good sense and geniality she has also a vein of fierce untractable matteroffact implacability lying beneath the surface mother and son resemble each other in their dogged tenacity of purpose she and her son have never been estranged all these years they have been in regular correspondence and on his fathers death she would have had him home only that he was then following his own career in london she receives him and his wife with a hearty welcome whilst little johnny their son is the delight of her heart the return to the old home and the description of the life there led are well done the character of coleman is well developed with his quaint genial humour his tenderness for his wife and the gnarled perverse knot of obstinacy in his nature with which only his wife can deal domesticated in the family they find the farm bailiff a rude florid coarse goodlooking man who had become manager of the farm on the death of the husband when coleman could not or would not return to take his own place as head of the family in the years that have elapsed the bailiff has secured his influence and coleman discovers that his mother is on the brink of marrying him fondly hoping that they may still continue to live together as a happy family all this story is well and skilfully told the scene between mother and son is extremely good and the character of the old woman is very true to human nature when her son reproaches her with disrespect to his fathers memory lowe your father nothingshe said your father did me a mean turn which i have not forgotten and shant forget to my dying day your aunt dora could tell you all about it its no matter no matter but you have minded me of a good reason for what i mean to do for gods sake what has my father done mother which could influence you to sacrifice yourself i always believed that you and my father lived happily eh dear happily that is the happiness i never talk of injustice or wrongs but i dont think of em the less not much happened since then in this quiet house to put em out of my mind then to the quiet astonishment of her son who scarcely trusted his ears she gave him the history with feminine bitterness and detail of a certain velvet mantle which her husband had long promised her and made a deal of fuss about when it arrived she could have put a piedish under cither shoulder it was such an illfit and she wished to have it sent back and altered what do you think he did will he tumbled the mantle into its box and sent it off as a present to your aunt dora the woman of all the world i hate the most and he told me to my face a few days after that he had heard from her to say it was a good fit for her i have done him many a kind turn since that will and i sat up for six nights with him when he wab dying without ever taking off my clothes but i tellee i was thinking of that drees when i looked from my window and saw the velvet on his hearse with all this implacability there is a simple straightforwardness in the old lady which wins the readers sympathy shemarries the bailiff with a guileless trust that is almost heroic of course though natural result followshe has married her for her money and proves a coarse tyrant her son and his wife stay beside her to shield and comfort her and to be ready to take her away when she is willing to go but the catastrophe comes quickly personally illused her husband drawing all her hardlysaved money and squandering it in riotous living bringing his mistress into the house the wretched old woman is maddened with indignation one night coming home drunk after a lengthened absence he insults her beyond her power to endure he reels upstairs to bed and she fetches a hatchet and murders him in his sleep her son hearing a noise goes to her room and finds her standing with the hatchet in her hand the necessity for action the instinct to saare his mother at whatever cost prompt him to take measures which have the effect of involving him in a aveb of suspicious and incriminating circumstances his avife who alone could have given the information which avould have cleared him is kept by him out of the way at the coroners inquest the result is that he is committed for trial along with the old lady as guilty of the murder he then deliberately resolves to sacrifice himself his wife and child and to save his mother a wife cannot give evidence in a criminal case either for or against her husband eleanors despair her efforts her baffled endeavours to make the truth heard are well described but in the last volume the style is throughout declamatory and rhetorical which aveakens the effect the quietest and most steady avriting was needed to make the working out of colemans fanaticism probable or pleasant he prefers his mother to his avise and child and having decided to save her it needed great delicacy and good management on the part of the author to carry the sympathy of the reader with him but he wastes all his strength to illustrate the hardship of the law that prevents a wife bearing testimony for her husband and to this purpose the symmetry and strength of the nnovel is sacrificed coleman trifles with his avife deceives her keeps her at arms length and behaves to her in a manner entirely unworthy of her faithfulness and courage the whole of the last volume is hurried there is a want of good workmanship which is the more provoking as the author has shown himself quite capable of the mechanism of his craft all that passes after the trial is weak and confused a condemned murderer is not allowed to leave his cell and go out into the avorld on a mere  reprieve the statement of the old lady given under the influence of an overdose of laudanum would have required corroboration and her confession is so hazy that it reads more like the murmuring of delirium than a definite statement the scene between eleanor and her husband in prison when she brings him the good news is feeble and unsatisfactory the author appears to have become weary of his task or else to have considered it unnecessary to finish up his work in a businesslike manner he gives all his care and attention to the sensation scenes instead of considering his work as a whole the character of michael the irish retainer is clever and his mode of dealing with the witnesses is amusingly characteristic but there is too much of him and he is too stagey to touch the sympathy of the reader the author of the wifes evidence is capable of writing a powerful wellsustained nnovel and we hope he will give us one that will do justice to his talent,novel
guy deverell new nnovels by j s le fanu 3 vola i bentley  guy deverell is a tale which is well told and light in hand it is easy to read and will draw the reader on to the end it is not a sensation nnovel and those who have read  uncle silas will be surprised and perhaps a trifle disappointed to find the broad natural daylight iu which the whole story stands revealed there is certainly a green chamber which plays an important part in the catastrophe but it is not a haunted room and the book may be read in the loneliest nook at any hour of the night without shock to the nerves of a timid reader there are two highlywrought and very powerful scenes in  guy deverell which prove that mr le fanu can do something better than evoke eerie terrors whilst he can write an episode like that of the discovery of lady jane lennox by her husband he has no need to seek to excite sensations by murders and mysteries in ruinous manorhouses the story of lady jane lennox has but slight and accidental connexion with the main thread of the nnovel it is made the means of bringing about retribution on a worthless man but it is quite a forced conclusion for m verbarriere who represents the eumenides in his own person has no need to betray lady jane or to denounce her to her husband it does not assist his own designs nor further any ends of justice the elderly lover for whom the beautiful lady jane betrays her excellent husband is the hero of the nnovel sir jekyl marlowe is a bad worthless man of the jolly dog type of humanity which was fashionable when the first gentleman of europe was regent he inspires no sentiment in the reader he is said to be elegant in manner and handsome in person but as for his elegance he is perpetually chuckling he chuckles and leers at buxom landladies taps them on the cheek calls them  pretty little devils  rogues  and  wicked little conjurors also he has attacks of gout and in a nnovel gout is quite fatal to any tender interest sir jekyl is also a man without heart or any sense of honour he has had some very ugly antecedents in years gone by he first ruined a young man hy gambling and then shot him down unfairly in a duel besides all this he has inherited the young mans fortune which fell to him in conse quence of the iniquitous conduct of his own father the bad sir harry marlowe who had gtolen a certain important deed the possession of the illgotten wealth troubled the wicked old gentleman on his deathbed and he had made his son the present sir jekyl swear solemnly to make restitution of the deed telling him where it was to be found also he had solemnly enjoined him to pull down the wing of the house containing the green chamber which wing had been added by sir harry himself sir jekyl fulfilled neither of his fathers injunctions and the nnovel shows how he came to grief in consequence twenty years after he had come into possession of the estate being then a widower with an only child a daughter as fair as jephthas he is startled very unpleasantly by the sudden appearance of a young man the exact counterpart of his early friend whom he had ruined and murdered and whose inheritance he is unjustly enjoying guy deverell was the name of his victim guy strangways is the name of the young man who is his counterpart but as guy deverell was certainly dead and as assuredly buried he cannot be the same person and sir jekyl tries to believe the resemblance is only a disagreeable coincidence with guy strangways there is a stout saturnine elderly frenchman m verbarrifere whom he calls uncle sir jekyl is impelled to cultivate the acquaintance of the strangers who are travelling for pleasure to see the things worthy of note in the neighbourhood he invites them to his house and they come m verbarriere to pick up information and to spy out secrets especially to ascertain the mystery of the  green chamber the young man comes to fall in love with beatrix tne daughter of his host the reader is soon made aware that the two strangers have designs upon sir jekyls peace m verbarriere is in reality the friend who stood by poor guy deverell when he was shot down in the duel and though at the time unable to make the affair known being himself under proclamation of outlawry he still held fast to though purpose of avenging his friend having amassed a fortune in india he had returned to england to execute justice on sir jekyl bringing with him his nephew the son of poor guy deverell by a secret marriage with m verbarrires sister more than this we shall not say for the secret of a nnovel is a possession of the author and his reader  new nnovels guy deverell by f sheridan le fanu three vols r bentley m 1r le fanus name is not to be found in messrs routledges new edition of men of the time a dictionary of eminent living characters of both sexes which consists of 860 pages closely printed in double columns not that such an omission matters much where the name is really that of an eminent person for the compiler appears never to have heard of rdnan taine or herbert spencer and such books are chiefly valuable as furnishing the names of those who hang on great mens skirts of whom no other record exists the object in searching there for that of mr le fanu was to ascertain at what period the author of  uncle silas  made his first appearance as a nnovelist we believe that mr le fanu was first introduced to the public in the pages of the dublin university magazine in which appeared in monthly instalments  the house by the churchyard afterwards published in 1863 by messrs tinsley brothers in three volumes though by no means a high class nnovel that tale of irish life gave promise of something better for the future  for nothing can be more natural and lifelike than chapelizod its garrison and inhabitants the very language too if not equal to carletons had the true ring and smack about it but as the tale progresses the interest ceases and all ends in confusion mr le fanus second nnovel was wylders hand  which was followed at the close of last year by uncle silas both of which were noticed at considerable length in our second january number of the present year what was there stated can only be repeated now mr le fanu is an eminently disappointing author in  the house by the churchyard he came out well in what we may call scenery and decorations  in  wylders hand he proved that he could invent and tell a good story in uncle silas he sketched one figure at least with great power for in the character of millicent he shows that he does not want for sympathy with pleasant and innocent human nature whilst in his present tale by overindulging his appetite for the monstrous and horrible he tyres his reader and destroys the interest of the story even before the perusal of the first volume has been accomplished  guy deverell has been served up in monthly slices to the readers of the dtublin university magazine as a separate slice each had to be seasoned to suit the palate of the reader as a whole too much of the monstrous and horrible has spoiled the dish sir jekyl marlowe i a man of many thousand acres and member for the county accidentally meets with two strange gentlemen at a roadside inn the younger one so strongly reminds him of a dead relative that he hurries after them to a ruined abbey near by which they had gone to seeill see this fellow face to face and talk a bit with him i dare say if one were near hes not at all so like it i8 devilish odd though twentyfive years and not a relation on earthand dead hang him egad4 its like the wandering jew and the what do you call em vitm having after some difficulty accomplished his purpose entered into conversation presented his card or  snowy parallelogram and given the young man an invitation to marlowe he asks boldly for his name in return my name is guy strangways said the stranger  0ho  its very odd exclaimed the baronet in a sharp snarl quite unlike his previous talk i think the distance between them was a little increased and he was looking askance upon the young gentleman who made him a very low foreign bow there was a silence and just then a deep metallic voice from below called guyhollo   excuse mejust a moment and the young man was gone the baronet waited hell be back muttered sir jekyl in a minute but the baronet was mistaken he waited at that open window whistling out upon the deepening twilight till the edges of the ivy began to glitter in the moonbeams and the bats to trace their zigzags in the air and at last he gave over ewecting xi elooked back into the gloomy void of that great chamber and listened and felt rather angry at his queer sensations he had not turned about when the stranger withdrew and did not know the process of his vanishing and for the first time it struck him who the plague could the fellow who called him be  an impression is thus at once created in the mind of sir jekyl of the supernatural the next appearance of guy strangways and his friend is at wardlock church where lady alice redeliffe the mother of beatrix the beautiful daughter of wicked sir jekyl are in the  reddliffe seat in the centre of the gallery as lady alice looked with her cold and steady glance over the congregation in the aisle during the interval of silence that precedes the commencement of the service a tall and graceful young man with an air of semiforeign fashion entered the church accompanied by an elderly gentleman of whom she took comparatively little note the young man and his friend were ushered into a seat confronting the gallery lady alice gazed and gazed transfixed with astonishment and horror the enamelled miniature on her bosom was like but there in that clear melancholy face with its large eyes and wavy hair was a resurrection in that animated sculpture were delicate tracings and touches of natures chisel which the artist had failed to represent which even memory had neglected to fix but which all now returned with the startling sense of identity in a moment she had put on her gold spectacles as she always did on taking her seat and opened her  morning service  bound in purple russia with its golden clasp and long ribbons fringed with the same precious metal with the intent to mark the proper psalms and lessons at her haughty leisure she therefore saw the moving image of her dead son before her with an agonising distinctness that told like a blight of palsy on her face she saw his elderly companion also distinctly a roundshouldered man with his short caped cloak still on a grave man with a large high bald forehead a heavy hooked nose and great hanging moustache and beard a dead and ominous face enough except for the pierceing glance of his full eyes under very thick brows and just the one you would have chosen out of a thousand portraits for a plotting highpriest or an old magician this magician is bent upon punishing sir jekvl for some wrong deed in former years and revealing the mysteries of a dreadful  green chamber which is said to be haunted by a devil we have not space to give an outline of the tale but must refer the reader to the book itself for a satisfactory elucidation of the anguish of poor lady alice at the apparent resuscitation of her dead son guy deverell those who have an appetite for horrors will no doubt enjoy the book but literature has claims upon mr le fanu which he should not ignore let him write a nnovel which shall not first appear piecemeal in a magazine he has all the qualifications of a good nnovelist and cannot fail then to produce a nnovel worthy

mademoiselle mathilde new nnovels by henry kingsley i 3 vols bradbury  evans tins last production of mr kingsley will disappoint his readers not that there is any j absence of vigour or point in the writing  or any change in those peculiarities of style  which have gained him admirers on the contrary mademoiselle mathilde exhibits that delicacy of feeling that power of expression which distinguish the author from the ordinary nnovelist and which will always prevent his works from becoming tame or commonplace it is not then in the style of the writing that this book will fail nor in the way the history of the heroines life is worked out but in the very essence of a successful nnovel  in the story itself we must premise that in using the word fail as applied here we do not intend it to convey the idea of an utter failure but rather that mr kingsley will not create such an impression as he has done by preceding compositions the cause of this want of success arises from the story itself and this might be expected when the circumstances under which it was written are well considered mr kingsley says in his preface  the choice of a story was extremely difficult till in consultation one said tell them the story we heard at st malo and of which we have so often spoken since the thing was done from this we can easily deduce that mr kingsley contracted to write a nnovel that at the time the contract was made he had no plot or story or even any idea of one ready and that thereupon he hunted about and took the first that offered this haphazard method of selecting a subject to work upon did not deserve to succeed nor has it ever succeeded though it appears to be the favourite method of writers of the present day probably because it saves trouble how strange it is that nnovelists will not understand the vital importance of first choosing a good story and then telling it in their best fashion instead of acting in the manner suggested they seem to sit down to scribble with the very slightest notion of what their narrative is to be and trust to the brightness of their description and power of depicting lively conversations to compensate for deficiencies in the tale to start with it is always a mistake to found a nnovel upon a true story why this should be the case admits of many explanations but without discussing the reasons for it it is enough for us that it is a fact as is evident when we remember that historical nnovels have hitherto been failures even sir walter scotts historical nnovels were very much inferior to his domestic mdlle mathilde is no exception to the rule throughout the work it is obvious that the author is trammelled by his desire to adhere to the true account of his heroines life as much as possible and that relying too much on this cutanddried narrative he has not allowed himself the free exercise of that power of imagination which is one of his best gifts again the tale itself is too meagre and to compensate for this the author has been obliged to thrust prominently forward a lot of uninteresting and useless personages who bore the readerwilliam the silent for example that  this was inevitable appears at once when we riate what mdlle mathildes history really is this heroineand she was truly onein love with a young englishman and by him beloved sacrifices her own life in the french revolution to save her sisters this is the whole story of course it can be and is magnified to a very great extent but still details however well worked out and however numerous will not alter the story to use a poetical illustration in the fashion of mr weller an engraving by the new indiarubber process may be enlarged indefinitely without in any way adding to or diminishing the number and proportions of the lines in the engraving so here pages may be taken up with details of mathildes life in prison of her falling in love of her fathers servants and other like subjects but they only act as an enlargement of the original tale as we have stated it and we repeat that that tale is meagre lastly every one is tired of the french revolution to hear that a young lady was murdered by a citizen mob of the period hardly moves one so accustomed are we to all kinds of scenes of violence and horror at that time by a perusal of numberless histories we wish some author would for a change give us an idea of the brighter side of the revolution every one hitherto has delighted in painting it as black as he can till a sort of hazy idea wrvades englishmen that a good third of france perished by the guillotine or by murder daring the struggle when we consider the comparatively few who really were killed it is evident that the great mass of french people enjoyed themselves much as usual the whole time if a writer will insist on taking up this revolution again we ask him for the sake of nnovelty to look at it from the point of view here suggested in conclusion we may say that much as we admire mr kingsleys writings we can afford to wait a little longer for his next if he will spend the extra time on the composition of an original and more carefully selected plot,novel
baron montez of panama and paris by a c limiter routledge  sons there is plenty of adventure and excitement in  baron montez mr gunters new nnovel more perhaps than in some of his other stories which to a few folk seemed to make a somewhat unaccountable stir it is a tale of plot and incident covering the rather lengthy period contained between the years 56 and 92 the chief feature of general interest is though great panama canal scheme the speculation intrigue and treachery that centred round it and culminated in the present aspect of french affairs are woven in with the course of the story for particulars it depends on the villainous plots financial and other of the  every nation  man who gives though book its name the author has no style to speak of and little idea of composition or presentation of situations  yet one feels an interest both in what happensand a good deal does happen and in the characters and proceedings of those who do and those who suffer a cosmopolitan flavour hangs over it all as regards language and people the author has a weakness for certain continental words and american expressions alsopetite is a favourite word he talks of petite gossip figures slippers repasts and on one occasion probably a misprint of apetite supper faultless evening dress locate and ten pieces for the renowned thirty pieces of silver also occur but none of these things matters in this sort of storya story sure to be looked on by many as a spirited and stirring one,novel
an immortal soul by w h mallock bell  sons mr mallocks nnovel is a fine piece of irony though the simple will devour it for its sensation the interest radiates from a startling case of dual personality the patient is a young lady miss vivian her stronger self is mannish atheistic and aware of the existence of a disreputable husband her weaker self which conventional people call her real self is neurotic excessively feminine and very religious in a dreamy unpractical way any shock or knock may submerge the self which happens to b uppermost though the mystery of this double life well kept by the accomplished writer may absorb the general reader its primary significance is in its revelation of something in humanity as a whole of which dual personality is only symbolic it is that fickleness of will that momentary amnesia caused by the passions in which ideals vanish to reappear too late mr mallock was something more than a 4i teatable philosopher when he contrasted with the obvious duality of miss vivian the latent selfishness of the rev theophilus barton this quality at the supreme moment of the story submerges his devout idealism and leads him to utter the reproach which causes the heroines worse self to resume command of her mr barton is an admirable portrait of a high church clergyman the subordinate characters are nearly all well drawn,novel

fiction the midnight folk a nnovel by john masefield heinemann 7s 6d while this further incursion into the history of the harker family may satisfy enthusiasts of the masefield cult it must disappoint many readers who usually delight in his work the present writer who opened the book with keen anticipation kept on hoping until he found himself following a willothewisp and finally wondered how mr masefield with all his literary charm had managed to produce so jumbly a story it is called a nnovel but is actually an illconstructed fairytale without fairies which follows the threadbare device of making animals behave and talk exactly as if they were humanneither better nor worse the idea that by putting on a bats wings or an otters skin little kay harker could assume the aquatic or aerial functions of such creatures is more childish than childlike the way in which thrills are avoided in spite of hidden treasure wrecks secret haunts ghosts and witchcraft is truly surprising indeed the whole story with its tangle of dreams magic and simple life is more bewildering than illusive perhaps the best piece of work is the personality of ellen the houseparlourmaid whose account of the capture of the highwayman benjamin and the death of the mare dowsabell fills the five brightest pages,novel
fiction abbots ferney by u macaulay murray 6s r macaulay has written an interesting book her work is sound and careful and illumined by occasional flashes of insight its chief defect is an inclination to diffuseness and her characters at times become dim and even lost in the fog of detail and explanation  its chief quality is absolute sincerity the story is simple and reasonable relying for interest as such a story should upon the play of circumstance on character the three generations of ruths are realised and expressed with admirable distinctness the misery of verney ruth when he becomes involved in the disgrace of his father and is disinherited by his grandfather is finely described and his pride his sensitive reserve his pluck are brought out with great skill though wear unable to sympathise as we seem expected to with his resentment against rosamond for not giving him all when by her strength and kindness she had already given him much we read the book with the interest that real sincerity almost always commands the authors prose is usually good  occasionally it is distressingly harsh as when she writes of  phlegmatic practicality but happily such phrases are rare and we recommend the book without hesitation,novel

lady alice or the new una a tnoroughpaced wellwritten story in advocacy of the church of rome is a nnovelty and attests the purpose which the author argues ought to be sought for by every work of imagination but which he at the same time avers ought not to be exposed at the onset the lovestory to which  this thing professing to be a nnovel aes prominence is connected with the fortunes of frederick clifford whose baronial power dates from the conquest and who more than that  unites two qualifications not generally found in his shopkeeping and heretical countryan incontaminate faith and an immaculate pedigree  and those of the lady alice stuart daughter of the duke of lennox descendant of robert iii king of scotlanda stuart in every sense except dereliction from the faith of her ancestors the parties are first brought together in the small episcopal city of cava situate on the sorrentine peninsula so famous in story the acquaintanceship is renewed at milan at the house of a mediatised prince of the holy roman empire at a banquet given to the duke and duchess of lennox by the prince of santisola on the eve of their departure the lady alice gives a formal and decisive conge to the marquis of wessex to whom she has been affianced since her childhood and that for the sake of frederick clifford with whom she holds a clandestine meeting in the duono where she for the first time partakes of holywater from the tip of her lovers fingers already before  love had come to lend its aid to a wavering impulse alice had felt a passionate enthusiasm for the majesty of worship in the roman church and i the many means of grace the practises of piety the devout and edifying usages which abound in the roman church had taken a deep hold on a heart essentially religious

anna kar enina by john galsworthy tolstoy is a 4ascinating puzzle so singular an t instance of artist and reformer rolled into one frame is not i think elsewhere to be found the leo tolstoy 18261910 preacher in him who took such charge of his later years was already casting a shadow over the artistwriter of  anna karenina there is even an indication of the moralist in the last part of that tremendous nnovel  war and peace about his work in fact is an ever present sense of spiritual duality it is a battlefield on which we watch the ebb and flow of unending conflict the throb and stress of a gigantic disharmony explanation of this mysterious duality must be left to the doctors now that our personalities are controlled by our glands so that if we have plenty of pituitary we are artists and too little adrenalis it  moralists  in choosing a single nnovel to label with those words so dear to the confectioners of symposiums  the greatest ever written i would select  war and peace in it tolstoy rides two themes like a circus rider on his two piebald horses and by a miracle reaches the stable door still mounted and still whole the secret of his triumph lies in the sheer interest with which his creative energy has invested every passage the book is six times as long as an ordinary nnovel but it never flags never wearies the reader and the ground  introduction to  anna karenina in the centenary sedition of tolstoys works which is to be published by the oxford university press of human interest and historical event of social life and national lifecovered in it is prodigious a little but not much behind that masterwork comes  anna karenina also of stupendous length this nnovel contains in the old prince in his daughter kitty in stepan arkadyevich vronsky levin and anna herself six of tolstoys most striking characters he never drew a better portrait than that of stepan arkadvevichthe perfect russian man of the world the writer of this preface has known the very spit of him the opening chapters describing him at an unkind moment in his fortunes are inimitable as for the portrait of annas husband alexev alexandrovichit inspires in us the feelings that he must have inspired in anna the early parts of this great nnovel are the best for i have never been convinced that anna in the circumstances shown would have committed suicide it is as if tolstoy had drawn her for us with such colour and solidity in the beginning that we cannot believe she is not in the end dismissed by him rather than by herself anna in fact is a warm pulsating person with too much vitality to go out as she did the finish strikes one as vonu as if the creator had turned against his creature and one forms aislya aad nikila scene from tolstoys play the power of darkness the opinion that tolstoy started on this book with the free hand of an unlimited sympathy and understanding but during the years that passed before he finished it became subtly changed in his outlook over life and ended in fact a preacher who had set out an artist it is however no uncommon flaw in writers to misjudge the vitality of their own creations an illustration of the same defect is the suicide of paula in  the second mrs tanquerav  ladies with her sort of past have too much vitalitv to put a period to themselves except in plays and nnovels with this reservation  anna karenina is a great stud of russian character and a great picture of russian societyla picture that held good with minor variations up to the war tolstoys method in this nnovel as in all his work is cumulativethe method of an infinity of facts and pictorial detail the opposite of turgenevs who relied on selection and concentration on atmosphere and poetic balance tolstoy fills in all the spaces and leaves little to the imagination but with such vigour such fresh ness that it is all interesting his style in the narrow sense is by no means remarkable all his work bears the impress of a mind more concerned with the thing said than with the way to say it but if one may add to interminable definitions style is the power in a writer to remove all barriers between himself and his reader  the t r i u m p h of style is the creation of intimacy then though such a definition will put many out of court it will leave tolstoy a stylist for no author in h i s storytelling produces a more i n t i m a t e feeling of actual life he is free in fact from the literary selfconsciousness which so often spoils the work of polished wtiters tolstoy was carried away by his impulses whether creative or reformative he

technique and changing h i s asthetic outlook and whose work like his mood is selfconscious and tentative so with the writer only when a t h e m e seizes on him is all doubt about expression resolved and a masterwork produced the prime characteristic of tolstoy as a nnovelist was certainly his unflinching sincerity his resolute exposition of what seemed to him the truth at the moment remembering how he swung between the artist and the moralist we have in that trait at once his strength and his weakness frankly loyal true to the v i s i o n and mood of the moment he had a force that philosophic reflection 1 a c ks together with its corollarydeficient balance his native force is proved by the simple fact that taking up again one of his stories after the lapse of many years one will remember almost every paragraph dickens and dumas are perhaps the only other writers who c o m p a r e with him in this respect the character of levin is undoubtedly a  selbstportrdt or at least a study of the side of tolstoys own nature which was preoccupying him at that period the chapters describing levin in the country are very clearly a r e n de r in g of his own efforts and feelings just count leo tolstoy last photograph from life taken september 99og when he was beginning to be profoundly disturbed about the meaning of life a n d to develop his  peasant  philosophy of c xistence and in this part of the nnovel we again have a feeling of earnest message at the back of portraiture the whole of t o l s t o y  s writing if e indeed after this nnovel is very much of an effort to prove that what he himself felt and saw was what the average man could feel and see and in all this long attempt we are conscious of the distortion which comes when an artist and thinker tries to put himself into the skin of the normal man or rather tries to put the normal man into his own skin a useful illustration of such distortion occurs in one of conrads early stories  the return where a notably matteroffact english husband agonises over his wifes departure illustration to  war and peace kutuzovs last council of war before the abandonment of moscow in t182 in slavonic fashion during many long and intricate pages in the light shed by history a n d m ore recent analysts we must be permitted to doubt whether tolstoy really understood t h e russian peasant whom he e i e v a ted into a sort of arbiter of life and art perhaps he understood them as well as an aristocrat could but he is not so close to the soul and body of russia as chekhov who came of the people and knew them from inside in any case the russia of tolstoys great nnovels  war and peace  and  anna karnina is a russia of the past perhaps only the crust of that russia of the pastnow split and crumbled beyond repair how fortunate we are then to have two such supreme pictures of the vanished fabric,novel
  overshadowed l the shorter poems of frederick tennyson macmillan and co it is probable that few people know the name of frederick tennyson save from the chance connexion of relationship to the great poet laureate for all that he was a poet of no mean ability who but for the eclipsing glory of his brother might conceivably have made a name conspicuous in the history of victorian literature he had unfortunately too retiring a disposition a nature too fond of abstract study and a soul that loved and sought for seclusion such ideals were hardly the right weapons for a fight necessary to make the dense understand the separate identities of his brother and himself and frederick tennyson never tried to do more than please his friends with the poems that were to him one of the easiest methods of expression with no wish for a public reputation the poet did not restrain himself sufficiently ever to get it in his constant use of capitals which to him doubtless conveyed an extra interpretation and significant reality in his vagueness and diffuseness of expression and the frequent antitheses he employed may be traced without especial difficulty the fondness for the abstract that can never make frederick tennyson really popular with any except those who look for poetry to convey to them something beyond a simple story with a moral or a motto and a sweet sense of emotional music frederick tennyson very often does tell a simple story and he very often uses exceedingly sweet lines but in general his style is very different examine a verse from a poem entitled the mountain so from the faroff mount of poesy the worlds great shows like the hushd champaign seem the actual insubstantiality real what is shaped in fancys eager eye fear love a hope a dream it is doubtful if any but real poets will appreciate this stanza with its harshness in places and abstractness of philosophical ideas but there are times when frederick can become as philosophical and as musical as browning take for example these two lines with all the great dreams that lie behind all the possibilities of eternity and all the conceptions that hover behind space climbing into the awful infinite those stairs whose steps are worlds very roughly indeed this is the main trend of ideas that run through this book for we must admit that frequently the theme is monotonous and the poet reiterates in a different manner what he has already expressed it must be understood however that though there are many faults of style and execution in the craft of the poetry yet in itself the poems are those which only one who had soared above the realms of minor poetry could have written,novel
a lifts secret by mrs henry wood 2 vols wood whitten six years since for though pages of a serial this story of love amongst the rich and strikes amongst the poor is now for the first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living nnovelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a nnovelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no good puri posethe very thing which she wishes us to think that she has left undone,novel

macleod of dare macleod of dare by william black macmillan and co it is always a painful thing to watch the gradual decline of a great statesman to hear the voice of the orator which onco enthralled thousands in awestruck attention alter gradually as years go on till a bare handful will listen to his garrulous maunder not out of interest for what he says but from a respectful recollection of what he was mr black was never a great statesman nor a brilliant orator but he wrote two extremely clever nnovels of which the bracing salt breezes came breathing freshness into though readers of mudie over tired as they were of sensational twaddle or prurient millinery in  green pastures and piccadily the author tried a new but a less successful line and  madcap violet could not but leave a most unpleasant impression nothing but his name obtained readers for these two nnovels if they had been written by an anonymous novice they wtould we a enture to assert have soon disappeared in the unknown regions whither bad books go thia last is unfortunately a great deal worse than it3 two predecessors it shows indeed more traces of mr blacks special talent than  green pasturesthere is more gaelic in it and we find plenty of those clouds and hills and boats and sunsets over the lake3 and other wordpainting which in though  princess of thule we took to be genius but which we now find are only a knack but the story is so wildly absurd and improbable the style is so exaggerated and the mixture of scotch gaelic and english so tedious that we lay the book down with two heavy sighs one denotes gratification at having finished it the other regret that a man who once am usd us so well and made us think should now bore us so thoroughly and only succeed in making us yawn sir keith macleod of dare is the son of a mother who strange to say has given birth to four baronets the mystery is explained by the fact that her other sons wrere all killed in succession either in the crimea or by north american indians or on the gold coast or at koniggratz keith though youngest and only surviving one goes to london to enjoy himself and is taken by a friend to the house of a mr3 ross who lives in south kensington here ho is invited to lunch but so light is thc young mans head as were his heels when he jumped out of a capsized hansom en route that even before he has tasted any wine he becomes intoxicated by the cent of flowers the rosecoloured curtains and the soft wees to which he is introduced he oats asparagus soup for luncheon an 1 the result of this dish taken at so untimely an hour is that he entertains a certain lnovely miss vv lute with a multitude of scotch legends for threequarters of an hour in a back room although miss white knows nothing of scotland or singing she entrances keith on their return to the rest of the company by warbling some scotch ditties when they leave the house his friend suggests that they should spend the evening at the piccadilly theatre on the chance of meeting miss white again macleod consent a atd fvjta to nd a n th hi ho inovo for her in the playbill and lo she is there henceforward he gives up all thought of his cousin janette whom his mother was keeping for him at castle dare and his whole object is to make gertrude white his wife this young lady is at first tempted by the prospect of becoming lady macleod but when her sister a precocious damsel of fourteen lectures her on the folly of leaving the stage and sternly opposes the marriage she gives up the idea and turns a cold shoulder on her lover who meanwhile has performed sundry acts of bravery and generosity not the least among the latter is his protection of a small boy who is neglected by his poor parents he takes this boy home to scotland makes a jackofallwork of him and on his return to town calls on johnnys mother to tell her how her son is getting on and after giving her a satisfactory account of him he adds  here is his first quarters wages at the same time munificently handing her the sum of thirteen shillings which lavish generosity of course calls down many blessings on his head major stewart the friend who accompanies our hero on this his second visit to london is decidedly amusing his advice to keith on no account to marry a sigher is good as miss white is obdurate macleod resorts to a stratagem to win her he persuades her to come on board his yacht which is lying in the thames he locks her up in the cabin sets sail and is off to scotland and every one on board seems smitten with silence although gertrude is by no means a willing prisoner and the thames is as full of craft as fleetstreet of carriages he keeps her closely confined till they reach scotland then foreseeing a storm he puts his crew on shore cuts the vessel adrift and is drowned with his beloved in a flash of very forked lightning of course he is quite mad and was probably invented to be a pendant to violet who it will be remembered also became insane from disappointed affection mr black clearly hankers after pairs of nnovels like other people after pairs of candelabra or pairs of horses but we hope we shall be preserved from another nnovel to make up the pair with  green pastures and piccadilly a number of the most eminent artists have been called in to illustrate this book and some of the sketches of rock and sea are excellent but too many cooks have spoilt the picture of the hero macleod mr pettie shows him on the frontispiece in full highland costume about to open or shut a door opposite page 100 he is represented by mr graham leaning on the parapet of the thames embankment and although st pauls and waterloo bridge are beautiful in the distance macleod is not in the least like what he was at the beginning of the book and when he gets home and kisses hamishs granddaughter his appearance is again entirely altered thanks to a third artist who delineates his features this cooperative principle has we think hardly proved successful and we recommend mr black to confine himself to wordpainting in future or if he must have pictures to entrust them all to the same pencil,novel
the belton estate new nnovels by anthony trollope 3 vols i chapman  hall as this story has already appeared in a periodical we may assume that such readers as care for mr trollopes writings are to some extent familiar with it we cannot say that it is equal to many of mr trollopes later works it is one of his stilllife pictures and like most of them deficient in breadth of interest there are fewer characters than usual and with regard to some of the chief personages mr trollopes hand has been restrained by the fear of trenching on parts of his former nnovels one of our contemporaries has observed that while we see the weak side of capt aylmers nature we do not see the attractions which commended him at first to clara amedroz we think this omission is owing to the attempt on mr trollopes part at guarding against any repetition of plantagenet palliser in like manner the domestic arrangements of aylmer castle put us almost in mind of those with which the de coureys made us familiar mr trollopes skilful workmanship of course enables him to avoid any actual repetition  but there is too much similarity in the motive the plot of  the belton estate turns as so many of mr trollopes plots turn on the love of two men for the same woman and on the way in which the characters of the two men are contrasted this time there is a more pointed contrast than usual as no two men could be further apart from each other than will belton and capt aylmer and the two men join issue very strongly in the scene at the great northern hotel the colourless politeness of capt aylmer and the broad vigour of will belton make up a scene that is more than usually dramatic but in working up this scene so vigorously mr trollope has gone a little too far we agree with capt aylmer in reprobating the swagger of will belton butwe do not understand how any nineteenthcentury young lady could let her admiration of outspoken frankness predominate over natural womanly instinct surely no young lady could either wish to be brawled for at an hotel dinnertable or pardon an unsuccessful lover for parading his misfortune before his successful rival yet mr trollope makes this scene the turningpoint in the fortunes of his hero it is his object to show us rude nature vanquishing tame conventionalism but rude nature appears to some disadvantage when it can do nothing more than swagger in the early days when such defiance in word would have been sue ceeded by a combat h voutrance wm belton would have been our own as well as the ladys hero but when we have only the defiance and the deeds of chivalry are confined to breaking a wineglass we are too sensible of the discrepancy the story drags during most of the nwt volume and the verdict of periodical readers was we believe unfavourable but we have a decided improvement in the second volume and there are detached scenes in  the belton estate which rise above mr trollopes ordinary level,novel
i strictly tied up 3 vols hurst and blackett       11  evidently by an irishman this nnovel is most iulln written though the story is often forgotten by the author or allowed to drag while he dashes gaily along saying what he has to say mrs foulis a young heiress and the wife of a month is left a widow at seventeen and at thirtyfour finds herself mother of a grownup daughter on whom she believes her money to be strictly tied up the daughter cold and cunning yet stupid allows her self to be run away with by a scheming patchedup baronet of fiftyeight who imagines he is winning a rich prize and little thinks that his son is meanwhile making love to the widow how the latter coy and prim and sweet distressed at the ingratitude and deceit of her daughter and alone and lonely allows herself to be won by the revising barrister and how after the marriage ceremony they find out that the money is only tied up on the daughter in default of a male heir and how they acquaint the scheming baronet and his sulky bride of this and how they settle money on their belongings all round and are at last rewarded by the birth of a son to inherit the tiedup money is all most amusingly told the sketch of lady foulisville and her repeated failures is well drawn and it seems almost unconsciously on the authors part is exceedingly pathetic the irish scenes are perhaps the best things in the book and the account of the embassy to nicholas macswinny the miller is told with vigour and humour with a little more story and conversation the conversations are few and many of them disappointing this would have been an excellent nnovel as it is the padding is so bright and fresh that one forgets to be angry with the author for not getting on fast enough,novel

heaping the whirlwind a nnovel 3 vols by mrs mackenzie daniel newby this nnovel is quite equal to the reputation which mrs mackenzie daniel has acquired it is well written full of good principle and an interesting story though the character of meta would have been made more natural if the details of her wiles and wickedness had been worked out at greater length the married experience of ethel wyke is the most lifelike and true portion of the book her morbid jealousy is extremely clear and well managed for the selfcreated misery is not unmercifully prolonged the love of guy for meta is intended to be a passionate affair and to furnish the reason for the ominous title of  reaping the whirlwind whether mrs mackenzie daniel was afraid of dealing with the sensational element or whether she thought it bad for her readers we do not know but the portion that concerns metas previous life and all that appertains to her subsequent marriage is very tamethe promise of her first appearance is not kept up nevertheless reaping the whirlwind  is a nnovel worth reading  our library table reaping timewhirlwind a nnovel in i three volumes by mrs mackenzie daniel t cautley newby 30 welbechstreet cavendiuh squarewanting the force and passion which the title leads us to expect and for the true working out of which the authoress held all the elements in her band reaping the whirlwind is nevertheless a welltold story of considerable power and exhibits the writers knowledge of the better nature of her sex in a marked and intelligent manner nothing can be more real more loveable and womanly than the character of ethel beamisb nothing more true to nature than the imaginary sorrows of her early married lifeher aching jealousy her morbid fears for the continuance of her husbands love her exigence which arises not from selfishness so much as from her own excess of affection  and as time passes on the gradual recognition of her husbands true regard and of the rationale of wedded life with gertrude her sister we cannot profess much sympathy she walks apart even by the side of an only and younger sister and makes us feel the coldness of her selfcontained and haughty nature repelling from the very firs but the inhabitant of primrose cottage and the two maiden sisters the miss downings and their niece andproteghe jane norton are charmingly real and with all the miching mallecho of the lively little widow mrs vivian and the peculiarities of the spinsters pleasant persons in village society but mrs mackenzie daniel shall describe them herself miss downing wu a lady of about forty years of age with a tall statoly figure and the remains of considerable personal attractions she was strongminded healthy energetic and of very decided literary tastes wbilch had more than once induced her it was said to open a correspondence with the editor of a local paper and to offer to supply both the poetry and the leading articles on very moderate terms as well as to regale the editor who lived at boltby with tea and toast whenever he felt inclined to walk as far as graybourne no one seemed very clear as to the result of these overtures but miss downing was always suspoeted of being the author of several heroic and didactic compositions which from time to time had appeared in the poets corner of the shire instructor and which were signed semiramis in temper and disposition min downing was really a pattern to elderly spistore in general being cheerful contented an as far as a pared on the surface entirely reconciled to her lot the little widow at primrose cottag said inded that she had by no means relinquised all hope of escaping from the despised sisterhood yet but then that little widow wasnt a bit eharitable towards other women and could not quite forgive harriet downing for looking so well and handsome at forty years of age the second sister miss dors was anlnvaid ad tve romantic she had long fair hair which she wore in ringlets that wen always out of curl and somewhat wiry in texture but her blue eyes were soft and pensive and there were some sweet tones in her low and rather melancholy voice which united with her general appearance and invalid state gave her a claim to be reckoned by most persons of the other sex as an interesting woman jane norton the niece whom thes kindhearted t idies had adopted on the death of her ppenbt was a brighteyed girl of about eighteen not pretty not graceful certainly not clever and yet with a qusint odd charm about her that it would be very idifcult to define her aunts were very fond of her and allowed her to do exactly what she pleased and the consequence was she did nothing when site was not playing with the cat but a little needtle work on her own account and spent altogether as idle and profitless a life as could well be imagined her fat good humour keen observance and love of softfurred animal pets culminating in her affection for  blabberty cutsoms a pet dormouse makes her in mrs mackenzsie daniels hands quite a character it is only where the wicked people with their wicked ways come on the stage of the story that though author dwarfs her own conceptions and disappoints the expectations of her readers by her evident fear of entering the list of the sensationalist but the character of meta belongs of right to that class of nnovels and loses half its vigour by being transposed to the calm fore ground of respectable domesticity her un scrupulous deeds lack action and become tame enough when recorded at second hand also her lover guy who is meant to represent the unreasoning recklesness of a blind infatuated illregulated passion exhibits no passion what ever in the presence of the reader but is in point of fact boyih and weak and insipid enoughl to conciliate us to his wifes indifferece her actire wickedness degenerates in the last volume into a weaknes for brandyandwater and involves guy who for love of her had given up the profession of the church and the aspiration of his genius in the gathering of the weird harvest which she had sown and which gives the title to these volumes walter kenyon the spoiled darling of fashionthe man of good impulses

was about to commence reading a tale of terrible interestof hulnan frivolity and sin followed by overwhelming shame and sufferingof cruelty and wrong triumphant for a time but overtaken at last and clutched by the dread avenger but instead of passion we have pietyinstead of licence unchecked we have tutored lives running carefully in the most conventional grooves and  the whirlwind so far as we can see has yet to be reaped the saints in mrs mckenzie daniels nnovel are many but the sinners indeed are few there is not a good thoroughgoing scamp in the whole book and the little fairhaired clever german girl who does the flirting and is for her very pardonable love of admiration supposed to  reap the whirlwind is thrown among a set so intensely proper and milkandwaterish that we regard the poor thing as more sinned against than sinning mrs daniels books will always be welcome at the dorcas society and often read aloud no doubt to the members thereof much to their edification but if she wishes to address that wider audience which is called the public she must make her books more human and the first step in that direction would be to make her country rectors men as well as parsons here is an outline of the story mrs beamish is the widow of a country clergyman and not being left particularly well off she agrees that her two daughters gertrude and ethel having finished their education should open a boardingschool in the large house at lindenhurst which the generosity of a friend had enabled them to take with this end in view arrangements had been made with their german cousin meta kauffman for her coming over to england and joining them in the labours of the school the two sisters have not yet finished their own education when they receive a letter from their mother announcing the rather sudden arrival of this german cousin and soliciting the return of one or other of them immediately in order that the stranger in a strange land might not be without a companion this letter rather puzzles the sisters at first but the younger of the two who is the teller of the whole story guesses very properly to this effect  it is simply as it seems to me that meta kauffman has turned out to be a young lady of sufficient personal and mental attractions to make a dangerous 1eteatete companion day after day for our sensitive if not susceptible brother and mamma who is easily frightened catches hold of the first straws that she sees floating towards her in this dire extremity if aleta had only been content to remain in her happy fatherland a few weeks longer guy would have been safe at cambridge and you and i quite free to devote ourselves to the young persons entertainment by the time ethel arrives however the mischief is done and her impressionable brother guy is the adoring slave of the goldenhaired meta the cousin moreover never joins in the school but accepts a situation as governess in a neighbouring family to which she is recommended by mrs arnott a lively young widow whose acquaintance she has converted into a friendship the fascinating manners and wonderful singing of the new governess gain the good opinions of every one and it is even whispered that young edmund hallam heir to the earldom of clinton thinks more of her than he does of alicia clarkson the young lady to whom lhe is engaged in the meantime the two sisters open school with three or four pupils among whom is included little maggie the delicate child of the new rector his visits become frequent and result in his engagement to ethel he is a grave man of middle age superhumanly modest and saintlike in his piety ethels affection for hin is also of the supernal kind she does not so much love as worship him meta kauffmans engagement as governess at the vivians ends abruptly and she returns to the sisters in disgrace it is now that the rev harold wvyke sees her and looking at her for the first time and much to his astonishment he recognises in meta kauffman mrs alan beresford to whose dying husband at heidelberg he had administered the last sacrament some four years ago on discovering the frivolity of her nature he had very soon repented of his marriage and in order that lie might ultimately shake her off he had persuaded her that that marriage was an irregular one and their little boy illegitimate this he told the clergyman when dying and that that same little boy whom he had placed with maiden aunts of his in devonshire was the real heir to the earldom of clinton it was for seducing the affections of edmund hallam the supposed heir to the earldom that meta was disgraced and now that she discovered that she herself was the mother of the future earl she loses no time in writing to the man whom she had betrayed disclaiming all future connexion with him and starts at once for devonshire to recover her lost boy this journey into devonshire where we pur posely leave the reader and the discovering of alan earl of clinton is by far the most powerfully written part of the 1ook and perhaps the most touching thing mrs daniel has yet written the various scenes with maggie too are all genuine transcripts from nature so no doubt re the teaparties but the eternal twaddle of a v tage the gossip of the old maids and the visits u the parson are not exactly the things with which a threevolume nnovel with any pretensions in it ought to be filled reaping the whirlwind is an advance upon miriams sorrow which we reviewed some time ago but if mrs daniel means to become a real artist she must broaden her canvas and work for the world at

new nnovels the son of hoy al langlrith by w d howells harper  brothers lack of breadth alone has prevented mr howells from becoming a great nnovelist he has all the minor equipments and many of the major he has a very strong sense of character and at one time at least he had a sense of a story alas that time is somewhat faded out of sight and remembrance but the days of  a foregone conclusion  the lady of the aroostook and  a chance acquaintance are not to be forgotten and if mr howells has in later years wandered afield under the influence of a theory he shall yet be forgiven much because we have loved much it is breadth of view that is wanting even in his best work he has easy toleration he is fair and equitable but he leaves on one the impression of a provincial rawness which certainly does not characterise his acute intellect is it his ohoice of themes is it his treatment we feel that his suave and delicate handling is not rude enough or virile enough for the purpose we want force a little swashbuckling would not come amiss a little strong language would make us prick up our ears but we only get the gentlemanly voice dissecting nice qualities and nice issues nicely and in the most proper and respectful way there is a lack of the fullness of human blood and therefore of human character and therefore again an insufficient and inefficient view of life this last book is a very characteristic specimen of mr howellss work its 368 pages hang on a mere nothing yet the subtlety of the art involves ones interest in them and in issues which really do not matter stated baldly does this sound a fullblooded theme for treatment  a successful man dies during his sons infancy leaving a widow who for nineteen years remains a widow he was a bad man but his son has grown up to think him a noble character the mother cannot be induced to reveal the fathers character yet her sons devotion to that fathers memory keeps her from marrying the man of her choice the solution in mr howellss hands is at once tragic and practical he is always practical and the reader must perforce take an interest in the problem but it is a trivial problem it would have done very well once in a way but alas mr howells is always doing it,novel
  lady jim of curton street by fergus hume werner laurie it is a pleasure to be able unreservedly to recommend thia book the characters are all so well drawn that to have read it is as it were to have added to the number of ones acquaintance nature had intended lady jim for a queen amongst women but somehow she got marred in the making and when the reader is introduced to her she is a modern circe insatiable in pursuit of the material pleasures of lifo and unscrupulous in her methods of attaining them these lead her to fraudulent dealings with her husbands lifeinsurance and a callous betrayal of the man who has risked all to help her a terrible retribution follows and we close the book with a sense of the due proportion of all things which is at once stimulating and soothing the dialogue is all through of the cleverest and the plot is well conceived and elaborated  lady jim of curzon street by fergus flume os iwerner laurie so long as mr fergus flume keeps close to his plot hi story is interesting the central idea is ingenious and he develops it very cle erlv to an end that is new and ktriking though a little too horrible to be in harmony with a romance of this type it is only when he gives us incidental full length picture of high society that mr hume cease to interest us his smart talk is not really smart his epigrams are forced and feeble or too often admittedly quoted there is so much of quotation in the book that frankly one gets rather irritated by it the plot i suggested to lady jim by the plot of  the woman in white but one makes no objection to this for a quite fresh plant is grown from the old seed what one wearies of in the description of one character asi resembling dora in david copperfield of another as being like thackeravs beckv sharp of the wink of another being as eloquent a ord lurleighs headshake in  the critic act ii scene x  and so forth we refer to these small blemishes in the hope of inducing mr fergus hume not to resort again to such ineffectively pretentious methods there is an art in writing good sensational nnovels but a free display of ones acquaintance with standard and classical literature is no part of it and this story is in itself so cunningly contrived and so successfully gives one the surprise of an unexpected turn towards the end that we are the more devoutly moved to wish its superfluous trimmings had been judiciously cut away,novel
sink or sivim a nnovel new nnovels by the author of  recommended to mercy 3 vols tinsley brothers the author of  recommended to mercy has put so much sound work into the present story which considerably exceeds the limits of an ordinary nnovel and the book contains so many passages which exhibit more than average artistic capability that no reader will question its right to honourable mention amongst the tales of the current season the work however has faults of construction and in other respects falls so far short of a high standard of excellence that it must be commended rather for its promise of better things than for actual achievement by bold excision it might have been made a nnovel of a very superior class and with all its amendable shortcomings it deserves respectful judgment and will obtain a measure of popularity it consists of two parts which though they are made to dovetail and support each other are less intimately connected than the parts of a nnovel should be the one part concerns the doings of an aristocratic family whose influence on the movements of the drama is not in proportion to the prominence given to its history the other and more satisfactory division introduces us to the domestic circle of a prosperous farmer who marries the heroine of the tale and thereby makes acquaintance with the troubles which are the chief source of the readers interest to the firstmentioned section of the work far too much space is given for instance all that concerns cecil vavasour occupies room to no purpose since he personally contributes just nothing to the action of the play in which one and only one of his children is a chief actor and though it comprises much of the work on which the writer has expended his best labour the record of lady millicents arrogant temper and fireside tyranny should have been curtailed or altogether suppressed in this judgement the author is not likely to concur for his chief purpose is to interest the reader in her ladyships insolent nature and paltry ambition and to accomplish this end he has worked upon her portraiture with a zeal which is incompatible with a just appreciation of her unimportant influence on the other characters of the story the second section of the work is far more successful warm praise is due to all that concerns john beacham the blunt honest intelligent farmer and horsedealer thc superficial refinement of whose foolish wife is skilfully contrasted against the rustic homeliness and asperity of her motherinlaw who whilst she feels that john has lessened the respectability of the beachams by marrying a woman of honour blakes equivocal position is incensed by the personal graces and spurious gentility of the girl who was nothing better than a governessand on inquiry is found to have been the offspring of illicit love no sooner does honour learn that she is the illegitimate child of col norcott whom john beacham bas very properly thrashed within an inch of his life than she becomes ashamed of her honest husbands plebeian manner and tone andbaseborn daughter of a battered blackleg though she beregards herself as degraded through her matrimonial connexion with an illiterate farmer  the very sound of her parents voice says the author describing honors feelings towards the father from whom she never received a single demonstration of paternal kindness and who announces his relationship to her only that he may get power over her husband  low and measured the almost womanly beauty of his soignces hands the marvellous details of his dressingcase his ivory hairbrushes why had not john a dressingcase and beautiful handles like those instead ofbut what need is there to dwell either on honest johns shortcomings or on the thousand and one details which absurd and improbable as it may seem went far towards working a revolution in honors feelings and sent her back to her husbands side an altered and worse than discontented woman ashamed of her husband and furious against her motherinlaw honour flies from john beachams roof and is in a fair way to become arthur vavasours victim when through no circumstances that entitle her to respect or in any degree lessen the wickedness of her conduct she is aved from the act which would have resulted in her banishment from decent society and is restored to the arms of her husband who accords her past errors a full and generous forgiveness which unless we judge her too severely she will sooner or later repay with ingratitude the only thing which can be urged in behalf of honors badness and meanness is that they increase our goodwill towards her honest husband john beacham is a capital fellow who will not soon disappear from the memory of any one who makes his acquaintance in a nnovel which without ever sinking beneath does not upon the whole swim high above the level of ordinary merit,novel
three popular nnovelists uncle sam in the eyes of his family by john erskine 7s 6d putnams mr john erskine has borrowed the  cartoon figure of uncle sam to fill the role of hero in his latest nnovel  i have long believed that this figure might be filled out into a complete character endowed with an inner as well as a public career our national temperament that is might have a biography since no one else has attempted it i here try my hand so says mr erskine in his foreword  uncle sam  is the kind of book with which to settle down in an armchair with the curtains drawn the fire burning red and a november fog blasting the world outside its satirical humour turns a grey world gay it is like a visit to the picturesthe silent oneswith an organ playing softly in the distance picture after picture glides swiftly across the screen too swiftly they are there and then they are gone the transit has been so swift the captions flicker on and off again uncle sam is a convincing symbol of the best american spirit its push its resourcefulness its bulldog grip uncle sam is so deliciously human the reader sorrows when he is sad and laughs when he rejoices here is a new friend to be added to the list of fiction affinities uncle sam lingers in the mind like a pleasant dream one would hate to forget him the dramatisation of  some european opinions of our country  alone makes the book worth reading they are rich with dry humour,novel
  sebastian strome if the object of writing nnovels is to supply readers with amusement then mr julian hawthorne has failed lamentably for a more disagreeable book has scarcely ever been written if its object be to instruct and improve then he has failed still more egregiously for his squinting hero is a slangy selfconscious prig to the end and he paints his melodramatic villain in such very black colours and hates him so cordially himself that the reader is tempted to detest the former and pity the latter only if the authors object be to bring the sensational drama of the old adelphi and the transpontine stage into the quiet study or bright drawingroom has he succeeded perhaps better than even he supposes we can detect in  sebastian strome  many points of likeness to that old friend who used to make beardless youths alternately thrill and shiver and send nervous women into hysterics there is the same delight in describing magnificent parks and gorgeous mansions and the same ignorance of the ways and manners of people who live in them miss denes park consists of three thousand acres of undulating turf studded with trees and is therefore two miles and a quarter in length and in breadth she is seen dimly in the long vista of her drawingroom or the labyrinth of her conservatory where plaintains form a luxuriant shade is the favourite place for secret interviews with her lovers so vast are its recesses yet this lady allows her scotch gardener to reproach her with marrying a person of jewish descent because the jews crucified our saviour and does not think even to herself of the very obvious retort that our saviour was himself one of the chosen nation in mr hawthornes book smokingrooms of clubs are still the abode of wit and humour and the secret  star chambers  above them places where fortunes are habitually won and lost the mere upholstery in sebastians roomsthe very fact that a heavy velvet tortre separated his bedchamber from his parlour would have betrayed to an experienced reader and playgoer that he could not but be a seducer of women and the authors thorough acquaintance with the city and with the ways of jewish firms like fawley and co as well as his exquisite and delicate humour are fully displayed when he makes fawley senior pronounce  gentleman  shentlziman and take ten per cent from his son on a loan of five thousand pounds than which a happier touch more true to nature could not be imagined if however mr hawthorne proves in the above examples how well he knows the ways of landed proprietors clubs and financiers his intimate familiarity with the inner life of a rectory is fairly staggering there is a clergyman in a rural but populous parish who takes an extremely warm interest in a slightly frivolous female member of his flock for no other reason than because he baptised her and this interest is so overpowering that he is with difficulty restrained from making off to london in a snowstorm to search for the erring lamb although on a moderate calculation hie must in the thirty years of his ministration have baptised many thousand infants of the softer sex and would therefore have to cherish equally the memories of that number of ladies married or unmarried in his ample bosom when the young wonman is broutlit to the rectory the worthy old gentlcmian is allowed to remain in the roomn while something is going on during which even husbands are usually excluded  and although the doctor foresees that a new inhabitant is going to  sebastian strome by julian iianrflorne richard bentley and son be ushered into the world he does not think it necessary to urge on the rector the propriety of retiring both hero and villain have of course a mysterious secret that of the former is soon solved but like in all melodramas the eventuallyrighteous though at first distinctlyobjectionable hero retains a power over the villain with which he smites him when the moment has come au this is in the approved surrey style and we can only wonder that so clever a man as sir hawthorne should condescend to it people flock in thousands to musichalls and similar places of entertainment to see acrobats going through all sorts of extraordinary distortions they walk on their hands double themselves up over ropes turn somersaults through rings and tie themselves into knots the attitudes they assume while going through these eccentric and frequently dangerous exercises are not by any means graceful nor do they serve any useful purpose yet they  draw  and elicit thunders of applause sebastian strome reminds us of these feats it is a singular per  formance and an extremely unpleasant one but being nasty and we confess a remarkable display of human ingenuity it is sure to count its readers by thousands for of course the singularity and strength of the book lies not in mr hawthornes acquaintance with the ways of different classes of society of which we have already quoted examples but in the extraordinary incidents and in the undoubtedly powerful descriptions of character possessed of so facile a pen and endowed with so brilliant an imagination it is a thousand pities that he should allow both to run riot if kept in proper bounds he might have produced a book true to real life and nature as it is there are even in this tissue of exaggerations and improbabilities out of which only the most impossible and farfetched coincidences could at last afford an issue many touches betraying the master and showing that mr hawthorne is capable of really good work nothing for instance could be truer and at the same time more pathetic than the scene between mother and son when sebastian tells his mother that he is guilty of the act which she and her husband have been speaking and thinking of with such deep horror her immense confidence in her son is thus destroyed at one blow and she tells him that but a few weeks before she could not have believed herself capable of acknowledging him as her son after such a discovery but when it comes she loves him more than ever and her deep grief does not find vent in a single reproach that an author able to describe the scenes which follow mlr stromes death with so much tenderness and with such a power of analysis of the most delicate recesses of a womans heart should in the exuberance of his strength rush off into the slums of whitechapel should find no better means of getting rid of his characters than a railway accident which kills two and a runaway horse which disposes of another is matter for astonishment and regret of the important personages of this nnovel no less than four lose their senses at one time or another during the book two onlymrs strome and smillettare apparently sane throughout yet although the latter always speaks as if he were in perfect mental health he acts like a madman in leaving the heroine with her dead husband and rushing off to the crimea without whispering a word to anyone of the terrible scene lhe has witnessed the reason given for this eccentric conduct is absurdly insufficient and the manner in which he sebastian and prout are brought together in the trenches before sebastopol is as improbable as it is forced as in ladies nnovels there arc always snug government appointments available for meritorious young men and the ease with which strome obtains a  diplomatic  post in the crimea is as remarkable as the diplomatic business he had to transact there is mysterious and though mr hawthorne recklessly discards probability and throws all the ordinary natural rules overboard in order to get his puppets into dramatic situations and cut knots of his own tying he is not careful enough to avoid contradicting himself in the first chapter of vol iii we are told that very few people knew where strome lived and they were not among the number who were likely to attend the sale  while a very few pages further on it is stated that strome was soon beyond the furthest limits of the fashionable world wherein for some years he had cut no inconsiderable figure again we are informed early in the book that miss denes estates were settled on herself and children and that her husband would have no power over them yet she sells them within a few days of his death to pay his debts to a bank of which he himself was tartner the whole book in short shows a fervid imagination and great cleverness but also haste extravagance and a total want of balance we believe that if mr hawthorne had put the ms aside and taken it up again after six months he would have entirely recast his work and would then have produced a really good nnovel instead of a tissue of impossibilities barely redeemed by the extraordinary talent which marks some chapters,novel

which eliall it be a nnovel new nnovels 3 vols bent ley if we call this a remarkable nnovel it is less for what it performs than for what it promises in itself it is rather a series of studies than a finished work of art and the reader will find it a curious study rather than an interesting nnovel there is indeed nothing singular in its being evidently the first work of a young authoress whose hand is not yet certain and vfho begins by reproducing what has impressed her in life as well as in literature as in raphaels early sketches the pencil seems almost to wander over the paper till it is arrested by an idea the author begins undecidedly reminds us at first of a great many writers who have drawn their inspiration more or less directly from mr dickens and shows throughout the book a partiality for the types discovered by f g trafford but in this there is nothing strange what is peculiar to the book is the skill with which some characters are drawn while a great many others have neither outline nor individuality neither nnovelty nor nature remarkable too is the incisive cleverness of some sentences and the rarity of its appearance we have marked down some epigrams that would do credit to a practised writer yet they are followed by careless grammatical blunders by slips of the pen and slips of the memory which bear the surest witness to inexperience it is plain to us that the author has drawn for her characters on knowledge limited in range but sure within its own province and has supplied the want which she cannot fail to notice by deductions from the premises found in other nnovelists if in future she will observe for herself and not make experiments where her own powers fail her she may not have the same ease in filling up her canvas but she will produce a more harmonious picture as an instance of the singular contrast between her two classes of characters we would put old mrs redman by the side of madame de fontarce nothing can be weaker more tedious or more hackneyed than the first and nothing could produce a worse impression than the opening chapter the reader who stumbles on this old hag is not at all unlikely to close the book at once and for ever yet if he perseveres a little he finds an entire change madame de fontarce nee blake de baltyshanahan is not only a new character but is drawn with consummate art her outward appearance and her menage are not new to us but her religious principles her cheap charity her way of living on others and dying for them are sketched to perfection when she writes to mrs redman that she is willing to take charge of the heroine madeline digby how prettily she adds that mrs redman is to assist in the matter of outfit and as mrs redman is a stingy old person she hints  i append this slight stipulation knowing the noble pride of an englishwoman who would not devolve all the natural responsibilities on another i what delicacy there is in her artless suggestions al ont madeline digbys religion to her own director and to the good sisters with whom she places her young kinswoman but the best touch of all is where she is trying to arrange a match for madeline and the affair is aided by the young man seeing his intended i acknowledge says madame de fontarce the inconvenience of having a husband absolutely in love with you it is of course a restraint and delays that settling down to an everyday condition which is so desirable but of course it would not last long and it might throw a good deal of power into your hands how the author who could draw such a character as this can condescend to repeat wornout types such as mrs redman and mrs john and thc okeefehow she can transplant hugh elliott from mrs riddells nnovels and dudley ashurst from all the romances that have ever boon writtenwould be a mystery to us but for the explanation we find in her youth and newness even the introduction of madame de fontarce shows artistic inexperience there is a poverty in devising links of connexion a french teacher tells madeline digby that she met a lady in france whose eyes resembled madelines and that she presumed on this resemblance to ask if the owners of the eyes were not related then again madeline meets an old gentleman in an omnibus who asks her name starts and leaves her f0000 in the third volume she meets another old gentleman in an omnibus who pays her fare and marries her at the encl of the third volume the example set in this way is taken almost too readily by the other characters who are  polished off in two pagrs but although a  mature writer  would hardly fall into this mistake the repetition of such simple incidents as meetings in an omnibus is still more significant the male personages for whom no original can be assigned are marked by very strong external peculiarities and an utter want of corresponding mental characteristics indeed men dn not come out well in the nnovel they are either heroes of romance or sheer vulgarities one sentence in the book might be taken as typical of the general run of its characters madeline says of lady rawson and mrs john redman that there is a slight likeness a look a sort of physical resemblance only lady rawson is furnished with one or two items omitted in mrs johnbrains and a heart for instance the comparison is not very good as to the two ladies but it describes the method with which the author constructs the characters with which she is not personally familiar one block serves for a great many but the dresses are different and to one she gives a modicum of heart to another the same modicum of brains to another gifts of singing to another fashionable connexions we do not like to linger on these failings when the success of other parts j is so decided but it is easy to feel the success i and the author will be more benefited by  knowing the faults into which she has fallen  she has bestowed most pains on the character  of madeline digby ana her labour has not  been wasted yet the result is that we have two or three living women in a world of ob  noxious lay figures the girl at school who boasts of her pa being rich why ive seen buy your umbrellas at summers written on the dead walls all round stoke newington the young lady who plays a piece with no particular tune but full of sharps and flats nnd shakesthe humble companion with her preparation of herbs  ninepence a packet and it makes a bottleful which lasts a fortnight much cheaper than a doctor and highly recommended in the advertisementmadeline digbys own remark on being advised to marry a curate  you spoke exactly as the people at shoolbreds do when you ask for french merino and they assure you they have coburg at 20s less that will answer the purpose just as well are good specimens of the clever conversation alism for which wo have given the author credit the carelessness with which much of the book is written lends an additional grace to these smarter sayings for it leaves us to infer that the author might be really brilliant if she took the trouble the same pains that would avoid such phrases as  a venial barthat would not marry off a jessie moorcroft at p 21 of the second volume and marry her again at p osthat would not turn out simple sentences without either head or tailwould give more polish to writing that is even now commendable and would intensify liveliness into epigram,novel
i who is the heir by mortimer collins 3 vols maxwell mr collins has written three clever volumes but something more than clever writing is needed to make a nnovel we want a consistent story an atmosphere in which people might move and people in whom we might believe nor is the void filled up by brilliant writing and wealth of apt quotationby allusions to every passing event whether secret or notoriousand by pictures of a luxury that would be overpowering if it was not impossible we admit that these are pleasant elements in any kind of work but we nave had so much of them already that we cannot give undiminished praise to their repetition all these strawberry breakfasts and dark dreamy eyes and latin mses worthy of catullus and peaches and pines and crystal bowls of ice and fretted flasks of marvellous vintages are delightful to read about for a time but after all they pall upon us is it so certain that the people who can indulge in such luxuries retain their appetite to the last  are not half of them dyspeptic or blasts or born without a taste and afraid to show the defect mr collins has endowed all his heroes with the capacity of guy livingstone  but the only result is that he reminds us too much of that undesirable type without emulating the wickedness or the blackguardism of mr lawrences men mr collins borrows too much of their marvellous strength and indulgence there is an atmosphere shed over his story as if he was inspired by recollections of those nnovels just as his sprightly dialogue reminds us of  wheat and tares or  late laurels we are gradually led to the conclusion that we have before us a man of ability wanting to see what he can do by a mixture of two or three styles that have pleased him and have taken with the public the keynote has been struck by mr disraeli who has evidently a great admirer and a loving student in mr mortimer collins perhaps it would have been well if the disciple had not followed his master so faithfully in one of his characteristics the personalities which flavour who is the heir are as little concealed as any of mr disraelis portraitures no one can fail to recognise cheiron and caversham roxham and dalmeida but when mr collins comes to his own immediate circle of acquaintances to men who are not so conspicuous in the great world a the leaders of the two houses he ought to have adopted more disguise young wynyard powys and others of the same age will hardly care to see themselves at mudies except on their own titlepages and the world at large which scarcely knows their titlepages will see that it is kept out of some secret and will resent the superfluous mystery there is an attempt at a story in  who is the heir and though mr collins apologises for not keeping up a mystification like mr wilkie collins or mr sheridan le fanu he does keep one up till an advanced part of the third volume we shall not tell it nor even hint at it as we are pretty well practised in nnovelreading and have our idea about the legitimate sources of plot in fiction we will only say that some of the mysteries are too absurd and some of the means of detection too simple the abduction of lily luttrel for instance is too great a tax on the readers credulity and the sham claim on the mauleverer estates is too sham to impose on the most credulous the episode of the bagman hearing that a rich widow was staying at a farmhouse and making up his mind that by asking shelter there he would gain her hand is beneath so clearsighted an author as mr collins but story is not his strong point he excels in description and he is felicitous in dialogue we could quote many epigrams from the three volumes light graceful verses happy hits in prose which would make the fortune of a stupid nnovel mr collins is one of those tories whose political principle is opposition to the rising classes one of those menjrho believe in good blood in chivalry and polish and who would therefore keep down j the young men who have not yet made their proofs of all the three in favour of the older men who have tried to make their proofs and failed yet we ought not to despair of mr collinss conversion his chief hero guy luti trel almost a namesake and more than almost i a reminiscence of guy darrell gives up politics  england and his future because his faith in i toryismhas suddenly been shaken theheroine i who had agreed to be his wife says she must  give him up because she cannot marry any one but a tory  the ashleighs have always been tories and i have always felt as if people who were not tories belonged to some different race and he goes off to africa but his plunge into the desert ocean strengthens him and he comes back to win her convinced that the world has profounder ideas than toryism or whiggery we hope mr collinss plunge into the ocean of nnovels will have the same effect on him  wkino is the ieir a nnovel by mortimer collins two vols maxwell  co the principal incidents in this story are so peculiar and arise from such an extraordinary group of characters that to disentangle the web is not easy at the same time these volumes are pleasant reading and for those who derive an agreeable little excitement in turning over of a new page ample gratification is provided the paper being nice and creamy the type clear and the lines abundantly leaded politics poetry and the literary press chancerylane and whitecrossstreet electioneering strategy clever chief constables and prizefighters love romance and fast young ladies all seem as one to mr collins facile pen which passes from one subject to another with an airy but not an original grace that induces a genuine regret that he does not confine his really artistic power of word painting whether of character or scenery in a smaller frame and throw the forces of his knowledge and imagination into the plot of his nnovel and its consistent development the excuse for this want of unity is that  who is the heir  was served up originally piecemeal in the dudbln university magazine the mauleverers are a peculiar race of men three of whom are presented to the reader in the first chapter hugh the father is a fine vigorous voluptuary of sixty who has been twice married and has a son by each marriage his second wife however having run away from him he is again in love  with a sweet cyclamen of the apennines to see this flower he determines to revisit italy and summonses his two sons from london to mauleverers park to announce his intended journey and the probability that he will never return hugh the younger the elder of the two is forty years of age harry the son of the runaway wife is twentyone all remarkable for their great personal beauty and towering height while there also exists another son a captain adderly whose similarity in every respect to harry causes that young man considerable perplexity the mystery as to the heirship of mauleverer therefore is within this web where it is but right we should let it remain and turn to the more comeatable and real persons in the story lord riverdale a tory statesman and lady vivian ashleigh his beautiful daughter and heiress surrounded by all the refinements of life are nicely sketched they reside at riverdale castle and this lady mr mauleverer wishes one of his sons to marry each has an entanglement of his own which precludes this object made manifest to the earl in a letter from mr mauleverer and the earl having no disguises from his clearheaded lnovely child passes the missive into her hands as they sit at a luxurious breakfast table another letter with an  almost illegible address is decyphered for vivians benefit it being from a valued friend guy luttrel who has not been well and is coming to the castle for a fortnights holiday how nice  said vivian now thats a man i like and as he isnt a marrying man i suppose one may safely say so whenl is he coming  he came guy luttrel was a distinguishedlooking man of forty a stranger would have been puzzled to discover his occupation but woul have instinctively decided that he must be a firstrate man in his way and indeed guy luttrel might have obtained distinction in any pursuit he had chosen politics not however without trying other experiments he had written the best comedy the best satirical poem and the best social nnovel of the day he was quite a leader of fashion without seeking the position the style of his dress and of his equipages being assiduously copied his income was only about a thousand ayear but he seemed to spend five business over in lady vivians c sanctum sanctorum the earl begins to talk nonsense to his daughter whom he addresses by the soubriquet of 1 witch  so harry is come to look after you vivian it seems will it be an easy conquest t the boys in love with somebody else papa it is easy to see dont you notice how absent and taciturn he is his hearts in the highlands well i should rather like him for a soninlaw goodlooking dont you think  very and clever rather  how laconic we are you dont seem at all smitten witch why papa id as soon marry guy ones my cousin you know and the others my uncle i  flattering to luttrel by jove i

with a roundabout good sense such as lord bacon says should be the prerogative of that sex which jumps to a conclusion without the more tardy process required by man to arrive at the same result and delights in making her father happy joining in his pursuits whether indoor or outdoor manages the  great household of riverdale court to perfection i well as being of assistance to him in  the affirs of his estates while in political matters she gave as much help as philip ii of spain received from the infanta isabella whom on his death bed he called the light of his eyes such a girl would be wooed in her own fashion and one delicious morning as she steers the boat which her father and guy luttrel are rowing she remarks reflectively to the earl and her unclewell if ever i am in love i hope i shall be a little less foolish than the people i have seen in that predicament and then proposals sentiment and stuff why i should laugh at a man who talked blankverse to me  pray how would you have it done witch  asked the earl laughing  how in a plain straightforward way why should a man lose his wits at the most important instant of his life when two people love one another they know it pretty well beforehand so a simple form of words will do perhaps youll suggest the form laughed guy i am an old fogey but a mans never safe from feminine perils till hes under the turf yes and i may want to marry again said lord riverdale fifty is a nice marrying ag well said the young lady laugh at me as muci as you like but i should prefer a simple straightforward way of doing it vivian askiigh will you be my wife is the sort of question i should like to be asked  candid young lady  said luttrel and what kind of an answer would you give   asked the earl  ye8 if i liked the man no if i didnt and if he were unwise enougoh to ask whether he might hope for a change of feeling or any other absurd question i should wish him good morning and cut him dead ever after one more quotation and we have done with the intricacies of  who is the heir  leaving the reader to follow the everchangingg themes with which mr collins delights to amuse his leisure and take up the one bread of interest in the nnovel that of 4baimii1 vivian and her socalled uncle gay lmrel it is a bight december day m or which the fair girl has i i i i rendered abundant to all within her range and now upon the frozen lake as sheflew over the flashing grinding ice guy luttrel suddenly overtook her c an you talk while you skate  he asked 0 yes1 well i want you to answer a single question you taught me yourself the best way to put it w iell  she said  what is it go on how mysterious and diplomatic you are i ifviaii a stleigh will yoit be muy wfe   said guy she looked at him for a moment archly she gave herself a sudden impetus and spun rapidly round on the cracking ice which encircled a little islet then returning towards him she kissed her glove to him and said yes mr guy luttrel i will and with that she skimmed rapidly away towards where the skaters were more numerous  i wonder if anybody else ever made a proposal on the ice said guy to himself vivian said he as they walked towards the court i have an immense number of things to tell you the earl wont object i know though hell probably think me too old but i shall tell him you are the best judge of that but ive a mystery to unfold to you vivian

youre not joking are you now how old is she i shalt love her so youre a good creature vivian thats a fact i shouldnt like to be anybodys stepfather myself so i can appreciate your kindness of heart and now ill go and talk to the earl and have it over before dinnertime if mr amortimer collins would write a nnovel entire without rushing into print before the tale is finished or allow himself to break away from the main thread of his narrative he would no doubt be entitled to rank with the most successful nnovelists of the day as it is  who is the heir is pleasant and agreeable reading i i i

a golden heart a nnovel nev nnovels by tom hood 1 3 vols tinsley brothers some two years have elapsed since mr hood publishedcaptain masterss children and now he puts forth a story which is so far superior to either of his two previous nnovels that we are enabled to congratulate him on a measure of success which as the result of patient and thoughtful preparation for the labour of composition has a moral for those hasty and prolific fabricators of prose fiction who are so eager for fame and riches that they cannot bring themselves to take the steps that are requisite for the attainment of either of them our testimony in favour of  a golden heart must however be given with reserves and qualifications for wrong would be done to the author no less than to many of such persons as are likely to become his readers if we represented that the tale satisfied all the more important requirements of art or was free from flaws and blemishes arising from inadvertence and forgetfulness mr hood has yet to learn how to design a story so that its parts besides being proportionate and harmonious shall seem to have issued from one germ by a process that may bo likened to the growth of trees many of the scenes of the tale do not strike the reader as the necessary or natural consequence of what has gone before but rather as independent pictures for any one of which if it were removed another might be substituted without any loss to though general effect and purpose of the authors work in consequence of this defectiveness of structure on closing the book at though end of the third volume the reader feels as though he had been examining a puzzle of many pieces brought into accurate juxtaposition by mechanical contrivance rather than a work of art in which the multiplicity of the parts should bc altogether put out of sight by the results of their combination moreover some of the separate parts are of inferior workmanship though he is for the most part a skilful and conscientious carpenter mr hood has hung upon hinges some folding doors that are several inches too large for the apertures into which they are meant to fit and occasionally he uses timber that even under the blows of his hammer shows signs of incipient dryrot when at the end of his book he describes his bohemia as peopled by the same persons who breathed its destructive atmosphere at the opening of the tale he is certainly chargeable with forgetfulness as to the length of time covered by his volumes though arrangements of the narrative make it hard to see how the rev augustus eudgeworth who is described as a young man on the occasion of the childrens excursion to epping forest can have worked as a poor curate for fiveandtwenty years before he was appointed to a city living unless smallpox has been very inaccurately described by our medical authorities miss marian carlyle can scarcely have sickened of that malady in the time and way set forth by mr hood concerning the mode by which james trefusis an inventive engineer and the hero of the story was enlightened as to the means by which he ought to rifle his new piece of ordnance we should have entered no protest had not mr hood in his preface defended the incident as reasonable and in accordance with the fitness of things but what would have been no matter worth the trouble of correction had we been permitted to smile at it as a nnovelists notion of mechanical science changes its complexion when the author instead of cancelling the absurd passage gravely maintains that it is a felicitous illustration of natures habit of instructing human intelli gence that janies trefusis may well have learned how to rifle cannon in a new way by observing the conformation of the interior of a little tube taken from a trumpetshaped flower mr hood insists because  in her vast storehouse the principal  of the archimedean screw was at work ere we groped our way to it and because  the bone of the first bird contained the secret of our tubular bridges the strength of material in a hollow circular form unfortunately for mr hoods argument the tubes of tubular bridges do not illustrate in any way the peculiar strength of  hollow circular forms for the simple reason that they are rectangular if mr hood will take a run this autumn to bangor and make proper use of the advantages attached to residence in the george or other hotel of that agreeable city he will be in a better position to judge how far the secret of robert stephensons tubular structures may be said to have existed in the bone of the first bird that warbled in the groves of eden in the mean time he may ascertain from any sound authority on iron bridges that though the engineers first conception of a tubular bridge was formed on the theory that such a bridge should be a fourcornered tube toe did not give it permanent expression until he had satisfied himself by experiment that circular or elliptical formations would fail for his special purpose through want of strength but in spite of such trips as these and others to which we might draw attention the nnovel in which they occur is a wholesome vigorous manly story distinguishable from ordinary books of its kind by the power of its descriptions of character and natural scenery and by a fine vein of humour to its account of james trefusiss intercourse with the authorities of the ordnance office an account that owes some of its pungency to the authors familiarity with the actual working of a government officewe pay a high but deserved compliment when we say that it will endure to be compared as a piece of satiric writing with mr dickenss description of the circumlocution clerks very good also are the pictures of those regions of bohemia in which james trefusis is from time to time a sojourner nor is the story upon the whole without title to the merit of originality as that term is understood when it is applied to the creations and devices of a nnovelist although in respect to some of its leading characters and incidents the narrative bears so strong a resemblance to another work of fiction published five years since that an ungenerous critic would find it easy to establish against mr hood a charge of something near akin to plagiarism in 18c2 messrs chapman  hall published a nnovel  olive blakes good work the interest of which mainly depended on the diverse fortunes of two sisterstho younger a vain frivolous and beautiful girl the elder no less remarkable for a high sense of duty moral courage and womanlinesswho on the death of their grandfather are left dependent on their own exertions and who soon after the loss of the suffolk home in which their childhood was passed find their way to london where the one sinks or appears to sink to the misery and degradation which are likely to be the fate of a girl of great beauty and weak principle in the sinful capital whilst the other by a strenuous discharge of humble duties preserves her life from stain and under cruel circumstances wins the love of all who come within her influence a chief part of the trial and labour of this good woman is found in her endeavour to seek out in order that she may reclaim her from sin the sister who has gone astray and whom she is led to regard as steeped in wickedness eventually the erring girl is recovered and the elder sister becomes the happy wife of an engineer who knew her in girlhood has watched her hard struggle with poverty and sorrow and after years of assiduous wooing eventually takes her as his bride to church from the hospital where she has laboured as a nurse and teacher of sick children this is the nnovel of 1862 and that a golden heart is not without resemblance to it may be seen when we say that mr hoods nnovel principally concerns the fortunes of two such sisters who on the loss of their cornish home in which they have been reared as ladies commence life in london as governessesin which city the vain and lnovely girl through her moral infirmity even more than the wickedness of the world sinks into sin and shame and woe hke those in which her counterpart in the nnovel of 62 falls or is supposed to fall whilst the elder and duteous sister after finding comfort for her woe and victory over adverse fortune in the performance of duty and after seeking for her fallen sister in the haunts of vice eventually marries the engineer james trefusis who knew her in childhood has watched her struggle with poverty and sorrow and after years of assiduous wooing leads her as his bride to church from the schoolhouse in clerkenwell where she has laboured for years j ar as the nurse and teacher of children our pur ta pose in noticing the close resemblance of the i th distinguishing features of these nnovels is not to i a insinuate that mr hood has made an unfair  to use or any use of an earlier writers work  in very likely he never read the nnovel published  s in 18g2 to which we allude and most cer h tainly had he read and remembered it he  01 would have had the prudence to abstain from je treading so closely in the steps of his pre ii cursor some months since to give a timely b lesson to nnovelists overzealous for thc protec  el tion of their works from imaginary plagiarism h we showed how all the leading incidents con  v nected with the pending claim upon the titch fi born baronetcy had been set forth with such i ii minuteness in a nnovel called  not dead yet  n two years before the claimant to that baronetcy j r made his pretensions known that had the 11 nnovel been a statement of actual occurrences  s and the claimants case merely a work of fie q tion few critics would have hesitated to assert that the latter was a literal reproduction of the former in the golden heart we have evidence that a nnovel may be an apparent reproduction of another nnovel just as a legal claim may to all appearance be a simple restatement of a fictitious story since nnovelists are students and painters of the same objects it is in the nature of things that prose fiction should from time to time reproduce itself and we can only wish that its repetitions ot itself were always as pleasant and vigorous and full of distinctive ability as mr hoods capital nnovel,novel
way of revelation there have been many occasions when reading a nnovel we have been aware of the author at his work constructing plot evading difficulties carefully drawing his story to its conclusion there have been fewer occasions when the story has moved like some fine natural process gravely and steadily irresistibly towards its inevitable end the author being a mere accessorya needful recording medium not for many moons and many nnovels have we received this latter impression so strongly as when reading  way of revelation it is a big thing a nnovel of note among the published thousands of ordinary interest it holds a strange reserve of power and tragic emotion its observation and penetration are free from all reproach of smartness or betrayed effort that it should be a  war nnovel  makes its triumph all the more sure while all the more surprising but the battlefields of france and flanders so wonderfully poignantly described are here seen as the playgrounds of elemental forces contending for the souls and bodies of poor human victims of two of those victims principally the story tells bringing them on the stage as young society philanderers apparently useless at a ball in midsummer 1914 and tracing their lives through the years of terror when thousands of such men passed severest tests of moral and physical courage joked in the face of death and heartened others by their example in a story running to more than 500 pages there are of course many characters in none of them can the authors skill be said to falter but in adrian knovle and eric sinclair it is at its highest they are not made greek gods they are simply ordinary fellows falling in love dancing when opportunity comes dabbling in literary matters and sampling the strange exotic fads and coteries of london therefore the live talk act and are not dull rosemary the girl whom adrian loves is a weakling blown upon by every warm wind of fashion and fancy she is not strong enough to resist the enticements of a noxious poet of the erotic type and there is a tense scene when adrian rushing impetuously home on leave hears them in conversation together and receives almost a deathblow he seeks death in fact after this cruel disaster to his ideals but death comes to his chum eric instead and adrian lives wounded in body and spirit to find happiness later with the calm steadfast woman whom eric had loved farther than this vague sketch we shall not follow the plot it has many fine episodes both of war and peace without reserve we can  place air ewarts work among the distinguished the nnovels that matter strong because the personality behind it is strong a living record that will mean much to all who lived and worked and hoped and despaired and lost faith and found it during those five unforgettable years  way of revelation by wilfrid ewart putnam 7s 6d net part of the war scenes in this book originally appeared in the english revew which takes rather a legitimate pride in the full work now expressed in a nnovel ant in the author in one sense it is the most notable work since the armistice for it deals with realities not with artificial situations and potins and may be likened to henri batailles feu of which it is the english counterpart indeed the war scenes are of historical interest so vivid and tense are they so true so actual but the authors object was twofold not only the front the  back  also figures and this part of the book is disagreeable almost painful in its hideous revelation of life in the world of war profiteering here also the author cuts with a razor edge he is young enough not to fear criticism he has written a startling book a thing that will live as a chronicle of the times andhe has not spared the women whom he shows up in their true garb of safe  patriotism the book is so good that the question must involuntarily be asked is the author a new writer or has he written this one thing from the inspiration of emotion from the need of purging his soul of the tragic memories of the war  we advise people to read this quite one of the best of war nnovels so far,novel

rogue herries by hugh walpolc manain ior 6d on of the characters in mr aldous huseys point counter point makes an iluinating distinction between the kind of noelist he himself is mr huxleys own kind and what he calls very prettily the congenital nnovelist  who creates a world of people not with the aim whether monscious or unconscious of illustrating a viw of life but for its own sake he writs if you will for fun though it would probably be more accurate to say dot he writes of necessity in an endeavour to relieve the pressure on his imagination of dte fantasy that haunts him he may be unintellectual and even in a sense unintelligent he may be lamentably deficientas dickens the greatest of them wasin poetic sensibility intellectual curiosity and moral ideas or he may bethough this has nt happened yetas infinite in range as shakespeare himself these endowments re beside the point what distinguishes him from others for the purposes of our definition is that he is the vehicle perhaps eve the victim of an incessant copious creaon now mr hugh walpole is a congenital nvelist his stories his people his world hough they have necessarily a personal clouring from their author bear that unmistkable mark of authenticity the air of king not only spontaneous but selfcreated the story of rogue herries is probably the ricst as well as the longest of mr walpoles nnovels it has movement colour humour and drama it is robust and fullmooded and it has the true flavour of its pjriod which is the eighteenthcentury it tains many scenes that linger in the nmeory the chinese fair where herries dls  by auction his too importunate msress davids assertion of his manhood hn threatened for the last time as it provm with his fathers whip the duel beteen herries and osbaldistone the death of margaret herries who dies in the oldfashioned conversational manner wet movingly the witchbaiting and many ither and smaller things the most and best of these memorable episodes occur in the first of the books four parts mr walpole is perhaps at his best in a scene of bustling good cheer such as the christmas feast at  statesman peels  it was a scene of brilliant colour with the blazing fire the red berries of the holly glowing in every corner old johnny shoestring in bright blue breeches and with silver buckles to his shoes perched on a high stool fiddling for his life the brass gleaming faces shining the stamp of the shoon the screaming of the fiddle the clapclap of the hands as the turns were made in the danceand beyond the heat and the light the dark form of the valley lying in breathless stillness its face stroked by the fall of lingering reluctant snow mr walpole has indeed all the gifts of the born nnovelist he has also some of the faults that are commonly found in a too facile writer perhaps it is mere idiosyncrasy on my part that makes me impatient with his frequent lapses into short and scrappy paragraphs perhaps i am wrong in thinking that it is a storytellers business to coordinate his information before presenting it to the reader and that he should not rely too much on the bellmans maxim  what i tell you three times is true mr walpole can write when he chooses as well as the next man and often a great deal better his prose is sensitive as well as vigorous and his vision is acute as well as tolerant but above all his fertility in the creation of characters the prime business of your congenital nnovelist and the skill with which he sets them moving together must be the despair of many a more painstaking writer yet there is something lacking here is a long book romantic copiously eventful full of life but one rises from it without that sense of a profound and satisfying experience which great fiction induces it is as if the author had taken with both hands what comes to him so easily scattered it over his page and never troubled to demand of himself that last degree of concentration that makes all the differenc for this reason or for another it lu intimacy in davids flight with sa for example the dramatic tension of a admirable if conventional situation is destroyed by a kind of chattiness the autho breaking in to tell us that on this very spot in a later century a descendant of these two lovers would conduct quite another sort of wooing elsewhere he adopts too often the tiresome device of telling us that soandso was  always to remember  this or that these things serve only to destroy the illusion by reminding us that we are reading a st they release us from the persuasion that we are sharing an immediate present experience the life of herrics begins for us at thirty and ends half a century later he is shown as an implacable dreamer tormented by a vision of perfection that is symbolised for him in the fantasy of a white horse of incomparable beauty swim ming a lake and climbing a hillside to triumph disappointed in his quest for this ultimate harmony the mystic consummation of all desire he lives wilfully shut away in himself and those who know him only by his outward conduct judge him a rogue and worse suffering from a kind of frustrated nobility he is often cruel ad arrogant and always lonely he loves no one but his son david until in his middle forties he chances upon a young girl called mirabell in whom he at once recognises his hearts desire unfortunately i find it next to impossible to believe in this youg woman or in herries love for her for me she is a figment of pure romantic fancy an apparition the projection of a dream and the authors persuasion dta she is as good flesh and blood as the mg of his people casts a shadow of unrealiy over the latter part of a delightful ad heartwarming and yet exasperating boo i gelw bullm  mew ltnovels rogue herries mr hugh walpoles new nnovel  rogue herries is set in the eighteenth century and is a remarkable study of a man francis herries is a rogue a waster a libertine and yet a gentleman such a man as has been dear to a hundred and one women nnovelists but no woman nnovelist could have drawn this man so convincingly so accurately with such masterly and artistic detachment with so clear an insight into his muddied and struggling spirituality i do not know whether it is mnr walpoles masterpiece perhaps i am not far enough from its first reading to judge properly as to that but i do not think it will ever rank among his lesser achievements it seems to me to be a major booknot only for mr walpole but for any writer it is more too than the stuii of a man it is the study of a family of a period of a whole district of england its setting the lake country is quite as important as its events and the coloured spaciousness of his descriptions has a value that is subtly dramatic perhaps more dramatic in essence than many of the apparently more dramatic moments in the plot mr walpole does not write like a poethe is too accomplished a technician to write sentences that might be mistaken for  poetic prose  vet there is something of a poetic sweep of a poetic creativeness about this long mellow and wholly coherent book from the first moment when we see herries in the inn at keswick we are conscious of the truth of his presentation as a psychological study the man is alive from his first entrance and mr walpole has a felicitous power of making his characters betray themselves in their insignificant actions as much as in their larger it is by our trivialities that we are known and the cumulative effect of a characters trivialities is the real triumph in his creation herriess wearing of his rich clothes to meet his pompous brother is a revelation all the more sure because it is not thrust at us but insinuated to us without undue comment at the moment and without analysis beyond its own open fact yet how significant it is of the rebel  the book as well as being a fulllength portrait of one man is a whole gallery of portraits some of them sketches of people in a particular moment others of people growing developing and reacting through a whole series of moments it is impossible in a reviews short space to give a proper idea of the variety of men and women who are painted in this book the whole herries family seems to be living before us when certain members of it are entirely in the background we are yet conscious that they are still living and going about their daily rounds somewhere outside the book covers and we wait for this or that member to reappear produce his or her reactions and show the family characteristics coming out with almost the sureness of fate perhaps the family was to the herries fate there are many studies of child life and these are as profound as they are exquisite the study of the son of e  rogue herries by hlugh walpole ios 6d macmillan mr iugh walpole osing for his bust to mr david evans rbs rogue herries david is as masterly as that of the father yet a little less interesting because he was himself a little less interesting but we are able to watch the father and the son diverging and yet never separating we can appreciate the antagonism in temper which never becomes an antagonism in appreciation both are men rarely has the almost feminine jealousy of a father been more finely described than in the chapter entitled  the seafather and son the emotion is so masculine there is sentiment but no sentimentality and at the back of it there is something so virily wilful both are menfor indeed it is at that moment that the young herries comes into his manhood the women are no less admirable the wife of herries so truly feminine in her lack of intuition rather than in her possession of it the daughter deborah subtle in her very subduedness and most of all mirabell starr there is a touch of goethes mignon in mirabell she has not the poetry of mignon but she has something of her peculiar apartness as if she were a being not perhaps of some other world but of some other manner of inner life it is not often that characterisations so primitively simple are so symbolical too i find looking back on the book that nearly all my impressions of it are either of the people in it or of the country in which it is set and i wonder whether that was mr walpoles intention scenes of drama and outside event in the book are neither few nor far between yet it is the people i remember first and the happenings afterwards but as i think again certain chapters do leap out with intensities of their own the death of the wife of herries the funeral of greataunt mariawith its extraordinary little study of the dog the pitiful drowning of mrs wilson the witch these undoubtedly are at the very height of modern fiction and i am far more tempted into byways of appreciation than along the high road of direct criticism if i may be allowed to remember that i am supposed to be  reviewing  this book i will venture one point of criticism though i feel ungrateful in doing so there is little humour but there is a wealth of quiet irony mr walpole does not repeat himself and this period nnovelthe fortyfive occurs in the middle of ithas a genuine freshness of inspiration at the same time its psychological wisdom is too penetrative and true for it to have the false freshness of romance it is a serious study of life a mature studv and a work of art wallace b nichols,novel

orthodox and loyal parson geoffrey turnstile esq a timeserving sycophant parasite to lord slender and sir pertinax pennyfarthing a baronet of taste and vertif who likes flattery and himself and next to his own portrait loves the ladies we have two country elections some scores of speeches a trial for sedition various tftetdtes a duel two or three lovescenes two or three sermons two or three situations of sentiment and no less than halfadozen marriages to wind up but it is time to allow our readers to judge of the style in which the three volumes are written we pass over the election and several passable touches of humour to extract a narrative of citizen norths journey when endeavouring to evade the pursuit of the officer sent after him on a charge of high treason our author is fond of comparisons and the following with which he opens the 15th chapter is perhaps worth perusingas we leave mfiss north in very good company and in perfect safety we trust our readers notwithstanding their gallantry and the superior interest which they take in the fair sex will not reluctantly attend us in pursuing the course of the patriot for on the fate of patriots what great events depend and on their destiny what momentous concerns do hang  we have always thought it a great defect or rather redundancy in mr addisons tragedy of cato that hie diverts our attention fromn the patriot to entertain us with a lovetale and a scene or two of touching tenderness and somehow or other it so halplpens that this tenderness is not very touchingr and the whole play grows grievously flat although  the virtuous marcia towers above her sex the plain fact is that our symipathy with a lying patriot is so different from our sympathy with a lovesick swain or a sentimental damsel that the emotions are mutually destructive of each other so then although mnr addison has depicted both emotions with such exquisite pathos and so very unartificially inasmuch as that one is by itself enough to break our hearts yet when they both come together in one short drama they destroy the effect they would have produced singly and those matters which would have made two very tolching plavs now make one whiich is untouching wid intouclwd far ho1wever very far be it from our thoughts or wishes to insinuate by these expressions that it is our intention to leave miss north totally unprovided with any means or materials of sympathy and tenderness we are not writing a drama which must be grasped by one eftort of mind but a narrative through vwhich the reader may advance witl consideration and coolness but wve are cauti ous of so arranging its parts as that the pathos of sentiment should unduly iiiteiicre with the emotions of patriotism our patriot too is superior to cato for the rtomran only died for his country and then he could be of no farther usc but mr north took care to live for his country and wvas very much at ier service whlen needed so that this superiority in the patriots character can spare room for a little leaven of tenderness and love and after all what if the patriot hjimnself should be affected with the tender passion it is not impossible by the way what a pity it is that mr addison did not make cato himnself fall in love that wvould have increased the interest of his play very considerably but to proceed at two oclock p m m1r north alias mr west took his

now not easily heard on account of the increased noise of the coach from its more rapid progress he perceived that he had possession not of the paper which had graced his own breakfasttable but of a second edition of a ministerial or government paper in which was a lescription and a rewvard offered for the apprehension of stephen barddolph northl now it did appear quite supeif11uous to read aloud to his company a description of a person whom they had before theem hiolding therefore his head and the paper nearer to the window as if for the purpose of gaiing more lit lhe very cleverly contrived

fallen mr north had nothincg to do but to apologize and the merchant had nothing to do but to accet his apologies and to beg that no more might be said about it for i believe continued he  that i you

nnovelists license and invested them with those delicate hues of poetrv which are necessary to lignify them to our fancies and to give them an interest that of themselves they do not commnanl hence it is not imlrolable that some fastidious realers may exclaim against the familiarity of many of the lialogues and object to the expressions lut into the inouths of the speakers as occasionally coarse and vulgar the answer of mr ii ril es wvould be that they are the very language of such personages as lie has introduced  that thley are true to cliaracter that such men always so converse in society thus far this defence is valid  to what extent an author is bound to dress up his lialogucs in a shape lifferent from that which they vwould have worn in fact whether it is allowved to nnovelists

wylders hand wywers hand is a remarkable work to the genuine lovers of fiction who are influenced less by names than by works it will be emirently attractive it may be said to be from beginning to end a mass of mysteriessome of a natural or ordinary kind growing out of the development of character and the pro of the story others of a supernatural order weird legendary at times ghastly there are no less than three or four families al more or less connected whose doings with each other form the skeleton of this storythe wylders lakes and brandons and another branch ennobled the chelfords all as

certain unexpected deaths and by the legal effect of testamentary contingencies elevated into the condition of a large landed proprietor the estates of his cousin dorcas brandon the heiress of the brandon property adjoin his own and at the very prudent sulggrestion of the dowager lady chelford a marriage but confessedly one of convenienceis arrangled between mlark and dorcas the socalled lovers or the affianced couple are it is true civil and kind to each other exchanging presents and the ordinary tokens of affection under such circumstances but in truth the ladxy has given her heart to her other cousin stanley lake whose sister rachel is oddly enough and secretly the oblject of mlarks admiration and not of his alone but also of lord helfords mark is of rather a rough coarse impulsive nature and having gone through many troubles and privations in early life by sea and land is not remarkable for delicacy in speech or refinement in habits of life dorcas is cold haughty apathetic of firin will when once resolved but kind and deeply atfectionate towards rachel a girl of an independent cast of mind hightoned and of unswerving principles of rectitude in this respect a contrast to her brother stanley who having been a spoiled and petted child has grown up a somewhat idle wild dissipated youth and having sold out of the army isat present apparently without an object in life he is aware however of aliss brandons feelings towards himself and although miark and he were never on very friendly terms and notwithstanding the impending marriage he pays a visit to his sister and the endgaged couple and converses with all ostensibly at ease and without prejudice against any but being a plotter and schemer by instinct lays his plans accordingly mark wylder is suddenly called away about ten days before the wedding on a trifling business to london  and though letters are immediately afterwards received from day to day both by his lawyer and by lake at first excusing himself for his unexpected stay next postponing the marriage and on a further occasion releasing dorcas from the engagemient giviing lake power to act for him in pecuniary matters and so forth no really satisfactory reason is assigned for his longcontinued absence lrumours reach the car of his solicitor of a former clandestine marriaae of a dishonourable transaction at cards which necessitates his temporary absence and of other matters supposed to be possibly productive of the same result but still letters frequently though at irregular periods come to hand relating to the management of his property and even one curtly expressing his acquiescence in the contemplated union between stanley and dorcas which is it may be added finally celebrated to the great discomfiture of lady chelfords projects in the meantime rachels life which was once all tranquillity and happines8 has become overclouded with fears anxieties miseries conversations2 dark and only half intelligible and fragmentary scenes of a paifully mysterious character take place between her and her brother she becomes estranged from dorcas and both from stanley the only being whom either had ever loved the unhappy wife being now made aware that some strange and important secret eiists between brother and sister of which she is not permitted to partake the rev w wylder marks brother and his affairs at this juncture of the story proceed to occupy the work in considerable force and contribute not a little to the general ule while his honourable and affectionate nature imposed on at a sides the simplicity of his wife dolly and the pathetic circu stances in which their only treasure little  fairy is presented to the reader are felt as a relief to the complicated rascalities of other characters both within and without the circle of this sijgulu  i3 ii famnily the sanctimonious lawyer larkns cautiofs ana   fully executed attempts to keep iin favour both with wylder and lake his selfinterested endeavours to elucidate the mystesy of marks disappearance which defies his efforts and his extreme solicitude to ruin the poor rector and obtain a slice of the brandon property we cannot without disclosing the final issue of his varoli schemes which would be imprudent give any more in detail it is sufficient to add that the work is not of an ordinary character thi story is well conceived powerfully sustained and thoroughly wrlout up not only in its main features but its minor accewsories  wylder8 hand a nnovel by joseph sheridan le fanu 3 vols bentleywylders hand by the author of  the house by the churchyard is a great improvement on that nnovel it fulfils the promise which it gave and avoids most of the faults wylders hand is a clever story the reader will be carried on by too strong an interest to have time to pause for criticism when the book is closed and ho has time to consider he may perhaps object to some of the details but the fact will remain that the nnovel is one of sterling interest it is well put together and the mystery is very cleverly kept up the reader is just sufficiently taken into the confidence of the author to be able to feel a strong sympathy with though personages concerned whilst at the same time there is sufficient concealment to stimulate curiosity and on the whole the dcnomcnt is adequate to though preparation  we say on the whole because the final iii seo very of the cause of mark wylders mysterious disappearance is not sufficiently marked our readers would scarcely thank us to tell them the whole story but we will keep the authors secret ind give the outline of the tale the scene is laid in a line old manorial countryhouse in a midland county the scenes are all well described the short preliminary sketch of the two families the wylders and the brandons is an excellent introduction to a dark and shadowy story there were wylders of brandon and brandons of brandon in one generation a wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the brandons the next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto the estates were back again with the wylders a statement of title is usually a dry affair but that of the dynasty of brandon hall was a truculent romance this strong bad handsome halfinsane halfdiabolical race who must have descended in aright line from cain or the corsair are represented at the period when the story begins by dorcas brandon the proud beautiful apathetic heiress of the manorhouse who seems to suffer for the sins of her forefathers rather than to partake of their evil nature there is a complicated coubinship of all the chief parties the wylders whose estates join those of brandon and whose people were every bit os wicked are about to be joined together in matrimonythe estates and the owners mark wylder a rough dark evilomened seacaptain who does not belie his blood having just succeeded to the wylder estates is on the point of marriage with his cousin dorcas he would greatly prefer his poor cousin rachel lake who lives in a lonely picturesque farmhouse called redmans dell whilst dorcas prefersbut that is one of thc secrets well there is a sinister but very elegant capt stanley lake rachels brotherone of the brandon and wylder cousins the father bas committed suicide after spending all his fortune and the son is an idler scamp and coxcomb of one of her majestys regiments of guards with nothing to recommend him to mercya dark scheming plotting head and a cold heart with a talent for telling lies and forging letters which ought to have brought him to the gallows if it had not made his fortune he tyrannises over his sister who is the only character quite free from the evil taint that runs in the three families she is however a victim to it there is some secret of rascality between stanley lake and mark wyldera secret which apparently makes mark dread his cousin as well as detest him they go out together one night though week before the marriage and mark wylder never returns letters are received from him speaking mysteriously of his affairs and of some old scrape the consequences of which have obliged him to go suddenly abroad he sets his betrothed bride free from her engagement and letters on business continue to be received written by him from different continental towns giving directions about his property and speaking of his return the lawyer to whom his letters are chiefly addressed has a great deal to do in the story but his part is far too longall his chicaneries and attempts to overreach poor william wylder marks brother are wearisome and occupy the space needed for the dinohment some time after the departure of mark wylder dorcas brandon marries stanley lake the reader has been prepared for this exchangetho reader knows what a scoundrel he is without heart or conscience but dorcas brandon does not know it she is infatuated about him had determined to renounce her engagement to mark if mark himself had not saved her the trouble but stanley lake has difficulties and mysteries of his own in which he has involved his sister rachel and a dark terrible mystery gathers over the whole house of brandon there aro some touches of imagination which though they have nothing absolutely to do with the story heighten the interest and are extremely effective tamar the old nurse and though spectral figure of uncle lorn are powerful sketches though descriptions of places too are so well managed that rocks trees pathways ami even the very furniture of certain rooms add to the weird ghostly awe inspired by the dark nameless crime that haunts the story gradually gathering distinctness and becoming palpable until in the end it stands revealed and confessed as we have said the dinohmcnt is not sufficiently worked out but it has substance enough to justify though preparation mr le fanu shows qualities that ought to enable him to write even better nnovels than the present his style is forcible and brilliant and his faculty for graphic description sometimes leads him to bestow too much time and minute delineation on secondary characters lawyer larkins and his rascalities are followed at far too great a length  the reader does not caro to be diverted from the main stream of the interest but  wylders hand is a remarkable story ami we recommend our readers to get it for themselves,novel
