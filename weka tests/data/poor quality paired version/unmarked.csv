literature the writings of john greenleaf whittier 7 vols macmillan  co this edition of the works of mr whittier is intended at least as to the poems to be complete unless so far as there are hopes that the time  honoured author whose  brown dwarf of eugen  and  one of the signers date only from last year may add some postscripts of pleasant verse to the collection which now contains he says  all that i care to republish and some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself i should have omitted at the request of his publishers mr whittier has in this edition allowed the reappearance though only in an appendix of early poems which for many years he has banished as not worthy of his nameand as to which indeed it is not possible to say that his name will restore them to the favour with which they were received by american readers of sixty years ago when as he apologetically remarks  the standard of criticism was not discouragingly high the publishers object in persuading mr whittier to republish the things that he would rather not have written was  to make the edition so complete and retrospective that students of the poets career will always find the most abundant materials for their purpose and if we are to suppose that mr whittiers readers read not for the sake of his poetry but to give themselves a course of educational study on his career as a poet the appendix may certainly be useful to them tor the excess of juvenile efflorescence and the protraction of its period in mr whittiers case as contrasted with the fact of his nevertheless coming to a fruitage time are shown by the poems in this appendix and their dates to be exceptional and though the phenomenon is easily explainable by the cause mr whittier assigns for the popularity of his verse in its turgid immaturity it offers something for the student of the career to study if he will take the trouble to compare with mr whittiers literary infancy the literary infancies of other writers who earlier or as late as he like him eventually arrived at literary years of discretion but even from this point of view it is difficult to see any sufficient advantage gained to the world by overruling mr whittiers wisely critical judgement of his least meritorious productions the arrangement has however given him the opportunity of dismissing the tedious and unreal attempt in the school of scott  mogg megone which disfigured his former collected editions to the limbo of the appendix and thus increasing the honour to which his riper work entitles him from all critics who appreciate artistic unaffectedness and the grace of sobriety the poems of mr whittiers literary prime vary much in quality but all have at least the strength of manly common sense good taste and direct expression while many possess also either reticent and therefore effective pathos or a certain eager and orderly rush rather perhaps of orator than of poet but instinct with metrical vigour which has characterised some of his most popular pieces his boundaries have not been wide but within them he has been master he has been sure of his purpose and what he purposed he could effect and he has shown an understanding of his limits which is in itself a faculty of no mean order in england his poetry taking it all in all has not met with the wide and somewhat undiscriminating acceptance it has received from his own countrymen and only a few pieces can be named as having become favourites of our general public but we may fairly say that the restriction of the welcome on this side the water is quite as undiscriminating as its liberality on the other side for instance now that every one knows  maud muller why are there comparatively few who are familiar with  telling the bees  an idyl so tenderly and touchingly simple that we mean presently to quote it in fullwith  st martins summer with  mabel martin with  the new wife and the old  the suitability of  barbara frietchie and  skipper iresons bide for the semihistrionic recitations now in vogue has made them indeed but too much with us  for it is a dull thing to tire and as we now say to jade any thing too far  but why does no one

council with their bibles round the board answering englands royal missive with a firm thus saith the lord bise again for home and freedom  set the battle in array  what the fathers did of old time wc their sons must do today tell us not of banks and tariffs cease your paltry pedler cries shall the good state sink her honour that your gambling stocks may rise  would ye barter man for cotton  that

dumb in her despair  has she none to break the silence 1 has she none to do and dare  o my god  for one right worthy to lift up her rusted shield and to plant again the pinetree in her banners tattered field  this is a fine piece of passionate rhetoric and has real fire in it still mr whittiers antislavery poems do not show him at his best as a poet indeed nobodys antislavery poems ever have been truly poems though some rare few have like  the pine  tree been very good metrical speeches the theme would seem on first thoughts just what must have made any man whose heart was hot about it and who could put feelings into verse at all capable of true poetry for that if for nothing else and must have inspired any true poet with dramatic force and lyric passion to make his least words on it immortal but second thoughts explain why the fact has been so much the reverse antislavery was not a theme for a poet it was too abstract too political and above all too argumentative a great poet might with one short drama one lyric one stanza nay one line about some slave who never existed but in his mind and his readers minds have found his way to human hearts then and for all hereafter as long as the english language lasts but there were in the antislavery agitation no poets who could or would write their poems on the slaves side so the antislavery poets were absorbed in the great public question with all its disputatious details they were in the thick of debates and arguments they wrote them with thought of their opponentsto answer to persuade or to attack poems so written may have their influence in a great public controversy but the controversy over their life is gone they are like weapons of an ancient warfareweapons we respect in the museums but that have no purpose in them for our days mrs beecher stowe in her own line of art managed better she used sympathies of human nature that belonged to all times and peoples and produced a novel which was genuinely a novel with the novels power to absorb attention to amuse and to move and which whatever its faults has lost nothing of that power by reason of the slavery question having become obsolete to her the theme does seem to have given inspiration beyond her normal faculty so that this one book of hers her worst as to some glaring bad qualities has in it a something amounting to genius which her other works can by no means parallel her imagination seems to have been aroused by her zeal while the zeal of the poets whirled their imaginations away and left it the only difference between their polemical productions and those of other able rhetoricians that theirs were in verse and had more similes in them much the same has always been the case with poets polemics weean call to mind no verse directly dealing with aay question agitating the public mind catting for any wrong to be righted urging any great measure which has had it in it to aurvive as poetry the success of its cause except mrs brownings  song of the children and that the  song of the children though intended polemically not only had aa influence on the public mind at the time bat stands forth a poem is because mrs browning with the high poets sympathetic instinct went at once forth from herself aad let her pleadings and her reasonings pass into the piteous simplicity of the thoughts and words of the childrenjust as she would have done in fact had their miseries belonged to ancient history or to an imaginary world to take mr whittier at his best as distinctively a poet we must go to his  poems of nature poems subjective and reminiscent and  narrative and legendary poems as is inevitable when a writer tries to classify his collected poems the series overlap and a piece that stands in one series might as fitly or more fitly stand in another  and it is the merit of the beet poems in these three series that they might all lay claim from one point of view or another to belong to the poems of nature  telling the bees  in the  narrative and legendary poems owes its charm to this and its tender implication and tu4 narration of the simple love and simple sorrow here is the place  right over the hill buna the path i took  vou can see the gap in the old wall still and the steppingstones in the shallow brook there is the house with the gate redbarred and the poplars tall and though barns brown length and tin cattleyard and the white horns tossing above the wall there are the beehives ranged in the un  and down by the brink of the brook are her poor flowers wool oerrun pansy and daffodil rose and pink a year has gone as thc tortoise goes heavy and slow and the same rose bio a and the same sun glows and the same brook sings of a year ago lheres the same sweet cloversmell in the breeze  and the jane sun warm tangles his wings of fire in the trees setting as then over fernside farm  mind me how with a lovers care from my sunday coat 1 brushed off the burrs and smoothed my hair and cooled at the brookside my brow and throat since we parted a month had passed to love a year down through the beeches i looked at last on the little red gate and the well sweep near i can see it all nowthe slantwise rain ol light through the leaves the sundowns blaze on her windowpane the bloom of her roses under the eaves just the same as a month before the house and the trees the barns brown gable the vine by the door nothing changed but the hives of bees before them under the garden wall forward and back went drearily singirg the choregirl small draping each hive with a shred of black trembling i listened the summer sun had the ohill of snow  for i knew she was telling the bees of one oone on the journey we all must go  then i said to myself my mary weeps for the dead today haply her blind old grandsire sleeps the fret and the pain of his age away but her dog whined low on the doorway ill with his cane to his chin the old man sat and the choregirl still sung to the bees stealing out and in and the song she was singing ever since in my ear sounds on stay at home pretty bees fly not hence  mistress mary is dead and gone   in the  personal and occasional series  which with the appendix fill the fourth poetical volume is a set of poems which has only been got into group and made  occasional  by means of a prologue and some tags of conversation at the end of the pieces describing them as having been read aloud by the poet to his companions ina tent on the beach  the collective name of the setthe companions being we are told  fields thelettered magnate and taylor the free cosmopolite declining to accept these oems the wreck of rivermouth the taids of attitash  kallundborg church  the worship of nature and suchas personal and occasional we confine our remarks to the pieces that rightfully belong to these headings when we say that this kind of verse is not so favourably appreciated in england as it appears to be iu the united states possibly all our poets too in their private life write verse to each other but if so they except in one or two exceptional instances do not publish it and they are not often called on for odes and hymns at  celebrations  and openings and anniversariesand so much the better the critic always feels regret when he finds the abilities of men with real gifts frittered away upon these politenesses of the prose there is no need to say much it does not compel blame it does not invite praise margaret smiths journal the editor tells his readers presents a tolerably lifelike picture of the past  unfortunately it does not the shorter tales also show that mr whittier has not that gift of vividness of making even transparent unreality seem true till the moment the reader leaves off reading which is specially the novelists the papers in the two other volumes are on  the conflict with slavery on politics and reforms on literary and historic subjects or are brief biographies of men and of books and tributes to contemporariesall of them manifestly contributions to periodical literature they have of course spirit and purpose we marked from one paper only at least a dozen passages quite amazing for inflation mixed metaphor and bad taste passing to another paper we found not one florid sentence the prose works are not dated but the difference in style must be a matter of dates and it may be reasonably inferred that the florid papers belong to the immature period and the better ones be taken as the true standard of mr whittiers prose,unmarked

  kir mad by baronew von hutten hutchinson  co a sudsm wants a rather long memor to  carry forward  people from one novel and one generation to another the author asks us to make the effort we dimly recall a certain tommy an eater of breadandjam and between whiles the utterer of quint childish remarks he has now developed into lord kingsmead the whimsical undersized hero of the present story his principal reason for existence is seemingly to be the good genius of a newly enriched family who have bought his ancestral hearth this family with the exception of the daughter who is more individual is treated rather conventionally and not very amusingly the humours of the old husband and wife and their language are forced and spasmodic but again some individuality is shown of an uncomfortable kind in an enigmatical lady we were like the hero taken in by her this youth is almost too sentinmental and at the same time too playful and managing at twentythree he tries his prentice hand at matchmaking the goodnatured plotting and repartee between him and the fat duchess he enlists in his service she too came out of another story are not quite good enough for the purpose which appears to be a display of vivacity,unmarked
vittoria victrix by w e norris con stable  co mr norrs like the sculptor in his novel maintains a certain level of achievement he is not a literary rodin but a sound technical craftsman and it may be conjectured will leave work historically valuable for its portrayal of society he is no more exciting than jane austen or trollope but he has more than a scintilla of their photographic gift in the present case the gracious vittoria herself with the amiability perhaps italian which makes her apt to meet kindness halfway the commonplace but clean and honest young nobleman and the equally honest but shrewd american who is the general dissolver of knots and resolver of puzzles are as lifelike as their atmosphere is unromantic vittorias valetudinarian father and his unconsciously selfish sister are also true types of their class and time  vittoria victrix by w e norris constable and co 6s it speaks well for the strength of will of mr norris that he could endure the task of living with the characters of this book for the length of time it took him to write of them but there is no need for one who reads for pleasure to endure the discomfort of the company of vittoria victrix this name was given under circumstances that do not matter to a young girl named vittoria torrance she is the daughter of an english gentleman of considerable estate who never sees her if he can avoid it and of an italian lady about whom the less said the better the hero if there be one is a young man named edwin tratham who is thirtyone years old an ra and a sculptor of world fame if one can get hold of that idea and come to like it there is of course just the chance that one might read on with interest but when on page 4 we read that he as  at the top of the tree  and on page 10 that he was thirtyone we became somewhat incredulous he loves vittoria and in the end marries her but not before some complications crop up in the shape of the heir of an earl and an american millionaire however we left them together at last and are more than content to part with them for good if mr norris were capable of nothing better than this we could bear with it at least with pity but as it is we feel the annoyance of those who look to him for better things there is not a single strong human situation in the book from the first page to the last and only one live character at all the old aunt and she only appears about six times and then in a quite unimportant way we can promise those of our readers who take up  vittoria victrix  at least two hours of genuine boredom,unmarked

terence mcgowan the irish tenant by g l tottenham smith elder and co the irish question has been done in conventional prose ad nauseam as we noted a few weeks since it has not escaped a record in romantic poetry and here we have it in the form of fanciful fiction we can fancy the halfcontemptuous impatient gesture with which most novel readers would throw this book aside on the mere perusal of its title the author too seems to have had some misgivings as to the reception of his work for he has written a halfapologetic preface to it in which he says notwithstanding its suspicious title i feel myself at liberty i think to assert that this book is not a pamphlet in disguise i am rather presumptuous enough to hope that if any one will read it and if it is as truthful a representation as i believe it to be of existing social relations in ireland it may act in some measure as a corrective of a good deal of that literature for which mr gladstone recently returned thanks and dispel perhaps a few of those erroneous impressions regarding ireland which have been sown broadcast through the kingdom of late by casual and special tourists in the country after this handsome explanation and apology we forgave mr tottenhams audacity in mixing irish politics with light literature and proceeded to read his novel which we may as well say at once we found pleasant and interesting reading the cloven foot peeps out occasionally in rather longwinded discussions of party views between a rigid conservative dowager lady eleanor rochfort and a tory of a somewhat milder type lord shirley which are made the media for talking at if not directly talking of certain great politicians of though present day but this aside there is genuine romance in the story none the less interesting because we have too much reason to assume its foundation in stern fact moreover the picturesque descriptions with which the book abounds and the light genial almost brilliant style in which it is written would go far to make even a heavier mixture of the land question palatable the story is one which has had in times past and possibly has now its counterpart in many districts in ireland that of a kind careless and indulfent landlord idolised by his tenantry who regard im with almost patriarchal veneration he dies and the property heavily encumbered finds a new landlord with different ways to his predecessor rents are raised tenants evicted farms joined the old landmarks removed murderous passions evoked by mercenary greed till the once smiling if not perfect landscape is clouded and bloody with agrarian crime when the tale opens allan rochfort is the proprietor of geraldscourt which his family has held since the founder sir gerald rochfort a distinguished soldier in the reign of elizabeth concerning this gentleman we are told  cromwells celtic remnant had their strongholds in the mountains immediately around and made him continually aware of their existence in many bold and ingenious ways his cattle were houghed and carried off his retainers were murdered he was besieged himself in his own castle and it was a very odd thing if he ever had a crop to his name they were extremely pleasant neighbours these exasperated celts who knew that no one would be foolhardy enough to follow them into their own domains and therefore played off their little amenities upon country gen tiemeuwhom they con sidered as intruders with much the same impunity as they are humanely permitted to enjoy at the present day gradually however the kind treatment of those immediately around the invaders residence began to make itself felt in widening ripples  and as the years passed on and the indifference of long habit began to render the peasantry more acquiescent in the appropriation of their property a more conciliatory demeanour came to be adopted an attachment sprang up between the lord of the soil and his unwilling dependents and the oppressor by degrees became looked upon aa a benefactor successive generations fostered the growing feeling and mutual goodwill and kindness slowly broadened down from precedent to precedent until it reached the enthusiastic devotion which the tenantry of the geraldsoourt estate felt now for allan rochfort their present landlord geraldscourt is mortgaged to the last shilling it will bear and its indolent and thoughtless owner troubles himself as little as possible regarding its j future his tenants pay him as they like and aa j they can his boy that should have been his leir is dead and allan feels less interest in though he truly loves a beautiful girl that calls him father phelim mcgowan and his wife tenants on the geraldscourt estate are thanks to the industry of their elder son terence tolerably well off the younger larry is however a goodnatured idle graceless dog who has married and settled in a cabin on a strip of his fathers land as a specimen of the authors humour we quote a description of this latter gentlemans wardrobe your ordinary pauper or beggar has no sentiment of attachment to his rags and allows them to drop off by degrees until he is obliged to beg borrow or steal to replace them the irishman on the contrary understands the philosophy of clothes and furnishes in his nether garments a curious and interesting illustration of the constaut change which is always going on around us in the natural world every seven yean we are told owing to the continual discharge of old particles from our bodies and the constant accretion of new ones we get an entirely new body similarly at certain intervals determined by no fixed law the irishman will be found to change his clothes owing to the continual absorption into their system of black brown blue or grey patches and the gradual discharge of the original foundation so it was with larrythough how many phases he had already passed through or whether the black cloth the yellow corduroy the prey stuff or the brown nondescript which each had their due shane of representation was the elemental matter from which wa garments had originally proceeded is a luoretiaii difficulty which may best be commended to the notice of mr cany or any other

ohara the fostersister of nora the squires daughter he of course has a riyal in a crafty and welltodo tenant on an adjoining estate and the feud between these two furnishes some excellent passages here and there throughout the first volume the representation of the county in which geraldscourt is situated has long been held in the conservative interest by the hountstewart family lord shirley the eldest son however now finds that the priests are preparing an opposition candidate in the person of a radical mr brady a pettifogging rascal and a lawyer to boot shirley comes to canvas the

at last the storm bursts in a manner better told in the graphic sentences of the writer it is rent day and the scene discloses mr majoribanks sitting in state to receive his dues  i for a time all went on smoothly enough  the leaseholders and what few had had no increase to pay seemed to have been put forward first then there was a movement at the lower end of the room succeeded by an expectant silence as a doggedlooking fellow comes forward fumbling in his pocket for his moneybag this was one whose rent had been raised as the landlord knew when he heard his name  and he felt that the storm was about to break there was a significance in the mans manner which was not to be mistaken  and the hushed stillness behind him and the increased crowd of heads at the doorway were in themselves sufficient sign that something of exceptional interest was taking place he waa a tomi time getting ont his money and the delay was rather trying at length after deliberately counting over what be

of vivid reality about its circumstances that invest its unpretentious two volumes with an interest superior to that often excited by larger and more elaborate works of fiction we congratulate mr tottenham on his novel it is not as he says  a pamphlet in disguise  but we defy any reader of intelligence and feeling not to feel the force of the illustrations of irish life and character here presented and their application to s the political events of the present day such a statement a true one of irish affairs cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on english minds and viewed i only in its principal and widest sense as a novel terence mcgowan has merits of a very high order,unmarked

the eye witness and his evidence about many wonderful i things by charles allston collins low bou anli co there is a rare charm of fresh lightheartedness in these essays which most people have already read and liked upon their first appearance in all the year round they represent certain quaint aspects of english society with perfect truth and with an unforced whimsicality of suggestion that differs greatly from the laboured fun of the hack comic journalist while seeming to have been in some degree suggested by it the satire is so goodhumoured the little touches of exaggeration all arc so spontaneous in their gaiety and the comment whether jest or earnest is so free from all vulgarity of taste that the reader never wearies of his gossips company them is an individuality too in the book light as it is and imitative as it is in some respects that promises much for the future success of the writer as an average example of his skill in fair and genial caricature we may qnote mr charles

amateur a little bard yet this is nothing to what is before him when he once gets the wine to his lips it is thenit is at the moment of raising his wineglass to his mouththat the taster is to commence

sipping it this is on the contrary a cours strongly to be recommended as it suggests that really your mouth is too serious a property to be treated lightly and that you must think twice before calling its attention to a wine that may be a failure at the tremendous moment when the first sip of wine actually pawse our amateurs lips he must on peril of losing the whole of the prestige gained for him by a careful attention to all that has gone before withdraw the glass smartly from his mouth and look down at it as if it had offended him then his glance having gained new strength by this relaxation

the secret that was kept by elmzeth robins hutchinson 78 6d miss robins calls this romance in her subtitle a study in fear but apart from a certain anxiety lest her defaulting fugitive husband should be caught followed by a rather uncomfortable feeling that he may inconveniently intervene in her real love affair and a quite understandable dislike of american press publicity this story runs suavely enough without an oppressive heartbeat if it is a study in anything it is in the mind of north and south in their reaction to colour and from miss robinss point of view it seems to be the slave states which  think all gods chilluns got wings or at least souls the dramatic side of the story comes in with a bang in the penultimate scene when the dead husband returns to be really killed by his illegitimate son and his exwife takes the mild blame of shooting a burglar to hoodwink a rapacious press and keep her second husband unspotted from the world the brisk southern aunt and the free patriarchal atmosphere of the rural south best illustrate the writers established powers in depicting personality and atmosphere,unmarked

barbara ladd 13v charles g d roberts 6s con stable there have been many romances woven out of the conflicting interests and passions that gave colour and intensity to the early days of the american republic but we recall none of greater charm than barbara ladd and none that brings us into closer intimacy with the homely life of the period the story is picturesque and alive with human interest the characters are drawn vividly and with insight and humour the brothers dr jim and dr john with their long silent love of miss mehetable are delightfully quaint robert gault is an ideal hero within human limits but the most masterly study in the book is the headstrong lovable bewitching rebellious barbara herself it was worth writing and would have been worth reading if it gave us nothing else we can warmly recommend it as one of the few new novels that combine the elements of popularity with good workmanship  i barbara ladd by charles g d roberts constable  co our struggle with the insurgent colonies more than a century and a quarter ago has been the motive of some celebrated as well as merely successful stories the one under notice scarcely belongs to either class the heroine aged fourteen is more of a heroine even to her own family and intimate friends than the reader can understand the whole neighbourhood is   agog  over her small joys and sorrows the author begins with an account of a rather superior sunrise sunsets are a little out of favour it used so often to be  the last rays of the setting sun c now is it the influence of tess it is oftener  the miracle of dawn and so forth the heroine makes her dublt as a runaway at break of day an exit by drowning had been previously attempted but we need not add unsuccessfully before the reader has got far in her story or she far in her morning ramble he feels that enough running away has come off or as it were not come off devoted friends recapture the childor is it the woman it is difficult to say one moment she drums her heels on the waistcoat of a male admirer who carries her like a baby the next her hand is kissed and she is addressed as dear lady that her mother was a southerner is considered a sufficient reason that she should believe herself misunderstood by a northern aunt we had yearned for some show of severity from this connecticut lady but in vain she begins to  understand  her niece almost at once and to join the rest of the society in flattering her to the top of her bent two colossal brothers in their way almost as exasperating as the cheeryble brothers of dickens a maternal uncle a youth of high birth whose political faith differs from that of his ladylove and many others bow before her if the manners and speech of these people are in accord with the time and with one another it is surprising i  barbara ladd by g d roberts constable 6s by this time a novel that deals with the american war of independence must have something striking about it to deserve notice at all in america the subject is probably still of such absorbing interest as to command attention for itself but over here we look for something more in a story than the glorification of a patriotism that ceased to have any point for us in 177g  barbara ladd  opens so well that it suggests the existence of that something more quite half the book that half that deals with the childhood of the heroine is full of promise it is interesting and it has a certain amount of literary feeling but when barbara grows up when the scene of the story is transferred to new york the interest drops into the dreariest commonplace we do not find the very heartless coquetry of the extraordinarily beautiful barbara half so fascinating as the author evidently does and we grow horribly tired of her flashing eyes and her red lips and her wonderful hair and the war details are just like the war details of every other book of the kind families are of course divided against families lovers against lovers it is needless to add that barbara and her accepted lover have placed their sympathies in opposite camps the weakest part of the dook comes perhaps at the end where the construction completely breaks down and the feeblest of conclusions is arrived at in consequence the hero drags himself back to the home of his childhood having been severely wounded in a skirmish and the heroine opportunely goes out in her canoe and sees him fall fainting on the opposite bank of the lake the rest is easy to guess but in case there should be any doubt about what follows we quote the heros impassioned speech on his return to consciousness   listen my lady i will draw sword no more in this uarrel i have given my blood my landsi have given as thought my lovefor a cause already lost for a cause that i felt to be wrong from the day of lexington but whichever side wins i will stay in my own country if my country when it is all over will let me stay when i am well enough to go away love love will you go with me to return when the fighting and the fun cease to our own dear river and our own dear woods   everybody of course knows what happens when the wounded hero talks in this fluent way the moment his wounds have been dressed  barbara ladd by g d roberts  a new england story of the eighteenth century the vivacious young woman whom we first meet as she runs away from her aunts house is so obtrusively modern that we learn with surprise in the third chapter that the date of the story is 17o9 barbara was  an accident in her period an irreconcilable alien to her environment her later adventures are interwoven with some episodes of the rebellion but the tone of the book is modern throughout constable cs,unmarked

the garden of resurrection by e temple thurston 6s chapman  hall the refreshing feature of mr temple thurstons work is its individuality what he writes is emphatically his own and could not possibly be mistaken for any one elses work an anonymous  temple thurston  would be detected at once and though his popularity is a strong incentive to imitation no counterfeit has yet been produced which would deceive the experienced novel reader for a single chapter in a word mr temple thurston has a style he has created a new genre and for all that it appears so easy to copy he has somehow contrived to keep his formula secret as to the merits of the thurstonesque manner there may be two opinions but there can be no question of its popularity mr thurston has invented a new form of entertainment and his circulation proves that the public appreciates it his books are so easy to read that they produce an illusion of being easy to write but in reality the art of being sentimental without being sickly is not so simple as it looks and mr thurston adds to his gift of sentiment a keen eye for beauty in everyday scenes and an untiring capacity for enjoying life everything that is beautiful appeals to him and he can find beauty in much that to most people appears trivial or coramonplace the subtitle of mr thurstons new book  the love story of an ugly man is characteristic of his method for really there is no reason why the hero should have been more than ordiiarily plain except to excite the readers sentimental pity indeed mr thurston makes an unnecessary demand on the readers credulity whenhe suggests that the wealthy mr bellairs was so ugly that his ugliness made him repellent to women especially when the course of the story makes it clear that all the nice women in the book were not repelled by it at all if we were disposed to be critical we might complain that mfr thurston begins by claiming our sympathy for his hero under false pretences but mr thurston never gives the reader time to be critical lie sweeps on with such buoyant good spirits and frank enjoyment of natural beauty that we are hypnotised into aclpting his prenisses without demur  the garden of resurrection  has not the charm of  the city of beautiful nonsense and it contains one needlessly painful incident but it is very good thurston for all that  the garden o remurrection by e temple thurston chapman  hall in his latest novel mr temple thurston has evidently set forth with a steadfast resolve to be whimsical and fantastic at all hazards probability is thrown to the winds and the result as meredith tight have said is not  a revel of rough truth but a veritable banquet of extravagance the hero who is disfigured by smallpox so greatly that women turn from him with aversion outquixotes quixote in his pursuit and championship of a girl of remotely negroid ancestry whose name and circumstances are revealed to him by a conversation overheard by chance in a restaurant when betrayed and destitute she eventually seeks him out in spite of her previous prejudice against him he tends and finally espouses her it is a rather preposterous story told with some charm and agility together with a certain firmness of touch that reminds us of the authors earlier and less sentimental work his secession from the real to the aggressively pretty does not please us although it may make for an increase in general popularity  the garden of resurrection by e temple thurston i chapman and hall 6s it seems to us that bellwattlea curious nickname for a very nice ladywas quite right when she told mr bellairs that he was morbid about his ugliness although he may have been badly pockmarked and perhaps not originally endowed with a greek perfection of feature it was hardly necessary for him to wander so disconsolately through life believing himself a monster of unattractiveness he was really a charming gentleman in a mournful and at times slightly ridiculous way mr thurston has succeeded with great neatness in doing that rather difficult thing which is to make his hero tell his own story and remain the only person in or out of it who is ignorant of his attractions in mr bellairs quixotic venture of going to ireland to warn a helpless young girl whom a cad had brought over from dominica to marry and imprisoned in the house of his two shedragons of aunts we have nothing to lament exc3ept that he did not carry it out with more dash he failed to make her believe his warning and received as thanks a promise that the fair dominican would pray never to look upon him again this upset mr bellairs very much as he was already in love with her we think mr thurston insists a little too much on his hopelessness of inspiring a reciprocal passion mr bellairs who had longed so earnestly for romance scarcely realised it when it came but he acted entirely in character and that is the main thing in a sentimental romance just as much as in a bloodandiron work of realism we were genuinely pleased when he received his final reward mr thurston possesses that derided but not inestimable gift of painting a man who is a gentleman in all he does he is also a writer of a rare studiousness incapable of bad grammar and scorning an ugly cadence he is hardly robust enough to move us very deeply but he has in a marked degree the gift of being entirely readable we hesitate to say that he has charm because that word has been so cheapened by being bestowed where it is not deserved but if mr thurston does not object to sharing the quality with a good many rather questionable folk we cannot withhold it from him,unmarked

bullfight but we must not ourselves begin to be didactic when we get mr gaits works before us they always afford us so much for reflection and generally for admiration that we are apt to be tempted into prolixity putting aside the doctrine of the  lutherans we proceed to inform the reader that the tale is excellent the different phases of passion are extremely well described and the interest is actually absorbing were it condensed into five acts it would form an excellent drama the language when the occasion requires the expression of emotion is energetic to a startling degree this tale occupies the half of three volumes and it well deserves the space  the dean of guild the next story in succession is a burlesque clumsy and at the same time droll and humorousa sort of elderly peter simple he the dean takes his ignorance his scotch selfinterestedness and his tomfoolery into the presence of the three greatest characters of the day the duke of wellington earl grey and lord brougham with admirable tumhommie yet upon the whole the thing somehow clashes upon our sense of propriety  and the tory hankering not that we dislike the tories seems to twist the sketch into something like ungainliness there is a coveit attempt to make the same tories the possessors of all that is magnanimous in feeling and elegant and fashionable in taste how much better we should like mr galt if he

space occupied hythe jaunt the  craniologists  is a fearful tale and tends very much to subvert thc very conclusions that mr galt wishes to draw from it whether man be an agent or au instrument onlythough it is really un awful consideration in morals aud religionis of no consequence in social policy  for if one mau has the organ of destructiveness so fully developed that his murders are the inevitable consequences of his formation aud ho is no longer a free agent so the organs of caution are equally expanded in the rest of society aud they will as inevitably hang him the  sempstress is

i the gamnblers wife a novel by the author of  the young prima donna c inthreevols london 1814 newby    mrs grey excels in painting the pathetic now there is so great a pleasure in the exercise of any power of whose possession we are conscious that nothing claims more continual selfwatchfulness on the part of the novelist than the propensity unduly to indulge his peculiar talent at the expense of that variety which he who assumes to depict the world as it is never should lose sight of mrs grey has fallen into this common error she knows where her strength lies and she constructs all her plots so as to afford the most ample oppor tunities for its exercise  she fills her fictions with scenes of sor row  she is impatient of the smiling pictures which neverthe less are necessary for the introduction of her sombre ones she glides over them with speed and almost with carelessness until she arrives at the pathetic part of her story then she rejoices in her conscious power  her eyes brighten  thoughts throng thick and fast her pen traces them in bold characters she analyses the feelings lays bare every anguished nerve and to use an expressive term piles up the agony  with a skill that rarely fails to move the hardest heart and draw tears from the manliest eye admirably as this is done it is a fault that there is too much of it not only are all her novels of the sombre hue but there is more of painful picturing in each than can be approved by a critical judgment we admit the beauty of a great deal of this painting the exciting interest of the scenes the ability with which they are constructed and the eloquencewithwhich they are described  but there is alimit to the claims of the novelist upon our feelingstouch them but do not harrow them it must be remembered that it is onliv ideal sorrows with which we love to sympathize the sight of real suffering gives us pain nul the skill of the novelist is shown in conducting the reader to the point where the ideal may be excited to the ntmost stretch of emotion without tres l passing upon the realms of the real and producing pain or upon the cloudland of the unnaitural and toppling down the whole fabric fancy had reared airs glay certainly errs in stretching emotion too far and converting a  pleasing pain into a veritable anguish  and the impression whichi her novels leave behind them is that with which we remember somne terrible sorrow it has been our fate to witness in real life the fault for such it is may be readily amended for it grows out of her very excellence and we name it because it would be pity that so much real genius should not seek to be as perfect ai possible the gamblers w fife exhibits this fault together with all the excellences of its predecessors it is a most melancholy tale of treachery disappointment blighted hopes love misplaced misleading passions andl terrible retribution mlaud and mary sunderland are sisters the one proud and self willed the other gentle affectionate and yielding both are beautiful and maud in addition to her beauty has large expectations arthur balfour is a cousin who had been in childhood their playmate he visits them and falls in love with maud but will not venture to disclose his passion lest it should be thought he loved her for her fortune she however feels equal love for bhin which he discovers he proposes and is accepted at this moment harry percy another cousin a man of the world of middle age practised in deceit who has been ruined by gambling is invited to the mansion he discovers the expectations of mlaud and determines to win her from his rival for her wealths sake great skill is shown in the insidious manner by wbich this is accomplished he however succeeds in his design takes her from balfours arms and marries her the anguish of the betrayed lover is relieved by the sympathy of the gentle mary who soothes his griefs and as is inevitable in such circumstances pity becomes love and sympathy ripens into affection in the meanwhile the treachery of the elder pair is visited by retribution iu every terrible shape the angry father strikes mauds name from his will her mother dies brokenhearted her husband who had sought her only for her money disappointed of this subjects her to every form of tyranny and illtreatment he plunges into crime in the guilty knowledge of which she is compelled to parttci pate she is even made an innocent accomplice in a deed of blood to crown her misery she discovers that he has ceased to love her that he is faithless  and the last wretched plank to which she had clung having failed her she sinks in utter despairthe victim of pride selfwill and unbridled passion the scenes through which the reader is carried at the close of her career were those to which we alluded in the remarks with which we opened this notice with those qualifications we can award to the gamblers wife a very high place among the fictions of the season and confidently commend it to the circulating library and its patrons i i i i i i i i  the bankers wife whiativer the juliets of the literary world may say or think there is much  in a namemuch both of ill and of good and if the work we are now called upon to notice had happened to have made its appearance anonymously it would lhave offered a notable proof of both branches of the proposition mrs gores name in the titlepage will of course at once carry it into general circulation among the readers  the bankers wife or court and can ml and daughtes mrs armytage by mril gore authoress of mo of narrative fiction and will thus far prove the good of a name but had it been published anonymously though it might have linkered for a few short weeks on the shelves of the circulating libraries it would after a brief period have started into that sudden fame and popularity with all classes of readers from the most thoughtless to the most thinking which now it will be long in reaching even if it attain them at all the name of its writer first as that of a woman and secondly as that of a popular  novelist will long keep it out of the hands of those  grave and reverend signors who are the chief dispensers of that reputation which they cannot compass for themselves and who till they allow mrs gore to convince them of the fact by such books as the bankers wife will never be satisfied that a woman has been gifted with faculties of observing and setting forth the features of our common nature for the mingled delight and benefit of all for which they may look in vain among their own lordly sex the truth is that the bankers wife should have been written by a man or it should have been left possible by an anonymous titlepage to suppose it so written it would then have passed for the most masterly and instructive exposition that  ever put on paper of that lucrelust which is the most fatal and besetting vice of high civilization and which half neutralises all the virtues of that conditionits aarons rod which however swallows up all the other vices of our time only to disgorge them again in a more loathsome form than they possessed before of this  monster vice of our daythe vilest in its origin yet the most vast and all pervading in its effects mrs gore has here drawn a picture more moving and impressive to the moral sense than the loftiest fiction of old romance or the most soulsubduing dream of modern  sentiment  yet more true to the damning facts that daily beset the hearths and homes of every one of us than the most dry of ancient  chronicles or the most popular of  histories let not the mere novelreader feel alarmed by this opening glance at the new production of his favourite writer its  gaieties are at the least as light as sparkling and as profuse as its  gravities are weighty sterling and stamped with the impresses of moral and social truth if  the bankers wife is perhaps the most valuable and im portant contribution its accomplished author has yet made to that inestimable portion of our contemporary literature which aims at making its readers happier by making them wiser and better it is certainly inferior to none among the brilliant company of its predecessors in those inexhaustible powers of entertainment in which this remarkable writer yields to none of her living rivals and to a very few dead ones  the bankers wife is as we have intimated at the outset of our remarks notably a tale of the present dayof the actual day and hour in which we live and its second title of  court and city bespeaks the wide range taken by its scenes and characters in this respect none of mrs gores novels a ppeal to the tastes and associations of a more numerous body of readers besides the banker hamlyn the hero of the storywho wavers between court and  city and by rights

fiction the winged victory by sarah grand heinemann os net at any rate sarah grand has not sought as have some other novelists to put readers off with inferior matter in this time of all times her novel besides being what all fiction should beentertaining and recreativecontains much thought fitting for consideration today in fact we may credit her not only with having fulfilled the purpose of a novel but also with having produced at the same time a novel with a purpose to say that she had accomplished both things satisfactorily would be to number the book among the classics and that we cannot do for after gladly bestowing so much of appreciation we must unburden ourselves of our main criticism and then proceed to the consideration of her work in some detail her novel will accomplish its purpose we believe in widening the outlook of the average novelreader but to our mind in addition to other faults she has omitted the pith of the matter had she more plainly analysed the nature of the soil from which the roots of the tragedy drew their nourishment it would have been more helpful as she makes one of her characters say  causes are the things to attack not effects she does in fact inform us that the feet of her wingless victory were clay in so far as her motive power was largely the spirit of revenge on those who were responsible for the sufferings of the poor she had the intellect which  kims the surface it is reserved for the spirit whose advances she had slighted to plumb the depths she had taken her fate into her own hands when she preferred intellectual ascendancy to spiritual enlightenment but the whole setting is in a clay soil impervious to light and air the matter of the girls birth is wrapped in secrecy no less foolish than is usual in such cases the secrecy was as much a matter of the conventions as was the luxury with which even the authors best characters surrounded themselves while bemoaning the lot of the poor in not having more of the worlds goods forgetting at the same time how uneconomically they indulged themselves in superabundance the authors 4 big  man closes a sumptuous repast with what would have been blasphemous prayer had he been really big enough to understand the most elementary economy the income which he spent on himself must have been many times more than the average one of 222 for a man and his wife and three children we have no wish to be thought extremists to allow him but the average income would probably have quenched entirely his utility it is the authors blindness to the awful responsibility of her hero that we deplore the authors conception of the world is obviously that of a place where the intolerableness of conditions must be mitigated with the object of its becoming as efficient a school as possible for fitting its pupils for a heaven hereafter and else where in other words the author does not consider that the ideal of heaven on earth is ever likely to come within the range of practical politics the fact that we do not agree with her detracts not a whit from the value o4 the work considered from the authors own point of view and so from that point we will consider it the heroine possesses as did adnam the hero of 4 adnams orchard to which the book is the sequel in a literal sense if not in that usual in fictionan overabundance of excellence which however it is not very hard to credit her with though some of her qualities are difficult of acceptance in the light of her lowly origin in 4 adnams orchard  we had much dissertation on the land here the heroine ella banks who will be remembered as a lacemaker in the former book continues her calling though in very different circumstances the book opens with her being met by the duke of castlefield sayes solicitor who drives her straightway to the west end mansion which has been placed at her disposal society with the capital sthe sign manual of all that is sinfulis induced by the patronage of royalty to frequent her lace exhibition with the inevitable consequence that the protegee receives many unwelcome attentionsthe outcome of one of which involves her in homicide meanwhile she awaits the return of her lover the dukes son her marriage with whom she looks upon as the copingstone of the design by which she will accomplish her object of freeing the lace trade from the sweating conditions imposed on it by the profiteering middlemen meanwhile the duke lavishes wealth and caresses on her and pajrs her clandestine visits late at nightuntil at last the heroine awakens to the fact that scandal is busy with her name at once she believes that there is truth in the rumour which assigns discreditable motives to the dukes attentions in consequence she consents to marry the son without the fathers knowledge and immediately after is made aware that she is the dukes lovechild how the knot is cut we prefer to leave the reader to find out lest this which is to our mind a greater improbability than many which have preceded it should deter any one from the perusal of what after all is a novel far better worth reading than many based upon more likely happenings having very briefly outlined the plot we must allude to some of the admirable characterization there are delineations of the good and bad sides of society which are worthy to be mentioned along with the great names of thackeray and meredith the old lordly reprobate and his parasitic tailors model are two instances and not far behind these are the galaxy of coarseminded women on the other hand we have the princess who betrays her teutonic blood to a degree which will hardly be acceptable today but she is nevertheless a true and lovable presentment the touches with which character are delineated are excellent throughout but we can refer only to a few there ia the solicitorwho was so obviously a man who did not receive orders but was instructedwith his twitching nose reminiscent of a rabbit lady ami an epitome of her caste in all time she felt secure in the established order of good and evil considered that if there were people not equally wellsatisfied with things as they are those people were in the wrong and must be brought to heel and viewing the process from the height of a position whence unpleasant details were not visible to the naked eye she indignantly set aside as impertinent any difference of opinion on the subject that might reach her and was not tobe warned  then the duke her husband he might with justice have called himself a busy man and such business as his has its own importance many lives would have been disarranged and much inconvenience entailed had he neglected it but it was the business of a system of a great machine which ho had not set in motion and could not control it controlled him he was the tool of a machine which was working with results that he knew to be bad in many ways in great measure an ineffectual machine into the defective parts of which he meant to look but never did to any purpose besides his part in the working of the machine was obligatory and obligatory work is not soulsatisfying as an object in life peculiar to himself would have been how he found his real object in life we shall leave readers to discover for themselves some of the traits depicted are easily fitted to people well known a few years ago  but if they have been lifted from life they have been so mixed up as to render them void of any offence occasionally the characters appear to have got out of hand and we like them better freed of the authors control but they appear later to be ruthlessly subjugated to conform with the exigencies of the plot in an age when there is so much more writing and talking than thinking the novel strikes us as overlong towards the end and yet one cannot suggest any of the 650 pages which can safely be skipped,unmarked

praise this book even without reading it having read it however the task is changed into a claim of grateful duty  for seldom have we been more entirely pleasac and amused by any book of its class and certainly by not one of our own day the reader will gain a very aldequate notion of the peculiar nature of miss pardocs book and certainly not an exaggerated one as regards its merits and its powers of entertainment when we state that it is a sort of new arabian nightswith all the oriental tone and imagery of those fascinating fictionsall their rich and wild spirit of romance all their ingenuity and fertility of invention and incident but with one exception wanting that supernatural machinery which we are by no means sure is not the defect rather than the inerit of those still charming tales certain we are that when an equally exciting and attractive result can be obtained without wuch machinery and by circumstances probable to thinking and arrangements compatible with belief and  the romance of the harem by miss pardoe common sens the ultimate effect must be stronger and the merit bf the writer of a rarer at least if not a higher grade and such we venture to sy is the case in miss pardoes  romance of the harem there is for instance nothing in the arabian nights with their genui and perii and all their other is in number arguslike to boot that is more strange stirring and wondermoving than the story of the diamond merchant in these volumesnothing till the mystery is explained more unaccountable by any but supernatural agency than the seven doors and so of other of the stories it as true miss pardoe assures us that these exceedingly clever lively and amusing fictions  are genuine tales related by the professional alassaldjhes or storytellers of the fast in the harems of the wealthy turks during seasons of festivity but we must beg leave to doubt the validity of this modest avowal except in so far as relates to the groundwork of the several stories the superstructureincluding the sentiment imagery and passion and frequently the poetical spirit which pervades the taleand above all thle artistlike putting together of the parts and dovetailing them into one fair anrd consistent wholethe merit of all these we are confident belong to the fair and gifted lady who has now presented us with tile stories in an english attireenglish yet most appropriately ornamented and enriched with the jewels the flowers and the perfuimes of tile east nothing can be more pretty and piquant than the slight but shining web of fiction by which these brilliant fireflies of miss pardoes fancy are kept together the young beautiful and capricious wire of a not yoting and therefore for the time being doting pasha of a distant lrovince of turkey is

once of passion and poetical feeling as to give proniso that the  aching void recently made in our poetical literature by a late melancholy event may at no distant day be filled at least though it

vividly the stirring scenes and incidents in which he has taken part that when he disposes himself  to tell a tale his readers take up his book like children anxious to hear the captain carries them through mazy paths and tangled wildernesses dragging his character through dangers that make his readers hold their breath for a time he is too goodnatured however to break their hearts by any fatal occurrence or if tragedy there must be it is the right people who come to grief those whom the reader rejoices to see punished but after going through more dangers than they have hairs on their head and doing more hard riding fighting and forced marching than would have served all the paladins of king arthur put together they escape at last the heroines in full beauty without a scratch or a freckle upon their complexions even their costumes not materially disarranged or worse for wear whilst the heroes always find fortunes in their forays so that they are able to buy a fine estate to settle down upon when the curtain falls the true and graphic descriptions of tropical scenery and natural objects keep the critical faculty of the reader quiet and make him to accept amicably if not with faith the wild impossibilities of the narrative in this present novel however we are ungrateful enough to recollect that we have heard a great deal of it before the captain himself has told it to us those who have read the war trail will recognise the description of the  butte huerfano and the attack ofthe handful of white men hythe arpahoe tribe of indians who besiege them upon it their chief the terrible  red hand is not unknown to us also speaking as children we should say that the captain makes up his tale as he goes along with so many exclamations and insignificant incidents that the story is delayed to our great impatience the captain indulges in terribly fine words and fine writing who ever speaking the language of men talked thus the encarmined blossom of the bignonia to me a symbol of the sweetest sentiment i had carefully preserved in a glass i had placed it on the dressingtable of my chamber with its peduncle immersed in water lovers male and female have in all ages we suppose put cherished flowers in water but they would scarcely recognise the familiar instinct under such wonderful terms lovers may and do talk a great deal of nonsense no doubt but a young man might record his preference of a blonde beauty in less stilted language there was another contrast that had at this time an influence on my hearts inclinings to an eye fatigued with dwelling long and continuously on the dark complexions of the south the olivine hue of azec and iberian skins there was a relief in the radiance of this carmined blonde c but we would have forgiven all that if the progress of though story had not been slackened to allow whole ages of this sort of writing to find a place we also complain that the author who although many miles distant could know and tell us all that passed in the secret interview between the mormon apostle and huhman holt the father of the two heroines also what passed in the glade of the forest and the despair of the young hunter in his solitude never  tells us a word about how marian went away with the mormon nor how she discovered his villainy nor how she escaped from him nor how she fell under the protection of walker the good indian we are indeed told something about his finding her tied to a tree but so confusedly and vaguely that ordinary readers will never make it out the  secret by which stebbins the mormon held the father of lillian and marian in his power is never properly disclosed the whole story is diffuse in unnecessary places and most unsatisfactorily huddled up and hurried over when it comes to pointe of

hadrian the seventh bv fr rolfe 6s chatto mr rolfe writes excellent english but he writes too much of it he is diffuse and moreover has given less thought to the construction of his romance than to the purpose he had n composing it this purpose seems to have been to advocate sweeping reforms in the roman catholic religion so that a wav should be opened to a union of all the churches of christendom at the start we find his hero george rose a fervent and highminded roman catholic living alone smarting under a sense of the wrongs that have been inflicted on him by that priesthood to which he had aspired and b certain friends among his coreligionists presently a cardinal and a bishop the latter an old friend come to apologise for the treatment that had driven him into a lonely exile for the last twenty vears and to humble themselves and ask him to return into the fold that had rejected him he returns he becomes a priest and it must be admitted that his long confession at this juncture is a mixture of windy selfconceit and bombastic silliness then by an unexpected turn of events he is suddenly elected into the papal chair this gives him the chance of putting his ideals into practice but still he talks too much to himself and to others and the secret consultation with the german emperor who speaks of annexing austria russia and france is frankly ridiculous mr rolfe writes of english socialism with more assurance than knowledge and his thinly veiled references to mr blatchford mir burns and mfr keir hardie are in very bad taste the book is worth reading not as a novel but as the embodiment of some interesting ideas  hadrian the seventh e vftit  by f rolfe chatto cc w ina us ix spite of all the authors efforts we like this book his language which is singular enough to reveal his identity is appalling in its affectation and shows what can be done with misapplied education in fact the socialist vulgarity which he ridicules is infinitely superior to this unnatural and tortured verbiage the taste of some passages is unquestionable the silliness of the diatribes against socialism is only equalled by their violence karl marx had defects as a systemmaker but to treat all socialists as hypocritical selfseekers is both vulgar and stupid the machinery by which george arthur rose is turned into pope hadrian vii is very badly managed the story indeed is frankly impossible yet the authors power of impressionist drawing lights up the romance his genuine fund of ideas makes both the politics and religion interesting despite their improbability but the making of the book is in its characters they are al except the socialist vivid and real not merely is the pope allowed to display himself but every one of his friends and the cardinals is rendered interesting and lifelike the author has a real sense of scenic effect for the close of the book is dramatic without being theatrical on the whole  hadrian vii is a book to irritate if not to anger but at the same time to suggest and to delight,unmarked
the dowager or the new school for scandal loxdox saturday so iem vim 14 1840 reviews bv mis ore j vols hentley tm condition of a nations literature of that portion more particularly called thu helles ietlice is of far greater import than is always perceived even by the professed critic far hom involving a mero matter of taste and indicating only the intellectual grasp and refinement ofthe people it embraces no less than the whole round of their moral existence and throws ti trong light on their institution their habits their present capabilities and their future prospects thus thc declining literature of the 9 iealled silver age of latinity might have been tiken as a sign of approaching disorganization quite as trustworthy as that set forth in the pages of tacitus thus too the french literati ie of the eighteenth century so far foreshadowed tin coming revolution that it has since been itiolilily reckoned thc main cause of that catastrophe the literature of the fifteenth century we need not say was still more intimately connected with the changes going forward in the religious and political opinions of the great kuropean community everything indeed in connexion with literature is signiliciint the style the subjects the pervading spirit the moral consideration and even the pecuniary value are each the exponents of some peculiarity ia a nations condition exercising an influence on the destinies of the people hy the word morals is to be understood in this instance the whole range of habits political social and even material so that in many respects literature to be thoroughly understood must be studied out of itself in this us in iilinost all moral questions mankind are tinapes of their analytic habits  the intellectual man has been studied apart from the material a code of criticism has lieen established as available in all times aud under all circumstances and one common procrustean bed of t iste has been applied to the literature of all ciiintries it is not however by such a standard that the productions of a national mind cm be accurately valued the existing state of literature at any moment is a fact dependant on the whole circumstances of the moment on llie actual developeinent of the entire civilization with all thc external agencies by which it is at once excited and modified considering merely the canons of criticism the prevailing state of education the current acquaintance with rhetoric with the principles ol the sublime and beautiful or in one word with the si iencc and the art of composition it would he difficult to point out any vast difference between the actual generation of english writers and that which immediately preceded them  and yet the differences which distinguish their respective productions are many and salient the causes of such difference must be sought beyond the ordinary range of criticism and it will not lo lo talk of the decline of taste of genius ik ing at a discount or of a perverse tendency of writers to neglect those models and rules of art which made the fame or fortune of their predecessors of the changes which have taken place and ure still going on in the literature of our own countryand more especially agermane to the article before us in its fictitious narrativethe greater part in our opinion depends upon corresponding changes going forward in society itself lt is with novels as with the legitimate drama in both instances the audiences have changed and managers and publishers in their modern sub stitutions are following rather than leading the public taste to analyse these changes and to enumerate all the conditions out ol which they arise would be impossible within the compass assignable to a single article one of the most remarkable and pervading is the wider spread of literature and the consequent demand for inferior articles it is no longer the welleducated man of the world the philosopher or the studentthe naturally refined or the artificially polishedwho creates the demand and who consequently determines the fortunes of a new publication the public now addressed is of lower qualifications and the author cheerfully accommodates himself to a circumstance which spares him an infinity of labour and thought one immediate consequence is that no very high order ol mind being necessary for gauging the public intelligence the publisher becomes a better judge of the wants of his customers than the author if the author innot himself a mere tradesman  and it accordingly rests willi the publisher to determine the character of our literature from the returns of bis ledger be collects with statistical accuracy the sort of book which is wanting  and lie dictates to the author both the direction he is to take and the level he is to maintain another consequence of the new market opened to literature is the increased rapidity of its movement av ith the reduction in the value of the article demanded there coexists an increase of effective demand the supply of this demand while on the one hand it tempts or rather forces the author into a diminution of labour on the other has begot in the purchaser a diseased passion for novelty the latter acquires a habit of reading with rapidity  of reading without judgment and whatever tempts him to pause for reflection will throw him behindhand willi the march of publication if it does not thwart him by offering an insuperable obstacle to bis progress in this state of tilings the prolits of a quick return of capital acquire importance in the publishers eye lt is not the extent of sale but its rapidity that is chieily regarded and an indifferent manuscript purchased at a low price and driven through the inarki t at a handgallop is more esteemed than a valuable work whose purchase money is to be spread over many editions this state of the market combining with the increased diffusion of mechanical education bas also opened literature to a less qualified class of writers writing is a trade that requires no capital and all the minor talents excluded by their poverty from entering on other professions crowd eagerly into the publishing market thus in spite ol the daily increasing demand the market is effectually overstocked prices fall and the author who writes for bread the great majority of those who succeed in literature i is compelled to work with greater rapidity and to substitute the number for the inherent excellence of bis works at the back of these extrinie influences there exists a difference arising from a change going forward in the national manners a sort of intellectual effeminacy ariing out of a long peace and steady public prosperity the sympathies of the masses have lost something ot their healthy activity a cold selfishness and indifference to others have stolen over them which lune tended powerfully to introduce two very opposite phenomena in the literature of the day in one class of temperaments it has engendered a dislike to strong sensations of any sort a craving for the lightest species of amusement and a disgust for all sorts of writing which makes any very powerful calls on attention by pathos humour or even by an ordinary earnestness of purpose persons thus circumstanced whether plunged in the merest intellectual idleness or prtoccupicd by commercial or by political interests look to fictitious literature as a source only of pastime and repose  and it may be laid down as a rule that the greater the interests xvliich rest on the shoulders of the reader the nion iliinsy and trilling are the works of his predilection of another class cf temperament the very reverse may be predicted in the lower classes of society there is to be found an equal selfishness perhaps to that which reigns in thc higher but it is engendered by other causes their selfishness and apathy are for the most part the results of the severity of the struggle for existence and ofthe constant recurrence of uneasy sensations which while they blunt the sympathetic susceptibilities brace rather than overpower the mind with the loxver classes the desire for strong sensations predominates but these are not to be obtained through the ordinary channels of legitimate literature and for such readers are produced the atrocities of the newgate school the adventures of buccaneers ihe sea novels and other tales of course and exciting adventure without proceeding further at the present moment in this analysis enough xve imagine has been said to account to a certain extent for the phenomena xvhich mark the present era of literature and distinguish it from that of tue last generation the change is not wholly indifferent to criticism itself the critic as belonging to the public must of necessity adopt sonic portion of its prejudices like other more dignified persons he must find his nature subdued to the atmosphere in xvliich he lives ihit were ibis otherwise if critics and authors were not in fact the same individual it would be unfair in the former to place themselves in the higher regions of their art or to measure the anthills ol one generation by the standards of another and it xvould be as usclesas it is

has stumbled somewhat she has really not aj little of the raiuuto fidelity of detail the easy manner and the nice perception of character which make miss austen s itooks so delightful but mero writing mere wordphrasing views drawn from books and though want of that compactness and singleness of purposo which the charm of reality gives to a 6tory however slight in texturo or apparently unconnected interfere to spoil those better qualifies still it is long since we read a book of this class with upon the whole greater promise in it the scenes are too many the connexion too slight and the canvas too much spread for the subject that fills it but it is impossible not to recognise and enjoy the shrewdness the familiarity with kioks as well as life and the social whim and satire displayed in the course of the tale the opening sketch of the luttrells is so good that we attribute something of the sense of failure in the later scenes to an expectation thus somewhat too highly raised but mr francis luttrell is good to the last so is the mother of the heroine and in the touches which mark poor mies esther s transition to old nwiidisra as well as in the jilting flirting match making and matchescaping which appear to be always going on there is enough of humorous observation and common life truth and sagacity to render the next appearance of the author of the fair carew a matter of some interest to us we han had proof of mrs howitts taste in foreign literature which warrants ns in receiving with some degree of confidence any new name she may introduce to us so hai again gone

tohrul tranj1 mt    of the jews which ma make jfftfrlf     life nmnnert m ta rfu belong to another hemisphere tins is true but the book is also something more than this it is the production of a writer of genius you feel this when you have advanced a few pages and the feeling never leaves you even through the comparative failure of the last volume what his exact drift may have been in writing such a book wo do not quite see  for we more than doubt if its tendency can be held favourable to the jewish community though it conveys to thc christian some grave and important lessons but the people brought into a book by a man of genius are apt to do and say for themselves more than appears to bo formally set down for them  and this we may accept as in some degree explaining what many will think the unsatisfactory impression produced by jacob bendixen it is not simply the christians who are intolerant the narrative would seem to teach us  but the jews also  and from that clash of intolerance on both sides we must draw for ourselves what silent lessons of tolerance we may they will not be few or unimpressive when the book is rightly read it opens with a picture of the hems boyhood and of the influences stamped indelibly on those tender years when to the brand of caste is added that of persecution here there are several very touching passages made doubly effective by the contrast which immediately follows of the ame youth oast suddenly amid the livelier enjoyments and larger life of a family of christians the result is that his faith in all that may be called extrinsic to the jewish dogma is shaken  and we could have no better evidence of the writers ability than though effect which this produces on though jewish household wo so how injustice begets injustice and to what evil issues persecution tends in continuing though very bigotries from which it draws excuse and support observing this unfavourable side in though persecuted race we are next shown th less favourable side in the christian and a love engagement into which thc hero has entered closes in mortification and despair we do not think the subsequent scenes in france and algeria very successful in so far as the story is concerned but the writing continues to to admirable  and with the return of the jew to copenhagen his fall into the worldly habits of his tribe the blighted lifo and mean pursuit showing still the old liberal and noble nature and finally his funeral with the accompanying yells of the mob and though stones thing against his coffin wo close a book which is calculated to leave a strong and salutary impression j on all but the most superficial readers of the conrail and thc harem wo may simply say that though story hardly justifies the title it is a romantic tale of the civil wars of italy in though middle ages narrated originally in choice italian and to which madame pisani has given a graceful knglish dress neither convent nor harem figure in it however except that from the latter ono of its heroines emerges and in the former its other heroine earnestly longs for repose though scene is stormily filled with guelph and ghibeline and though principal incidents aro those of that terrible contest between ugolino and kuggieri of which dante has made such appalling use in his immortal poem very different is the scene and strangely contrasted the actors in the last story on our present listantony the deaf and dumb boy this is a strange poor inartificial not very interesting novel and yet it contains things so redeeming that we could not but read it through extravagant as the incidents are and preposterous and incredible j as the means hy which the author would inculcate that the j worst mishaps of life may be conquered by patience patience  in this case having had obviously nothing to do with it j we shall nevertheless recollect antony with pleasure  the author may be an indifferent artist but he is evidently i a kind zealous goodhearted man  with an eye for fresh natural scenery and a desire to heap happiness on all he likes or cares for which much commend himself in turn to the liking of his readers but dont let anybody read the book under a persuasion that it is a sermon preached from the text of the good french abbe of deaf and dumb notoriety because it is really nothing of the kind the hero certainly is born deaf and becomes quasidumb but he recovers his speech is cured of his deafness and ends with all manner of happiness and honour and glorification though book must simply be read for the pleasant occasional

the silver fox by martin ross and e g somerville 6s lawrence and bullen they dont even write hunting stories in ireland after the ordinary fashion these should according to every orthodox standard be of an honest crudity of colour and clamorous with strident laughter calculated to reach the senses after a hard days riding in the keen air now this is a hunting story horses and hounds seem very real things in the writers bands and yet it is a delicate piece of work quite unfitted to keep a sleepy squire awake it offers him subtleties and fine tones and he will only snort indignantly if told the subtleties and delicacies are real things observed and divined with wonderful accuracy the audacity does not stop there the supernatural is introduced not in the shape of an honest creditable old family ghost with a clanking chain in the blueroom either but of an uncanny slinking fox that heralds misfortune because its lair in the hillside has been disturbed when gravel was wanted for a new railway we are not quite sure of the success of that fox the matter for all the calamities was there independent of him but it is as impressive as and a good deal less disagreeable than the yellow dog in i the carissima all the rest is excellent lady susan is a fine photograph she is the kind of woman to be treated by the photographer slaney the dreamer with brains and a tender heart is exquisitely

kissed once to find it a trembling and human one she also had a delicate clever hand we are glad bunbury won it in the end the authors sail gaily between shoals and over rocks when tragedy is

shrewd christmas book  doctor birch and his young friends by mr m a tit marsh chapman and hall the eccentric movements of mr titmarsh will be a great puzzle to posterityif he should happen to make that distant and desirable acquaintance when we last shook hands with him he was pursuing the fine arts in a hnmble way in pocklington gardens but for the last year or so it would seem he has been assistant master and professor of the english and french languages flowerpainting and the german flute in doctor birchs academy at rodwell regis by what necessity pitchforked into that situation we have not uie remotest means of knowing nevertheless mr titmarsh is still mr titmarsh naturam expellas furcdhut nature comes wk all the same just as he violated the confidences of private lite in the ease of mrs perkins and made traitorous use of his opportunities of observation when he lived in the pocklington quarter he now shows up the family of the birches and unsparingly describes the various young gentlemen whom he helped to j teach at the rodwell regis academy  the doctor himself would seem to be a kindly man enough but deplorably ignorant with an insolent oxford puppy of a son and under uie thumb of a tyrannical old sister they have a roung nieee miss raby who is very pretty and very jioor teaching the children in the lower school for ber bed and board there were two lads at the school some seven years before mr titmarshs time sons of a captain out in india the younger of whom tended in his sickness by little miss raby like a sister the old woman getting all the credit and the thanks and the silk shawls from india had died and the elder first falling in love with his brothers nurse had run away and joined his father in ahmednuggar mr titmarsh learns this gradually having conj ceived a tender sympathy for miss raby and liking to hear her talk it is not at all clear to us indeed that he is not on the very eve of a declaration when what we may call the catastrophe of his present narrative arrives this is in the shape of young davison from india  the old pupil who revisits the school one morning suddenly pays ancient unsettled debts to the old tartwoman gets a holiday for the hoys stuffs them with bullseyes and polonies and carries off the governess such is the framework slight but sufficient in which mr titmarsh sets his juvenile portraits first comes the cock of the school champion major who is a large strong lazy goodhumoured blueeyed capable fellow as magnanimous as he is brave and the favourite of everybody then there is hulker who would be almost as great a favourite if he were not poor fellow so stupid  one of those honest generous active incorrigibly dull boys that fill one with love and pity and hatred of the latin grammar mr titmarsh shows his kindly wisdom in showing his sympathy with hulker then there are the briggss who are apt to sink low in the school and get bullied till a hamper from home mollifies persecution and a general feast in the bedroom sets all to rights next there is bullock a clever mean cowardly plodding carefol humbug who cheats the litue bovs prac tices usurp on the big ones and is  pretty sure to succeed  in the world ak there is duval who plunders tarts m a more open and gentlemanly way borrows halfsovereigns and brags continually of the splendour of freenystown county cork where his father drinks claret

the turquoise cur by arthur cosslett smith the volume contains two stories  the turquoise cup  and  the desert the cup was the one in the treasury of st marks which the earl of vauxhall desired to purchase for the heiress who had consented to marry him on that condition there is a cardinal archbishop with a sense of humour and the story has a pleasing atmosphere of comedy the desert opens in an oasis of the sahara lane 5s  the turquoise cup and the desert by parthur cosslett smith ulustrated lane literature and menus are often associated in metaphor and mr arthur cosslett smith shall tempt us to honour the bond his bookapparently his firstsuggests that spectacular course the sweets it reports of the mould but the artifice of it is pretty and charming its sugariness a value and not a concession  the turquoise cup is in motif reminiscent of a story by mr edgar jephson who has preceded mr smith in the idea of a gentleman with a sense of honour attempting a splendid theft the principal character is a cardinal whose limp is mentioned with a frequency which would be vulgar if it did not obviously address itself to our  sense of tears to him we owe the witty observation that  when an englishman is embarrassed he is truly penitent he is magnificently uppermost when mr smiths earl is in the foolish throes of contrition humble he is grandiose he gets full rhetorical value for an early blight of affection novelists can arrange these things and long may they continue to do so more remarkable and with a heroine in extreme contrast to the droll irishwomen who enliven with gusty laughter the story just criticised is  the desert a tale of north africa one is to imagine a cameldriver commissioned to hand over the girl he loves to a woman who exploits courtesans tragedy is averted so simply and smoothly that the art of the story is wholly in the telling  but here the art not only suffices but rejoices admirable are some of mr smiths flashlights on different types of arab character  the turquoise cup by arthur cosslett smith 6s john lane there are two stories in mr smiths volume both excellently written it is true the plots in each case are flagrantly impossible the turquoise cup has even a hint of foolishness the whole matter is not only beyond the reach of illusionit is based upon the ridiculous but the manner of its treatment is absolutely delightful the incident is short but for the brief period of its lasting every scene is visual and the sketch of the cardinala cardinal belonging to the only type now permissible in fictionis a finished piece of portraiture the success of the turquoise cup in fact is supremely one of style but in its ven success lies an element of danger which the author would do well to bear in mind for this stylelight selfpossessed always to the pointis strongly reminiscent and like all styles touched consciously or unconsciously by extraneous influences would very easily degenerate into affectation the cardinal for instance is as we have said a distinct and charming person only he is also a little familiar we feel that in dealing with him mr smith was not entirely able to forget the other delightful witty cardinals and their relations with fascinating but irresponsible young women which have become a phase of fashion in fiction in the desert mr smith seems more unhampered and this little story of the east suggests a pleasant gift of invention in both cares however mr smith has written a genuine short story and not an incomplete fragment published under that title,unmarked
  new novels the rose of life by m e braddon hutchinson  co the mighty influence of the zeitgeist is plainly discernible in this latest work of the veteran novelist thirty years ago it would have seemed unlikely that miss braddon would ever write a novel depending for interest less on plot than characterization yet such is the enterprise which she has here not unsuccessfully achieved the popular poet with his attractive egotism his ready though chiefly vicarious philanthropy and his genuine superiority to snobbishness and all its works is well conceived and so harmoniously developed that when he is detected in the act of swindling one of his best friends the disclosure though dramatically unexpected does not strike us as inconsistent with what we already know of him his simpleminded devoted wife is also good in her way and has the merit rare in that particular type of woman of conciliating sympathy rather than rousing irritation the villains male and female the heroine and the titular hero are none of them of much account and the device of the bigamous marriage scarcely appeals to us as it did in the days when it was a comparatively new thing in fiction,unmarked

strangers at lisconnel by jane barlow hodder  stoughton an authority on idylls says rather testily   after the use made of the word by tennyson in his idylls of the king which are epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragic in their incidents it becomes very difficult to say what may not be called an idyll this is cowardly to put the mildest censure on it surely a man and a scholar after reading poems epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragio in their incidents should find it very easy to say  there are compositions whioh may not be called idylls of such are these poems of the king i will not believe that even the shade of tennyson could be set aquiver by a quiet polite comment to that effect meanwhile it is here not so important to decide what is not an idyll as it is to deoide what an idyll is the word  idyll looked into is seen to mean  a little picture   and all the best idyllmakers from theocritus to jane barlow have given us little pictures for a little pioture it might naturally be supposed that one would ohoose a little subject a cottage rather than a castle little claus rather than big claus this again is what the best idyllmakers have always done even when the doing of it must have gone somewhat against the grain the great pastoral poet of greece makes an infamous act the theme of his eulogy because the doer of it was ptolemy the great pastoral poet of greece was partial to royalty but he did not make royalty dominate in his idylls lycidas was a goatherd goatherds harvestmen fishermenthese we meet in the famed idylls of greece very different they are from their brother  craftsmen whom we have known in the flesh if theocritus has drawn them truthfully the explanation of this fact is to be found in the time and the clime in which they lived their world was younger than ours by two thousand years the sky above them was a sicilian one well might they in the worlds youth and worlds garden live a life so free from care that they had to  make up  their sorrows 1 it is profitless perhaps but it is rather tempting to conjecture what would have happened to them if they had been sent  jumping oer times  the bold phrase is shaksperes to our time and if they had been brought to a standstill at lisconnel among goatherds harvestmen and fishermen in a world older by two thousand years with an irish sky over this bit of it among folk whose life is so laden with care that they have to  make up  their joys my feeling is that even lycidas who goatherd as he was could recite poems of his own composition upon occasion would have succumbed to what to any but a grey eye or soan irish eye would seem lamentably lacking in matter for poetry it is impossible to praise in excess the consummate skill with which miss barlow has made anew little pictures of the loveliest with this drear lisconnel for background and in the foreground nothing brighter than the blue of mrs kilfoyles cloak for what painters call a point of colour they who echo the famous german who said ich hasse ail zweitenmale may put down strangers at lisconnel at once  for it is nothing but what it calls itself  a second series of irish idylls no better than the first because better could not be but as good a fact which should be emphasised because there are people who think that as good could not be jerry dunnes basket is as witty as any story in the first series and is notable on another account till it appeared daudets little tale called  la mule du pape  was probably the best story of this kind yet told it is now the second best miss barlows being by just as much better than it as an irish toss of the head is bettermore sweet and commendablethan a french kick  jerry dunnes basket tells of an irish toss of the head and  la mule du pape  tells of a french kick of the pathetic stories more especially among them  mrs kilfoyles cloak  a good turn  boys wages  con the quare one i should like to write at great length but space forbids it is here possible only to give a few of the many passages in these tales and others which one marks as showing  the quality  of them we are taken out of the bogland for a look abrpad  the road climbs to the top of a hill and stops there abruptly as if it had been travelling all the while merely to look at the view there is only one writer living who could have written that and only one writer living who could have written this  the shower was a vicious one with the sting of sleet and hail in its drops pelted about by gusts that ruffled up the puddles into ripples all set on end like the feathers of a frightened hen as a sample of miss barlows own satire which is real irish point take this  ody was leaning against the wall critically examining brian kilfoyles blackthorn and forming a poor opinion of it with considerable satisfaction not that he bore brian any illwill but because this was his method of attaining to contentment with his own possessions sometimes there is a sounding of the profundities what was there in it asks thady before the beginnin of everything thady was a small anxiouslooking child whose pale and peaky face his mother often likened regretfully to a haporth of soap after a weeks washing he had spent a surprisingly considerable part of his six years in metaphysical speculations and was always disposed to make a personal grievance of the difficulties in which they constantly landed him his tone was now rather peremptory as he repeated what was there in it before the beginnin of everythin   sure nothin at all said his elder brother peter to whom the answer seemed quite simple and satisfactory but joanna looked as if ene had caught sight of some distant object which provoked hard staring   then what was there before the beginnin of nothin   pursued thady 4 dunno said peter indifferently  unless it was more nothin   sure not at all that wouldnt be the way of it joanna said dreamily yet with decision  if there was nothin but nothin in it thered ha been apt to not be eer an anythin ever whered it ha come from y dont be tellin the child lies peter why for one thing she said her tone sharpening polemically and taking a touch of triumph there was always god almighty in it and the divil maybe thats what you call nothin  peter evaded this point saying what peter said will be found in the tale called con the quare one i do not give it for two reasons i want the reader to go to the book and i want to give another passage you are to know that a theft has been perpetrated in lisconnel a thief has appeared there his appearance is followed by that of policemen it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of two active and stalwart civil servants would have been welcomed as happening just in the nick of time yet it argues an alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means possible the men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to the category of pitatyblights rintwarnins fevers and the like devastators of life that dog a man more or less all through it but close in on him a pitiful quarry when the bad seasons come and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin wid the hunger and his own heart is broke therefore to accept assistance from them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most reprehensibly unnatural to put a private quarrel or injury into the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the public foe a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a trivial temporary convenience lisconnel has never been skilled in the profitable and useful art of utilising its enemies not that anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments much less attempted to express them in set terms when a policeman appeared there was an inquiring mood what people said among themselves was  musha cock bim up i hope hell get his health till i would be tellin him or words to that effect while in reply to his questions they made statements superficially so clear and simple and essentially so bewilderingly involved that the longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle them there is a very general idea in england that irelands history has been written by moore lecky froude keating and some others and there has grown up a practice of late years of rather industriously studying these writers who are some of them interesting but are none of them quite reliable it is a curious fact that the writer who is the best historian that ireland has yet bad miss jane barlow is not only more reliable than any of the historians named above but is also immeasurably more interesting than any of them froude is considered by those who do not trust him wholly to have had a pretty wit it becomes very ugly when compared with wit like the above perhaps it is after all not for nothing that irish wit is accounted the prettiest

short stories dunky fitlow by a e coppard cape 7s 6d among contemporary writers of the short story there are few whose work has been so consistently exciting and disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it there for it renews ones hopes in mr copards future mrrk i il e vam  short sto ries by c henry warren midsummer night madness by sean ofaolain 7s 6d jonathan cape sally go round the moon by h e bates 3s 6d white owl press mr sean ofaolain is a newcomer to the ranks of the short story writers of today this is his first book and it places him right away among the best of that handful of young writers who realising that the short story is the twentieth centurys most individual contribution to literature have schooled their genius to this highly disciplinary form the modern short storyas witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with fiery sharpness in fifty pages the author can give a degree of reality to the lives of his characters which many novelists never achieve in four hundred but the best story in the book is  the small lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed to stand alone   sally go round the moon  is a long short story by a young writer whose work has for some time been attracting the discriminating few mr batess special forte is stories in a delicately lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the

  a wild proxy by mrs w k clifford hutchinson this is surely an early and very immature work of mrs clifford it bears traces here and there of the hand of a clever writer but not of the hand that made  aunt anne the story is too wild to rouse any feeling but impatience and merreday the end of the nineteenth century rochestercumbyron who talks poetic rubbish and cheap cynicism all in a breath and who wishing to act the demon only plays the fool is a nightmare the worst of it is that mrs clifford keeps serious in his presence  a wild proxy by mrs w k clifford hutchinson fit uoj granted that the situation mrs clifford has hit upon in a wild proxy is strikingly original and that the riskiness of the story is minimised by the breathless rapidity of its action we must confess that the tale fails to convince us of its reality which was never the case with  aunt anne this demon best man of mrs cliffords tale who has  such a way with him that he elopes with a bride on the very day of her wedding and keeps up the game by dispatching forged telegrams which purport to come from her too impassive husband is a barely conceivable character and even if we go so far as to admit that his proceedings are possible we feel with that astute young lady miss hilda wangel that  it wouldnt end there of course it wouldnt and when the runaway couple finally separate at leghorn the confiding reader becomes aware that he has been cheated by the author with a whimsical unconventionality of the natural outcome of these loverlike journeyings by land and sea in short helen halstead would either have waited for her rightful lord and master flopping overcoat and all at dover till doomsday or she would have gone with the fascinating frank merroday  a few steps furtherto the devil the  demon  lover is by no means so dear to the masculine as he obviously is to the feminine mind in this particular instance he acts to put it bluntly like a cad and for all bis effervescence and enthusiasm like a coldblooded specimen of the genus it is born in upon the impartial observer of life that women not infrequently fall in love with this sort of creature to the discomfiture of worthier if less exciting admirers but men are apt strangely enough to begin by despising him and to end after a sufficient acquaintance with his peculiarities by kicking him out of their houses mr rudyard kipling is to some extent responsibleas witness the story of the gadsbys and other examples that might be citedfor the rise of this new variety of hero who uses a woman as a doormat and walks ont in search of fresh amatory experiences over the prostrate forms of his earlier victims but mrs clifford has certainly succeeded in improving upon the type this is the way in which frank merreday talks on his return from the  sentimental journey  to his confidante mrs percy ives   you knowyou know how it is i neednt tell you a slip of a girl of twenty this time last time it was a woman of fiveandthirty  i trampled her into the dust brute that i am and left her there now this girl is returning the compliment i dont believe that i ever really cared a jot for any other woman in the world unless it was you i shall always love you dearbut that is different and this is the way his  dear idiot jean galton throws herself down under his boots a little desperation spread itself over her calm face as she answered i couldnt live without you if you cant give me more than you do now i must be content and thankful to have that i believe you would do anything on earth for me he said with wondering conviction yes anything on earth she repeated in her clear voice full of unflinching affection  i would work like a slave for you day and night i would be a beggar in the street if it would do you any good i would let you kill me if you liked i dont know anything that i would not do for you no matter how badly you treated me in return he looked down into her eyes while she spoke he saw her deficiency in charm her homeliness he noticed curiously the eager birdlike expression on her face he felt compassion for her and grateful to her but above all he felt the hopelessness of its ever being possible that he could give her more than he gave her now it is in passages like this that what is wanting in mrs cliffords book becomes apparent it is clever fresh cynical epigrammatic stimulating picturesque  all these qualities are abundantly present in  a wild proxy as they have been in everything that wo have seen from its authors pen since the publication of her  anyhow stories we will tell her frankly and in a spirit of perfect friendliness what it is the volume lacks it is that secretion of a wise brain and a warm heart that lends a charm to the work of the great novelists of our race from fielding to thackeray and is known for want of a better name as  the milk of human kindness we are sure she possesses it but it should not be absent even from jeu ov esprit like this,unmarked
mrs blake a story of twenty years by mrs newton crosland 3 vols hurst  blackett mrs newton crosland has always given promise of excellence which in the present work she honourably redeems the story of  mrs blake is interesting more for the variety of characters introduced who cross each others path and act and react upon each others destiny exactly as human beings do in actual life than for intricacy of plot they all seem reflections of real people though they are not all drawn with an equally firm hand the observations and reflections appeal to the readers sympathy from their truth as well as from the singularly pleasing tone in which they are given indeed in nothing is the improvement made by mrs newton crosland more manifest than in the style of her writing there is a clearness in the ideas and a vigour of expression which have not marked her writing before mrs croslands mind seems to have matured within the last year or two and there is a repose and simplicity in her style which speaks of something better than mere literary progress the story of  mrs blake might with propriety have been called the discipline of life the scope of the work is to show the different ways in which people may be trained and taught so as to become the best of what in their respective ways they are capable of becoming the different qualities that work to different but complete resultsthe faults that may be trained to the virtue that they the most affect  diversity of gifts but the same spirit of aspiration after that which is good are all well and delicately marked mrs blake who gives title to the book is a worldly clever artificial woman who takes a great deal of breaking and grinding both by prosperity and adversity before the defects of her qualities become their cognate virtues millie farrel the young authoress is a sketch from real life and is a true portrait of the modem literary working woman the episode of barbara neville is tenderly told and is less unpleasing than stories about lovely young women who stoop to folly generally are the men are less successfully drawn they are all uttntaa1 men drawn from the outside with very little knowledge displayed of their contradictions and general ways wilberforce serle tba young preacher is only a sermon put into action not a human beingand all the men are more or less like him mrs newton crosland has evidently worked out many of her own private thoughts and opinions and done this in preference to seeking to weave the incident of a story that there is a personal satisfaction in this mode of treatment cannot be denied but in her next book we would beg to he indulged with more of a tale grownup readers are all children in their hearts and will give up a good deal of wisdom and at least the good half of a moral for the sake of a good storyand mrs crosland must take readers as they are notwithstanding however the slightness of the story mrs blake is an interesting book,unmarked

similar veracious and unprejudiced sources of information must give way in respect to american literary capacity if in the more elaborate and profound ramifications of literature and science america must from the nature of things remain a long time behind us we are strongly disposed to think that in certain branches of the belles let ires it will soon tread very close upon our heels lt is a grievous thing doubtless that a spark of emulation should be lighted up in the very quarter which has been made the principal object of attack but go it is the xz generation of essayists novelists minor poets and men of sportive wit and fancy as bays says  about the town seem to be the class which american genius will more quickly overtake and with some respectable exceptions it is precisely these nondescripts who decry american capability the most we have always thought such exultation unworthy first because from the nature of things the united states could not spawn so many of these minnows and secondly it would have been a pity had the fact been otherwise lt is now easy to be seen that with all the advantage of the native production of the mother country as leisure and education increase in america the usual results will follow we can allow everything to internal circumstance and longconfirmed association but we cannot admit that a people sprung from ourselves growing up into

the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity,unmarked

fiction sinister street by compton mackenzie martin i secker 6s t here are five hundred closely printed pages in t this book yet we are informed that it is but the half of the novel and that the other half will follow early next year there is nothing here that is not as it should be but we do feel inclined to take mr mackenzie aside and complain to him when we find that in spite of those five hundred closely printed pages the novel has not even begun it has not even begun in the most elementary sense of giving us someone to be interested in the present book purports to recount for us the life of one charles michael saxby fane until the time when he orders his thoughts towards oxford and the most exacting lover of detail will not deny that facts and details enough are given of the life supposed to have been led by that same charles michael saxby fane but the unfortunate fact is that he has not yet begun to exist he is but a name that serves as an excuse for an elaborate description of childhood and school affairs it is not until page 350 that some of the names begin to distinguish themselves into personalities and even after then the i distinction is not developed that is to say the characterisation is not worked out whether in terms of action or psychology and when the book concludes the potentialities of conduct and therefore of interest still do not exist when such a state of affairs occurs with a novelist of the promise of mr mackenzie it is interesting to see how it has been caused to be compelled to deny at the end of a considerable book that there is no such person as its ostensible hero is not sufficient that is only a method of evasion and if nothing else prevailed mr mackenzies standing as a novelist protects him from that easy device and when we come to examine the book closely an interesting artistic problem reveals itself that happens incidentally to concern in its implication a good deal of modern work in the novel for the novel is not a hotchpot into which anything and everything may be emptied the position of each detail is exactingly circumscribed by its significance any portion of any description that is not there for the better understanding of the central concern is just so much waste tissue and the natural result of the inclusion of such indeterminate matter must be that the central concern will be hindered in its proper development that sounds academic enough to be sure and though every defiance of academic statements is all to the good yet mr mackenzie does not justify himself there is for instance a chapter entitled characteristically enough unending childhood and in it is little that could not with advantage have been eliminated fane might have had to repeat mensa mensa mensam and so forth in a meaningless ceremonial we ourselves had to do so but we suggest that it is nothing to the purpose that we should be told of it fully we donot presume to say that to mr mackenzie that ceremonial had not some significance but he has not conveyed it to us and that is the test of the book in fact it seems to us that mr mackenzie himself has felt this for he bends his mind to making these endless details interesting for themselves by his witty telling of them and that is excellently legitimate though it does not alter the fact what is it to us that we should be told of the paper flowers that michael made at the kindergarten or of his difficulties with et and iny in the special  had these things with many other such details fully told been cut out would the book have suffered  we are compelled to answer our own question by saying frankly that the book in its present form would have suffered such details have come to occupy so large a part that the chief interest is derived from them and not from charles michael saxby fane on whose account they were ordered we are quite sure that this was not at all what a novelist like mr mackenzie meant he quotes at the outset the passage from one of keats letters to the effect that the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in a ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thicksighted that is as it were his text every external incident therefore only has significance in the degree in which it refers to this factor otherwiseof psychology but he has turned aside from artistic restraintor let us say more precisely his restraint in artand let himself loose in details that have not that significance with the result that they have crowded out the exposition of adolescence he intended have banished michael fane and reign in his stead yet even here a curious thing transpires for the events of the latter half of the book are in themselves a great deal more interesting than the events of the first half while being at the same time a great deal more in exposition of the personality that fane in consequence begins now slowly to acquire it is with the later introduction of michaels friend alan and the contrast that mr mackenzie now sets himself to display between the two that the wheels of the story begin to grip the metals but the whole fault of the book at least thus far is that it is not depicted from within outwards but from without inwards often not reaching the inner complication of nerves and desires blood and emotions and resolutions at all that is even the case in the episodes of adolescence though these are described as vivaciously as we should expect from mr mackenzies pert the lack of condensation has indeed taken off the vivid glow from his style but its general witful attitude remains though it shines no more and this is especially so with regard to the latter half it is not altogether easy to arrive at conclusions since the book itself does not our judgement is left like our interest in midair it would seem that mr mackenzie never intended originally to publish the book in two halves if he had he would probably have made each half selfcontained and selfconsistent and this particular half is neither one nor the other going lamely and uncertainly as a consequence the other half is to be expected next year perhaps the two halves will fit perfectly together and give each life if they do we shall rejoice yet at the moment our interest remains in suspended animation  fiction social studies sinister street by compton mackenzie vol ii martin seeker 65 another six hundred pages concerning michael fane  we will pay mr mackenzie the compliment of believing he could have conveyed in half the number of pages all that is essential to the understanding of the two phases of his heros life here treated wo can also affirm that there are few pages which do not carry the reader on with fresh zest book iii is a vivid presentment of oxford life though we are glad to know that detailed as it is it is not a complete picture the hero is now more than ever the young man cursed with the knowledge that all possible precautions have been made against its ever becoming necessary for him to earn his own living occasionally he is vaguely conscious of a desire to be something more than a consumer all his life  more often he is merely depressed by the futility of things as he sees them he takes part with relish in drunken orgies accompanied by a burst of destructiveness which would have been an outrage if carried out by a suffragette or a german but which many may consider creditable in his case for at the bidding of his proctor he cheerfully provides the money for the wages of those who have to repair the damage never does he reflect that his recurring satiety is obtained at the cost of many others who have no such chances his habit of oxford attitudinizing is cleverly conveyed in one of the authors comments he  consoled himself for the absence of subtlety or cleverness hi such an answer by the fact that at least it was a direct statement of what he thought once during his varsity career he is shocked by the thought that he may have some direct responsibility for the death of his mothers friend who had looked to him for sympathy in his failure to woo his sister in book iv entitled  romantic education mr mackenzie secures a striking contrast by plunging his hero into the nether world of london  down  from oxford and finding himself at a loose end  common to this type of man he turns into a musichall and thore learns that the girl he had made love to six years before has become a prostitute infatuated with the power of his personality he conceives the idea that he can save her by marrying her thus securing the opportunity to make a bigger fool of himself than ever throughout the two books which comsose this volume there are many ashes of intuition as to the contemporary leniency towards hypocrisy but we doubt whether the author meant to make his hero quite so criminal a fool in his efforts to help his fellows as he will appear to those who have to combat the misspent efforts of such people the heros friend is on occasion too obviously used as a stalkinghorse to draw forth clever disquisition and so has to appear more foolish than he really is our grasp of one character at least the heros mother is strengthened in this second volume    dearest boy i ia on though committee of a society for the abatement of london street noises   so deeply occupied with reform he said patting her hand   one must do something she smiled we thank mr mackenzio for that so far as his hero is concerned we cannot sum him up any better than we did in reviewing the first volume   his failing is the lack of a guiding principle sufficiently strong to counteract the relatively cheap allurements of life if he was as is suggested received into the roman catholic priesthood that mighty organisation may have converted a waster into a useful citizen if so it was an achievement more notable than any set down yet by mr mackenzie if this delineation brings home to any their responsibility for imbuing our enemies with the idea that we are a decadent race unworthy of our christian ideals then mr mackenzie will serve a moral as well as an artistic purpose we do not however expect so much from it the author with scathing irony depicts his hero as himself resenting  life given for the sake of thousands more unworthy living comfortably at home in the writing we admire most the authors wealth and appositeness in though choice of words on the other hand some sentences are in need of revision  sinister street volume

author is he understands the lilys of this world altogether this is an arresting production a performance of literary merit  sinister street by compton mackenzie vol i martin secker 6s it may be that the dread prospect of the return of the three four or fivevolume novel determined the library censors to put their ban on this book when novels so popular as mr bennetts run into trilogies when even translations from french books such as jean christophe are published in england tetralogically messrs smith mudie and co may well have paused before committing themselves to the twovolume immensity of mr mackenzies new enterprise but these censors whose selfordained function it is to preserve the ignorance of youth have sufficient reason for banning this book if discussion of sex and sexuality is a crime any openminded reader of his novel will be convinced that mr mackenzie is attempting in a sincere and philosophic spirit to consider the supremely important effects upon character of the awakening of the sex impulse in youth this is very far from being the whole of his theme this influence is one among several supreme influences which he notes and analyses but it is a fact that he does give it a preponderance such as has probably never been assigned to it before in an english novel we welcome it as a sincere attempt to grapple with an important problem which not only every schoolmaster constantly discusses but which every headmaster in orders constantly preaches about in chapel before the whole of his school mr mackenzie happily does not preach for it is the business of a novelist not to preach but to present and to allow readers to come to any conclusion didactic or otherwise according to their fancy what we are concerned withbeing convinced that mr mackenzie has no arriere pensieis his truth to life and character he is addressing himself to a task similar to that of rolland in jean christophe and showing us the evolution of a boy who in the next volume is to become a mana boy sensitive yet masculine impressionable yet active ardent yet philosophic and brilliantin a certain sense a type and in another sense a superman or rather superboy michael hishers is the son of a mrs fane not married to that dimly shadowed father the earl of saxby michael and his sister stella are the loveproducts of this unrecognised union and both of them set out upon their exceptional yet representative careers we find it hard to be convinced by the psychology of michael the baby and small boy mr mackenzie probably resembles the rest of us in forgetting his own impressions at the age of two and in attempting to reconstruct the infantile phantasms of reality he is no more successful than he was in carnival or than m rolland was in jean christophe but no sooner has his hero gone to school than he begins to live for us as well as for himself this sinister picture of the foolish satire of masters the fashions and aspirations of small boys the keen zest for work and games and weariness of them the vast absorbing and sometimes hated institutional atmosphere of the school is a more faithful picture of publicschool life than anything we know in english fiction where mr mackenzie perhaps errs is in the emphasis he gives to certain exceptional influences in the life of his hero nearly all schoolboys are extraordinarily sentimental and extraordinarily religious but michael is a theologian many clever schoolboys are in danger of becoming aesthetes whether it be of the george moore or the oscar wilde type but michael outdoes them all nearly all of them are addicted to love affairs and take an interest in questions of sex but michael is more than most boys exposed to the violent surprises of knowledge but if mr mackenzie attends to this question very closely and actually gives it a greater importance than it seems to merit that is because he is attending very closely to all the remarkable influences which may be exerted upon an impressionable and exceptional boy we think that he has considering his whole scheme attempted a task which is rather too large for his philosophy but his characters are alive the school is a veritable hive of bees and drones we recognise it as a characteristic forcing ground of youth undoubtedly mr mackenzie has written a powerful and zestful book which the censor has advertised to the advantage of those whom he has introduced to it,unmarked
  his ladys pleasure by harold bindloss  v white  co mb bindloss is an astonishingly fluent writer his published stories succeed one another with the regularity of the four seasons this is we think to be regretted for it means that the novelists work reaches the public before he hos properly digested it himself the same remark could be applied no doubt to a great deal of current fiction every now and again however mr bindloss produces a book which indicates that he is capable of conceiving and writing a story that would be worth telling really well  his ladys pleasure is a case in point it is an excellent story of incident and adventure on the west coast of africa reminiscent in plot of stevenson and lloyd osbournes the wrecker and in scene and treatment of mr a j dawsons  in the bight of benin but mr bindloss apparently will not take the trouble to do justice to his undoubtedly lively invention and distinct feeling for the picturesque and romantic side of openair life in the wild outlying portions of the british empire,unmarked
the lovels of arden the locels of arden by the author of  lady audleys secret c c c in three volumes john maxwell aud co if there were anything more than the stringing together of unnatural and inartistic plots and the heaping of coarse drapery upon a number of stagepuppets in miss braddons novels it might be expected that in the twenty or more that she has written her literary resources would be somewhat exhausted as it is she is as fresh as ever the same puppets can be used over and over again with quite as much reason as on the first occasion and with their frequent use and constant exercise in their rearrangement comes a certain skill that makes the novels run more easily to the sort of readers who alone can take pleasure in such works as hers in many ways indeed she improves as she goes on in this latest of her productions the difficulties of english grammar are mastered the spelling of the trite french extracts is correct and the vulgarities of thought are somewhat smoothed over the ordinary materials of the sensational school too are here used very sparingly there is not so much as the mention of poisoning in the book there is not even any actual adultery in the first volume it is true miss braddons admirers will be cheered by the hope that not only will the seventh commandment be broken but that there will be incest as well but they will be disappointed at last if there is any disappointment after enjoying long chapters full of the outpourings of a mans lawless passion and the excitement of a married womans dalliance with him as far as eye and ear and mouth are concerned in finding that no actual sin has been committed and that virtue triumphs in the end miss braddons chief skill has always been shown in her mode of tickling without surfeiting the appetites of her readers and she excels in  the lovels of arden clarissa lovel the heroine is first introduced to us as a young lady of exquisite refinement and beauty just come from school who flirts with george fairfax a gentleman equally refined and beautiful during a night journey from london to yorkshire which they make in a firstclass railway carriage that has no other occupants miss lovels father of course descended from one of the oldest families in england has been brought down in the world by the extravagances of his wife who had spent his money in fascinating mr fairfaxs father and for some time we are allowed to suppose that the lovers of the second generation may be brother and sister but the errant mother and father have sinned only in thought and the errant daughter and son are to do no more their first meeting is soon followed by a long intimacy consequent on their being visitors at the same country house where also is staying lady geraldine challener to whom mr fairfax is to be married miss lovel being chosen as one of the bridesmaids after a ball preliminary to the wedding however mr fairfax takes miss lovels hand in  hi3 firm grasp and tells her that he likes her better than his betrothed and means to marry her lam not one of those saints he says in the hoarse hard voice  that is essential to such a declaration  who think of everybodys happiness before their own clarissa i am very human with all humanitys selfishness i want to be happy i want a wife for whom i can feel something more than a cold wellbred liking i did not think that it wa3 in me to feel more than that i thought i had outlived my capacity for loving wasted the strength of my hearts youth on worthless fancies spent all my patrimony of affection  but the light shines on me again and i thank my god that it is so yes clarissa come what may i thank my god that i am not so old a man in heart and feeling as i thought myself of course clarissa tries  to stem the current of his talk with her heart beating stormily but with semblance of exceeding calmness  but of course she reciprocates his passion though she seems to be in a vague way conscious that it would have been more decent for him to be formally off with the old love before he is on with the new she behaves as well as could be expected of her she refuses him  and refuses him again when the intended wedding is put off in consequence of the providential death of lady geraldines father he is mightily insulted and goes away in high dudgeon first unfolding to her his plans with an honesty that is astounding  i will stand aside and make way for a wealthier suitor says this highbred gentleman to this modest maiden  perhaps we may meet again some day and i may not be so unfortunate as my father after that the young lady is  going back to the house slowly tearless but with something like despair in her heart when she hears the orchardgate open again  he has come back perhapsreturned to forgive and pity her noit is the  wealthier suitor  who was to be made way for this person mr granger is as respectable a man as miss braddon can paint with the colours at her command it is needless to say that he is a millionaire he is also a widower with a daughter older than miss lovel miss lovel loathes him but she marries him because he and her father wish it in due time  god gives her a son she tries to be a good wife and after a little mild flirtation with mr fairfax she prays that she may not meet him again  her prayers were not grantedperhaps they did not come so entirely from the heart as prayers should that would fain bring a blessing she meets him often and he is most seductive when he appears before her in evening dress which has a sensuous meaning to miss braddon which we believe no other novelist has detected  the broad expanse of shirt front she exclaims in a sentence sufficiently eloquent though a verb is missing  with its delicate embroidery not obtrusively splendid but minutely elaborate rather involving the largest expenditure of needlework to produce the smallest and vaguest effect a suspicion of richness as it were nothing more the expanse of linen proclaims the breadth of chest and gives a factitious slimness to the waist mr fairfaxs factitious slimness overcomes mrs granger 8he confesses her love for him but refuses to run away ith him lest her son should  blush for his mother byandby  i have never found that sons have a faculty of blushing on account of that kind of thing mr fairfax answers and adds in a stage whisper  egad thered be a great deal of blushing going on at the crack clubs if they had   though mrs granger refuses to run away she does not mind talking and thinking adultery during a volumefull of clandestine interviews at last her lover by a very mean trick puts her in such a suspicious situation that her husband finding her in it insists on a separation she runs away with her baby but not with mr fairfax her baby nearly dies and her husband telegraphed for comes to help her to nurse him then she falls ill and her husband nurses her too the end of it is that mr granger says  my darling we will begin the world againwe will begin life over again clarissa   so all ends happily and mr fairfax after taking up with a spanish dancer marries a rich widow  he and clarissa meet sometimes in society meet touch hands even and know that every link between them is broken it has not been our misfortune to read all miss braddons novels but of all that we have read c the lovels of arden is the nastiest,unmarked

rzctzow life in dakecarlia the parsonage of mora by fredrika    bremer translated by william howiftt 1845 chap man and hall there can be no more pleasing task to the critic than to review a new work by miss bremer and yet the labour light and agreeable as it seems is not unattended with difficulty the charming dialogues and picturesque scenes which our authoress touches off so happily are too apt to cause him to forget the sterner portion of his duty and to overlook the great defect of these popular fictionsthe lax tone of morality pervading the majority of the series we may probably be deemed fastidious but it appears to us that too low a standard is allowed to feminine purity and thus a dark shade is cast over that otherwise beautiful story home and we fear that life in dalecarlia cannot be exempted from a similar reproach in the former novel a lady represented as moving in the higher circles of swedish life an excellent and exemplary woman but just escapes an entanglement with the tutor of her children a young man of 20 in the present tale a lady of equally admirable character loved and respected by an attached md worthy husband lives with him for years without ac luainting him with her former marriagea marriage unhap pily contracted against the advice of friends with a clever but unprincipled man whose contempt for human ordinances separates him from his wife and subjects him to the ignominy of a shameful death this man is believed dead so far the wife is justified in marrying again yet how she can live on year after year with an openhearted confiding husband keeping her own secret and yet happy seems such an anomaly that really we can neither reconcile ourselves to the fact nor the lady perhaps we might not have made this protest but for the purpose of noticing the difference existing betweenb english and swedish manners and of observing that although our own domestic life may be less romantic than that of our northern friends it is in appearance at least infinitely more moral yet how ungrateful it seems to make these remarks when we consider how much we are indebted to the howtrrs for the introduction of their booksbooks that have pictured in such bright colours the delights of homethat holy word so dear to every englishmanand that have thrown a halo around the most trivial and commonplace offices of life investing them with a charm which many must have felt but more forgotten ever existed or if remembered remembered but to ridicule and now having finished our homily let us at once start for dalecarlia where a mrs ingelborgh the wife of the pastor of mora the identical lady whose matrimonial conduct we have dared to censure assembles around her some young relations whose pursuits afford her both employment and plea sure the little party consists of two young ladies valborg and brigetta brigettas brother lieut lam mrs ingelborghs stepson olof just returned from upsala and her niece  the fifteenyear old siri  the lady herself and her husband gustaf nordevall complete the list of these siri the young and elflike siri and the heroine of the tale is one of the most beautiful creations that a modern author has conceived her childlike

ladys courserher affectionate though energetic disposition render her most engaging and centre in her the whole and undivided interest of the reader blow to introduce this fairylike being mind a german fairy not the pretty delicate elf of merrie england or the waggish imp of old ireland whether sailing on the silja  the eye of dalarna galloping wildly on the beforementioned furious brunehilda or diving for the wed ding ring of martins stina is difficult to decide perhaps her thoughtful gentle though sportive spirit may not be better displayed than in a walk with her lover and selfelected tutor olof nordevall on the banks of the silja olof gazed on the rivers playful windings on the distant mountain veiled in an azure mystic shadow and he thought on siri for that landscape with its changing physiognomy was to him as an image of the charming enigmatical maiden who continued more and more to occupy his mind his heart was now softened towards her for he called to mind her late acqui escence and her tears as he then went on and thought he began to bear delicious notes of a rute they played one of those northern melodies in which a sad seriousness is pervaded by i know not what touching innocent joy and every close has a moriendo in which the tone does not seem to terminate but to disappear like a spirit in space which goes to continue its song upon another shore deeply was olofs soul now smitten by these notes and by this holy still lifethe life of dalarnawhich he seemed to drink in from them the young man became warmed and eltvated in spirit and it seemed to him as if some deep and beautiful secret of existence was about in this moment to be revealed to him lie knew well that the siren who called forth these tones was no other than siri and be followed them in order to discover her he soon descried her where she lay in the soft grass by a verdant sepulchral mount near the riverbank wild rosebushes which in certain districts so richly adorn the margin of the dalilf budded around her and the elk durathor shook as he lay at her feet his little bells as he already at a distance heard sume one approaching sid too looked up she blushed a little at olofs presence and greeted him in a friendly manner she looked gentle but not joyous that was beautiful which you just now played  said olof did you think so  said she  then i will play more for you she played again some melodious measures and then said  do you know what these are  that is the song that the water spirit by ifusby sings at night as he sits on the rock at the waterfall above the mill the words are  and i hope and i hope that my rleleemer liveth ah i how gladly would i hear him when be sings this and he actually sits there at night and sings said olof smiling while he seated himself on a little hillock opposite to siri yes so they say answered siri hesitatingly i know well that others say that it is all superstition but then much must be superstition which is right beautiful and which sounds like truth for example tell me something more about these things said olof familiarly  for example about the cairnpeople continued siri  do you know what dwells in the cairn here  they are the cairn people for the sepulchral mount is a spirithouse and when we on a summer evening lay ourselves down beside such a mount we hear the music within they are the cairnpeople who play on their harps and sing laments over their captivity and call on men for salvation if you promise it them then they play blithely the whole night through but if you answer them you have no redeemer i  then do they dash their harps to pieces amid lamentations and remain silent in the cairn and do you know that in the springs live maidens who are very beautiful but who are captives and beneath their silver roof long for the day of judgment for then shall they be free they are dumb and look very sorrowful and roll slowly their eyes and shed large tears yes in all streams and lakes in mountain and wood are these beings found who are captive and who seek after release ah olof how do i pity all these and gladly would i liberate them i have often felt and feel it again at the present time bow hard it is to be in thraldom and only think to be so all life long  and sin stooped her face into her hands and wept  but my sweet child represented olof  all these beings over whom you grieve are the offspring of phantasythey do not exist  yes so many people say answered sin but i know nevertheless that in some way or other they do exist although i cannot explain how often when i am out alone by day or bi night i think that i will talk to all around me and that all shall talk to me and that i will get to understand about it yes i cannot tell what hinders but it seems to me often as if i am bound and need a deliverance  then should i understand every thing and be good and happy ah olof  my mind is often very strangely affected and when i see then any thing in nature which suffers or which is ruinedwhich dies then do i long to be able to help it  and it distresses me that i cannot  god knows my little sister whence you have got all these melancholy phantasies of nature i think that all in nature is glorious and perfect  yes sometimes it does seem so  but i have seen deeper into it and there is much that is evil and repulsive i have seen how all is devouredall

to demand more than eight days to go through all its rooms as far as the territory of terra nova and the region of whereto which extends two hundred fathoms deep below the bottom of the mine the various and picturesque names of these rooms and halls gathered out of all periods of history out of the kingdoms of both fancy and reality contribute to give to the place a romantic interest for the imagination almost all the kings and queens of sweden have paid viits to this mine charles ix whose heart seemed to have much of the nature and character of a mountain except for the tender wonan his first beloved wife in honour of whom he founded and narned the towns  smariefred and mariestad charles ix was extremely attached to thisi mining country was often residing there and called the mine  swedens fortune and desired that the great room there might be called the room of gods gifts his great son gustavus adolphus also exclaimed as he stood in one of the rooms of the mine when the bright copper ore beamed from the walls roof and door w where is the monarch who has such a palace as that in which we now are  but notwithstanding all this siri did not find here the palaces the magnificent underworld of which she had dreamed to herself and whose names the jewel the crown the sceptre c seemed to promise there were perpetually the same dark vaulted passages the same great empty balls and domes exca vations and shafts or sinkings out of which eternal night seemed to stare upon you there was everywhere the same damp cold air the same dripping and dropping from above and which rendered the floor slippery the sides of the mine glittered indeed when the torches shone upon them or when they were struck against them and sent forth showers of sparks and the stalactites glimmered also as they hung above on the arched roofs but it was a chill and colourless gleam wlich left soul and sense cold in the passages the miners frequently were met with torches in their hands in their black dresses with solemn pale grimy countenances and slow and heavy steps the life in the mine did not seem to be joyous and at every glance sirns eyes grew darker and her heart more oppressed she would not have been astonished if she now had been told that the most melancholy of mortal ailments insanity was one of the most prevalent amongst the labourers of this subterranean kingdom for such a highminded and romantic creature as siri marriage of course would have been too commonplace accordingly we find her at the conclusion of the tale following the course pointed out to her by her father the misguided but enthusiastic julius wolff the former husband of mrs ingelborgh whose discovery and death terminate the story we cannot better conclude than with his wordsi dedicate thee to a life in which daily joys and daily sorrows will be counted of little value but where the smallest of them will serve the most high i consecrate thee to a work of peace and beauty thy days to a still creations

new novels one immortality by h fielding hall macmillan  co mr fielding hall has chosen the form of a novel for his latest reflections on the philosophy of life the reader will find however no plot and no action in the story  the characters who are fellowtravellers on the voyage from venice to india are only brought together to give expression to the authors theories concerning love and marriage the difference between east and west and kindred matters the group consists of two married couplesone happy and the other unhappy  some nuns  an indian girl and her european admirers  a delightful german professor and two englishmen one of whom holt a dreamy mystical person engages in a prolonged and laboured though ultimately successful courtship of an english girl who is also of the party they all move in an atmosphere of divine discontent and selfanalysis and the language which they employ in conversation is not suitable for ordinary usage but mr fielding hall is a poet in feeling and if on this occasion he is disappointing as an exponent of the east to the west there is beauty both in his ideas and his expression of them  olne imzmortality by h fielding hall macmillan 6s we have had occasion to praise mr fielding halls work before now in these columns and his new novel if such we can term it attains a high level in a style which he has previously used with good effect the short crisp sentences give a peculiar impression of strength especially in the pages here and there which are devoted to descriptive matter but as to story there is very little of it the book is to all intents and purposes a philosophical disquisition on the themes of love and marriage and the characters introduced are mere figures throuh whose lips as by ventriloquism certain views are set forth we hasten to add that there is nothing irrational or displeasing about these views at the same time with all due respect to the author it must be admitted that they become a trifle prosy and boring these worthy people of his who toss the ball of intellectual conversation to and fro so neatly they meet at venice and by the time the steamer on which they depart has reached bombay the story is finished a girl who seeks for the meaning of her existence of life of love is drawn sympatheticallv to one of the other passengers a young man who is also somewhat misty as to the reason of flis being and his ultimate destinv our readers can easily guess the natural conclusion of such a situation it is in the descriptive passages that we like the author best one or two brief extracts will show his power one day they came on deck to find the ship was motionless her engines had broken down and so she lay like some great wounded thing upon the sea a light wind blew and the little waves came racing up to see her wondering what was this black and ugly thing that lay so still    they raised their heads to look at her they laughed they splashed their spray upon her in derision and then they danced away gaily joyfully singing their ocean song and glancing back in mockery over their lucent shoulders at the uncanny monster above the northern horizon hung a peak suspended in the heavens you could not see its base the purple haze was folded over it and hid it but in the clear sky above the sharp rocksummit stood revealed in clearest outline the golden sunlight fell upon it like a glory and upon its shoulders fields of purest snow shone like a womans skin gleaming through openings of her drapery the ship passed very slowly through the narrow water before her it stretched a ghastly greenish strip lit by her searchlight the buoys that marked the deeper water swam suddenly into being when the light touched them and disappeared behind her into the night on either side there was a wave that followed the ship washing against the banks with a dull murmur and beyond the banks of the desert it seemed to stretch into illimitable distances mysterious wonderful in the dim light of a half moon strange noises came from it a jackal barked with mournful cadence a camel bubbled and there were sounds born of the night alone whispers and sighs that drifted up on the night wind it seemed as if they were the deserts thoughts that passed her dreams her fancies her remembrances they were the ghosts of all the things that she had seen through all the ages such choosing of words is excellent and reminds us of some of the strikingly effective language in a previous book of mr halls  the soul of a people our readers who do not mind pleasant discursions on a wellworn theme often very pertinent and stimulating to thought may enjoy this novel but those who anticipate a story will be we fear a little disappointed,unmarked

the other iiousy by henry james heine mann the other house is conceived in a purely dramatic spirit and worked out with a scrupulous regard for the conventions and limitations of the theatre who runs may    see that it not only contains dramatic situations but is a play in all save name and externals instead of acts it is divided into three books  everything in it suggests the stage  so that point on the authority of the saturday review the athenaeum and the bookman may be taken as settled and in determining upon its actual form the athenaeum thinks mr henry james has chosen the better partthat he has saved much that is supremely delicate in touch much that shows the most sensitive care for the right distribution of light and shade and many fine distinctions in tones and manners which would have lost focus and significance in the glare of the footlights from possible misapprehension and misinterpretation the writer of the very able article which the saturday devotes to the work discerns in it the assumption of a second manner in this dramatic method of construction however he points out the obvious drawback that  there is room for very little of the daintily whimsical commentary upon his characters their looks and thoughts and motives and amiable absurdities which he knows how to make so delightful also the same critic finds the cultivated indirection of the authors style less appropriate when it is merely a question of supplying the physical links in a chain of earnest and momentous dialogue the morning post finds in the book a breaking down of that aloofness which hitherto has stood between mr jamess readers and any warmer feeling than genuine admiration the present novel is forcible and passionate  1 the other souse new novels by henry james 2 vols heinemann ho runs should yet possibly may not read between the lines in mr jamess new novelmay not see that it not only contains dramatic situations but is a play in all save name and externals instead of acts it is divided into three books and the interest continues to deepen steadily till the final crisis it reads as though the author had at first conceived it in no other light than a play but had afterwards as it were recoiled from the ineptitudes and vulgarities that on the stage are often the ruin of the best dialogue action and incident considering the state of the drama in spite of many important improvements we cannot blame him for eschewing the ordeal in leaving  the other house as a very notable and distinguished piece of work he may even be congratulated on having chosen the better part those who best know mr jamess qualities and the shortcomings of theatrical impersonation may agree that he has not improbably saved much that is supremely delicate in touch much that shows the most sensitive care for the right distribution of light and shade and many fine distinctions in tones and manners which would have lost focus and significance in the glare of the footlights from possible misapprehension and misinterpretation short of being actually witnessed with the bodily eyesight the other house by the skilful arrangement of its events and figures should become by a mental adjustment on the part of readers equivalent to a dramatic performance in it mr james has actually touched the heart of life more closely and more persistently than in his recent works where the action sweeps relentlessly forward to the tragic conclusion which on this occasion he makes no attempt to blinkthere can be but few digressions and hesitations quiet and restrained as are almost all the scenes the thing palpitates with the emotion belonging to a work of art that has been cost and fused in one supreme effort mr james has abandoned his ordinary method of working about and around an idea his actors by their every word and gesture advance instead of retarding the action and interest there are three men three women and a child  though last a most important though passive instrument in their hands on this child hinge directly or indirectly the fates of the rest of the group the first book contains as it were the prologue and subtly suggests the coming clash of interests and affections a necessary interval of a few years does not interfere with the sense of unity in the piece the second book again discovers the same characters in the same place under slightly altered conditions hut intensified and dominated by the same impulses in the third the catastrophe and its consequences untie the knot and scatter the actors we have said that it is a story of human interest and passion but at the same time we may add that a feeling of artificiality is present in the play of repartee the verbal parryings the purposes and cross purposes mr james has been very ingenious very admirable in the intensity he has thrown into many of the scenes and situations it is a grim drama indeed that in spite of this masquerading is played out in the small provincial town the end of the child the fashion of its taking off is horribly realistic more obscure and less tangible are the workings of rose armigers mind and yet in a manner but too clear and definite  novel notes the other house by henry james 2 vois heinemann had mr james the idea of making this story into one of his charming plays  everything in it suggests the stage or rather his own methods of playwriting in the first volume the actors seem to move to and fro to speak and refrain from speaking in accordance with laws which are not those recognised by fiction we seem to look and listen rather than read we are puzzled and go on hoping for the enlightenment of the next act rather than go back for suggestions we have missed the scene in the dcing wifes room which we only know by the reports of the doctor and the agitated but not alarmed husband moving now within to her and now out to us gives us exactly the feeling of the stage so does the dramatic reappearance of dennis vidal the treatment is novel and by its very artificiality it keeps us on the alert and yet we doubt if any reader will guess quite accurately the conclusion no one would venture to think mr james would lead up to an obvious end yet the story has rather an obvious end only with highly original circumstances it ends in a tragedya very ugly tragedy everything was tending to it but we thought mr jamess fastidiousness would avoid it but no he merely avoids the scandal attaching to it there is only one character that is dull and ineffective but she is kept so purposely that though we may guess at her slumbering passions we may not know the dark possibilities which are to flash out in crime the others are perfectly conceived and developed especially that clever and admirable british matron mrs beever and the subtle the exaggerated the charming tony with his  dashed sociability  and his unconscious power of drawing womens love like mr james himself we are inclined to huddle away the terrible last act and dwell on the tragicomedy that is played so cleverly till near the end  the other house by henry james in 2 vols heinemann after a considerable interval devoted to experiments in other forms of imaginative literature though short story and the play mr henry james gives us a new novel we can but open it in some trepidation will devouring time have robbed nothing of the keen psychology the subtle portraiture the cunning evolution that have delighted us so often a very early scene dispels such a fear the sweet roman hand is at work in the first interview between rose armiger and dennis vidal with its delicate swordplay its exquisite indication of crosspurposes and the clash of standpoints like mr meredith mr james hos always before him the problem of rendering through the medium of mere words more than the mere words of a diologue to put its very intonation the atmosphere of it on the pagthis is the ideal which he often comes so near achieving like mr meredith and yet with how greot a difference os a rule in the solution but is it a mere fancy to perceive in the present novel the influence of the one living master of english fiction who could have taught anything to mr james  do not some flashes of meredithian intensity break the unruffled lucid calm of mr jamess familiar manner does not tony bream owe something in conception at least to victor durance the other howe compels admiration but it also strongly compels protestthe very protest itself perhaps only another tribute to the vitality and persuasiveness of mr jamess puppets but surely in the figure of rose anniger subtlety hos been pushed beyond the borders of enigma wo oro accustomed to the impassive masks of mr jamess heroines when we get though keynote the inexplicabilities generally arrange themselves into a sufficiently logical whole but we submit that in rose armiger the burden of interpretation laid upon the reader is too heavy for him to beor it is to make bricks without straw even after the denouement going back over the earlier scenes with perhaps more patient analysis than a novel may fairly claim we are still unable at certain points to see what in homely phrase the woman is driving at there is one passage which we can only make intelligible to ourselves by the somewhat bold process of emending the text we should be gratified to mr james if he would tell us whether we ought not on the eighth line from the bottom of p 196 of vol ii to read hate her  for take her of course the change inverts the meaning of the sentence it is possibly because we frankly find rose armiger such a puzzle that the denouement itself with its sudden revelation of the resourceful triumphal woman as a criminal of an especially revolting and not even very plausible kind fails to convince us almost offends us we cry out against it it could not be so  we feel that mr james had no right to enlist our sympathies even in error for the woman  to give us no hint and then at the end to submit us to such outrage we close the book with something of emotional disturbance as well as of intellectual perplexity but it is an astonishingly clever and interesting book for all that,unmarked

cosines would wink at us solemnly with a merry twinkle and isosceles triangles would skip before our eyes like the little hills of the hebrew psalmist his first story  the end of phaeacia introduces us to a missionary of the bungletonian connexion the boanerges of the pacific who lights in the course of his evangelistic wanderings on the last surviving specimen of a greek community and describes the manners and customs of these benighted heathens as an officer of the salvation army might naturally be expected to describe them in this case i cannot help thinking mr lang has allowed his archaeological knowledge to run away with himn i have never been accned of an excessive regard for missionary effort  but if the customs of phaeacia were at all as he paints them i confess that the rev thomas gowles hlis my sincerest sympathy the tharelia seem to have been a very unpleasant ceremony indeed and any man even if not a boanergvs might reasonably object to being first floged and then slowly roasted to death over a lingering fire my love for the greeks has never been strong since i escaped alive fromu aeschylus and plato and mr lang has suecceeded in finally convincing me that the

faithful of islam its theological implications impress an anxious mind as verging on heterodoxy  the romance of the first radical strikes at the very roots of society and religion for it sets forth the appalling and revolutionary doctrine that  a thing is not necessarily wrong because the medicine men say so and the tribe believes them if such ideas are scattered abroad no security will remain for the deepest and most sacred convictions of our nature whywhy too is more in advance of his age than any single radical can ever be even mr lang himself lets us see in this very volume that he objects to home rule believes in the sacred right of somebody to taboo a whole shire and regards nonpayment of rent to a landlord as a culpable breach of the eighth commandment  the great gladstone myth is a variation on an old and wellworn theme but so cleverly handled that one reads it all with an unbroken sense of perfect novelty i am glad mr lang seems to admit that there may be something in

they sparkle with wit and abound in the finest undertones of irony if we regard them as light contributions to anthropology and mythology they are rich in pregnant hints of real value and cut some

sir goodings folly a story of the year 1795 by arthur locker 3 vols chap man cc hall about the year 1795 if reliance may be placed on mr locker there lived in york street st jamess a lady whose beauty brought round hera crowd of admirers and whose past history and her mode of life were a source of gossip to fashionable people dwelling in the neighbourhood of the court that she was lovely no one denied that she was much sought after was a fact well known to the chairmen of the court district artd the loungers of whites and boodles that she deserved her popularity was a question which grave and pious persons answered stoutly in the negative lier face and form caused her to be pointed at in the parks as a truthful reproduction of the princess de lamballe in the heyday of her loveliness but the ladys personal charms were not the only attractions which nightly filled her drawingrooms it was not unusual for indigent women of fashion in the last century to keep private gamblingtables at which guests were expected to render homage to chance and beauty at the same time to good people of this generation it may seem scarcely credible that little more than halfacentury since ladies could be proprietors of drawingroom  hells and yet be countenanced by people of good repute such however was the case when george the third was still a vigorous king when adverse fortune compelled a woman of tonne to shift for herself if she had the requisite knowledge of the world and a connexion with people of the right sort she would open a farotable and look for the support of her old associates in her new calling just as a reduced lady nowadays would seek the aid of friends in an attempt to establish a fashionable boardingschool or in endeavours to place herself in any other honest vocation of the many ladies who thus fought the battle of life at the close of the last century none was more admired or talked about than mrs norland of york street a pleasant mystery surrounded the lady it was rumoured that she was the daughter of a village schoolmaster had in girlhood figured amongst the frail beauties of the palais royal had enjoyed the friendship of philippe galite and as the wife of a certain major norland1 had passed some years in india nabobs whispered that major norland had disappeared mysteriously from his post in british india leaving his wife to shift for herself whether the major was still living no one knew  but for all practical purposes mrs norland was a widowfree to please herself alone in accepting and returning the flatteries of many lovers and in no way restrained by considerations of wifely duty mr locker has placed this character on his canvas with great skill the doubts and scandal of her past life aud the temptations surrounding her career as the keeper of a fashionable gamblinghouse neither cause others to speak of her with angry censure nor make her forgetful of selfrespect in spite of baneful educatkm and a demoralising occupation she is a womanly and rightminded creature lovers seek her hand but she keeps them at a distance evening after evening she entertains her patrons and patronesses  displaying a pair of lovely arms and delicatelyshaped hands as she turns up the cards whilst  her face is invisible hidden behind an envious blue domino and it is an affair of conjecture amongst her supporters why she does not yield to one of her many rich suitors and become the wife of a wealthy husband instead of persisting in the exercise of a precarious business amongst her more ardent admirers is sir goodwin anerleya rich baronet who having been a courtier in his youth is at sixty years of age the head of a great commercial house in the city a widower with two charming daughters whose love affairs form an important part of the story prosperous and honoured the stately baronet who is an excellent type of the london gentleman of a hundred years ago falls madly in love with the siren of york street according to the fashion of the day he addresses her in language of fanciful sentimentality but his passion is pure and loyal this is sir goodwins folly the old man loves as young men only ought to love madly and without regard to prudence from the moment when the baronet and the lady are brought together the interest of the story turns on the question will they marry i and this interest is cleverly maintained till the close of the third volume the positions of the lover and amanda are constantly being changed and the readers anxiety to know the end of the wooing is heightened by each change of circumstances all that relates to this main current of the tale mr locker has managed excellently frederick starlinghurst the welldescendedrowis a personagewho eouldnot have been portrayed by a writer not conversant with the world of existing society as well as with the life of george the thirds town the baronets daughters are excellently drawn and their prim severe but kindhearted governess is an original creation ably also haa the author caught the political spirit of the churchandstate men and of the disaffected classes the costume manners and amusements of the period are in like manner set forth with no ordinary power the painstaking fidelity of the artist being apparent in the social descriptions although he never burdens his pages with extracts from his notebook the story however has important faults and blemishes which it would be wrong to pass without notice instead of confining himself to the history of sir goodwins folly which affords ample material for three volumes of writing mr locker has crowded his scenes with characters and having brought them on the stage has with wearisome conscientiousness expended labour in making them say and do much that in no way promotes the action of the drama young beginners observed haydon of artstudents are apt to intrude all  they know not considering that the first requi  site is to please the eye through the eye  a  mnltiplicity of parts

way i peculiarly susceptible of treatment by writers  for the stageand avoided superabundant j characters and burdensome digressions we j should have spoken of his novel in higher j terms as it stands however sir goodwin folly belongs to the superior grade of prose fiction and we lay it aside with a feeling that its writer may produce a better book  sir goodwins folly in this story mr locker occupies ground which although not wholly new to the writer of fiction has perhaps been made less use of than we might have expected the period of the french revolution and the fearful and sanguinary events connected with it have it is true formed the staple of nmany french stories and as in mr dickenss  tale of two cities found a way into english fiction but the agitation caused by that mighty event in england though of an infinitely milder character the outer ripples of the surface of society here caused by the casting of that modem babylon the capital of france into the sea of revolutionary outrage which nevertheless inaugurated a new epoch of european progresshave never been very enmphatically noted by writers of this class on our own side of the channel the matter may possibly have been thought hitherto more pertinent to the province of the historian than the novelist but in its social aspect it is manifestly not wholly unadapted to the purposes of the latter mr locker impressed as it appears with this view opens his narrative in the midst of the period referred to in 1795 when among certain sections of the people in this country and certain political circles most unmistakeable signs were evinced of a tendency to fraternise with revolutionary france but these circles and parties were of two very distinct characters while one undoubtedly such as that headed by fox and other distinguished public men applauded loyally the principles upon which the revolution was commenced another in a lower stratum of society was prepared to go to almost any length in admiring advocating and even adopting the practises of the revolutionists between these might probably be reckoned a third class represented by such men as horn tooke thelwall and other members of the london corresponding society who to a respectable station and intelligence united a more intimate knowledge of and sympathy with the classes below them both in their wrongs and sufferings despite indeed the ferocious loyalty which surrounded the throne ad ostentatiously displayed itself in the house of commons and the squirearchy in general so deep was the discontent caused by the political

teaching calmness and patience the hotel royal where the men and women of this story live during the months in which we learn to know them is a real place no reader will doubt it we know its rooms with the sunshine on the windows its balcony with the row of chaises loxgues its stairs with babette toiling up and down and in this snowy valley and this homelike hotel we see a group of men and women fulfilling their destiny music abd harmony are in the book from end to end and the most dominant themes the most resonant insistent notes are courage and love which are greater powers than death and life such phrases as d the bells on the horses tossed the silence in little drifts about their heads such overfantastic phrases displease occasionally and are to be deplored but the book itself is not fantastic in style it is indeed singularly free from complexities and obscurities it contains wise and leautiful writing and is in spite of or because of its deeps and eddies as clear melodious and refreshing as a mountain stream  the valley of the great shadow new novels by annie e holdsworth heinemann mrs leehamiltons latest contribution does not err on the side of cheerfulness it is almost as lively as the chronicles of a workhouse infirmary  the valley of the great shadow to which the titlo rofers is one of those health resorts for consumptives in the eastern alps with which a popular work of fiction by miss harraden has taught novelreaders some familiarity mrs leehamilton seems to have become profoundly impressed with the curious combination of lungdisease and lovemaking we have not carefully enumerated the cases of engagements to marry and of deaths from chest complaints they alternate throughout the book and the leading medical man is not exempt for some reason or other the clerical element is not represented in the dramatis persona there is a disagreeable man who says  if a woman is not a fool she is a liar and if she is neither she is a confounded nuisance he too suffers ultimately from one of the two prevailing complaints there is a plainspeaking young american lady who is described as coming from kansas though she appears to have more affinity for philadelphia and there is an impossible or abnormal child which serves no good purpose in the story on the whole the volume is hardly equal to others by the same hand such as the gods arrive or  the years that the locust hath eaten though experience has added facility to the writers style  the valley of the great shadow by annie e holdsworth mrs leehamilton heinemann 6s an alpine health resort populated by doomed consumptives is necessarily rich in pathos yet one must complain that mrs leehamilton exacts too much tribute of it frankly we do not believe in the genius who was belated in a threemile walk with a child of six and perished of his fatigue in carrying her through a snowstorm nor are we impressed when miss blake attempts to toboggan out of this world because she is hurt in her selfrespect and disappointed in her affections and then when we are asked to weep over what may be called  dodo pathosthe giddy mother and the sick child  curtain  we loose our patience for be it remarked that the author does not work up as she might have done a supreme pathos out of the normal conditions of such a place as 4 mittonplatz she sugars her book through and through with detached anecdotes of artful pathos pathos of the boards life is not enough for mrs leehamilton though she spells it frequently with a capital l at the same time here is a woman who can both write and feel moreover she can paint character pass by her intense  types which are chokefull of her emotions and there is much to reward you yes there are smiles even in the valley of the great shadow and the end is really surprisingly cheerful,unmarked
the green mowue by robert w cham i bers appleton co t1m story is frankly and we think unusually extravagant for mr chambers though his work in fiction has changed greatly in the last decade having fallen more and more under the influence of new york life the present book contains sixteen chapters which many will regard as separate stories they all hinge upon a young mans invention of a machine which enables him to deal with  psychic waves  as wireless telegraphy deals with other waves with this machine a man can at once bring himself into relation with his affinity of the other sex as treated here the idea proves a happy one for a short story but it cannot bear the weight of three hundred pages the decline sets in somewhere before the hundredth page and amounts to a fall by the time we have reached p 188 but the first fifty pages are really excellent fooling in a rather stilted preface the author professes to regard his book as  moral literary and highly scientific work thinly but ineffectually disguised as fiction but the book is much better than its preface,unmarked
the cedar star by mary e mann hutchin son  co the story owning this pretty name contains positive qualities none too apparent in the common run of novels with a conspicuous absence of the more obvious faults that seem inseparable from such writing which is a way of saying that miss manns volume does not fall into the list of mediocre work yet there are inferior passages scarcely to be expected of one who in such a book as  susannah showed a happy sense of proportion and of the general fitness of things the material of susannah was handled with even greater freshness and discrimination and the amount of humour and original observation was also in excess of anything found here still there is much to be thankful for in the cedar star of the early days of the rectory children we have nothing but good to say this part of though story is artistic in the right sense of the word the children aro delightful and certainly give the impression of having been taken on the quick the gifted people who know how to reproduce the curious phases the nothings that are everything in the glory and the dream of childhood are rare indeed but fortunately not increasingly rare who reads may note some recent examples of the powor and in the cedar star there are proofs that miss mann belongs to the strictly limited company the three childrenbetty emily and jan but especially bettywith their troublesome behaviour quaint pastimes and shrewd remarks and their lovingkindness to the lower creation are if not exactly of the kingdom of heaven of the kingdom of real childhood they are at least a wellindividualized and lifelike trio their brother the insectloving peter is not so clearly focussed but though surroundings of the motherless children their passively selfish yet affectionate father the pets of the establishment the quarrels reconciliations animosities friendships and especially the conversations have all the charm of mingled divination and experience there is something about the ungoverned yet lovable ways of the little people that makes them at once amusing and pathetic the excellent caroline their fathers second wife and the sister of their staunch friend and ally the rev bill carlyon is the portrait rather than the caricature of a typical englishwoman the wellordered routine in which the poor lady is anxious to involve the young jervoises who have run wild under inefficient governesses and servants is of course little appreciated by the victims bill carlyon always indulgent to the whims of his adorers and tormentors is placed in difficult situations yet his stalwart honesty and real kindness stand him in good stead there is a certain conventionality of treatment in this muscular christian but he is very likable in spite of it the villain of the piece is not exactly overstrained still where the rest are distinctly in the picture he strikes one as being now and again a good deal out of it the beginning of the book is most decidedly the best of it bettys womanhood is far less attractive than her childhood though though author has been clever in evolving her on the same lines sundry episodes towards the close are too melodramatic to suit the note struck at the beginning but the real human nature and the clever expression of it are very noticeable points  the cedar star by mary e m 6i hutchiaon when a book is all about one person its interest naturally depends entirely upon what kind of person that one is this book is all about bettyit might be called 1 the betty book and betty is undeniably interesting she is unconventional to a degree and therefore as a child delightful unconventionality in a grown woman is less admirable and leads to situations which are neither artistically elegant nor morally inspiring and the grownup betty is disappointing but as a child she is entirely satisfactory all the more so that she is persistently the reverse to her governesses her stepmother and all other tiresome people with wellregulated minds betty had a curious and rare habit of looking things straight in the eye for herself regardless of canon and of acting and speaking directly from the conviction so reached regardless of convention the world was her oyster and she chose to open it without any ingenious patent tool picked up secondhand at the nearest ideamongers though she tore her feminine fingers sorely

offer speaking a language is a very different thing from teaching it and i have never taught he said these last words in a tone of apology for himself or his patrons or both when his head grew tired

realmah by the author of  friends in council two vols london macmillan and co 168 tine story from which these volumes have taken their name is probably of too dry and quaint a flavour to fascinate any but a select few but the dialogue that takes its turn with the story ought to bo held excellent by all men it has faults its playfulness is now and then a little forced and in order to mark their individuality the interlocutors or some of them are a little apt to overdo themselves but the general effect is very gracious and nothing could be better than the thoughtfulness which the writer brings to matters of conduct and character that are as a rule unhappily believed to be hardly worthy of thoughtfulness the age suffers from a superfluity of minor moralists it is beyond question however that the author of realmah in fineness of tone and mild sagacity is the best of them all if the indolent reader will skip the actual story of realmah himself he will find nothing but what is both lively and very salutary  bealmah kew novels by the author of  friends in conn i eil 2 vols macmillan  co  realmah has a thousand virtues mixed with a single fault there are many wise and pleasant observations a humane and generous mode of judging both persons and things thereis a great deal of ingenuity which deserved a better fate but the fact remains inexorablerealmah is dull all the virtues in the world cannot prevail in mitigation of that judgment one virtue will not do the work of another  realmah is a political romance the scene of which is laid in one of those lake villages submerged only sir charles lyell can tell us how many thousands of years ago it was however somewhere towards the close of the stone period for realmah the hero the king the lawgiver and all but the prophet of his age and nation discovers iron in the dominions of the sheviriand is inspired with the method of smelting it thereby putting his countrymen on an equality with their great enemies the tribes of the north who already possessed iron weapons realmahs ideas upon warlike matters and his mode of conducting battles and sieges resemble advanced opinions of the present day realmah is a profound politician and he might have sat at the feet of mr bright so much are his views of peace arbitration and disarmament in accordance with that orators though closing act of realmahs life is to persuade his people in an eloquent speech to dismantle their great ravala mamcethe policy he advocates is to forswear war and settle their disputes by international arbitration realmah is an imaginary eortrait of a perfectly wise and great king and e seems to be a combination of the emperor napoleon the king of prussia and count bis j mark with a few heroic virtues of his own   he is also a great orator as to the manners j and customs of the sheviri we do not know  whether it is in deference to the very easy state  of their civilization or whether it is the ideal  of domestic life as it might be but mr helps j allows all the great men of the nation to have i three wivesone the varnab or state wife pro j vided for the man by his friends and relations   the next the ainah or slave wife taken from a lower rank and chosen by lot and the third the love wife which he was allowed to choose for himself in realraahs case the three wives work harmon iously together it is the poor ainah whom he loves though she distresses his sensitive ear by mispronouncing her words but though ainah is a very sweet character and the account of her death is touching mr helps has bestowed much trouble in giving an appearance of truth to his story by inventing a language for his lake people of which he supplies a rather copious vocabulary also he gives os many of their proverbs which though far beyond tupper are not quite equal to those of king solomon the history of how realmah became king his war his policy his successes and his sorrows are set forth and fully written in this book of the chronicles of the sheviri the book is supposed to be read to our old  friends in council older than when we last met them who are assembled for a long holiday at worthashton the residence of milverton who is the author and inventor of  realmah the reading is interrupted and illustrated by comments discussions and disquisitions such as the  friends in council have rendered familiar they criticise each other and the author and the story with the freedom of men who have so real and deep an affection for each other that they can stand the very plainest of speech the two wives lady ellesmere and mrs milverton are a pleasant variety to the masculine element in the company the best feature in the book the one in which the reader can take thorough pleasure is that in every page he is in the society of persons who have a true and noble reverence for each other  realmah itself may grow tedious being full of abstract politics a didactic exposition of the ideas and theories of mr helps but the sense of the honour the worth and the friendliness of the friends assembled is an element that redeems not only the story but their somewhat prolix conversation there are excellent suggestions in milvertons essay on the art of making men comfortable perhaps in time comfort will be recognised as one of the objects of life but that will involve changes not only in the condition of material things but in the religion and philosophy of mankind we doubt whether a great nation could ever be a nation of comfortable people  the main element of comfort is living thoroughly at ease and quiet and if everybody were made comfortable who would be left to take any trouble to reform the world and improve our neighbours  there is one pleasure in reading  realmahthe

great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy

  the divinations of kala persad by headon hill ward lock and bowden mr poignand a young gentleman of limited income no profession and few talents deceived himself into thinking himself possessed of latent powers for the detection of crime he seems almost invariably to have gone on the wrong scent but like many another stupid man he had the knack of finding better endowed persons to do his work for him so he furnished a handsome office interviewed aristocratic clients looked mysteriously wise when professionally in their presence behaved agreeably in luxurious country houses and gained a great reputation for astuteness all by the divinations of a poor hindoo kala persad who was kept in the background the orientals advice was called for in really interesting cases but the stories have one defect a reader of ordinary sharpness invariably detects the criminal if not the manner and motive of the crime as soon even as kala he makes none of poignands mistakes and this has a tendency to make him conceited a writer should beware of puffing up his readers pride the tales of which kala is not the hero are better in this important respect the best of all is  a blind clue an unusual and welcome confession of how a detective failed,unmarked

she died upon the verge of womanhood cut off in the very springtiae of her beauty and of her intelligence how great a loss the world sustained is seen now in the succession of posthumous works which her sorrowing friends have published which she with the modesty of genius supposed to be unfit for the public eye because they did not come up to her own ideal standard of excellence but the welcome that has been given to all of them and their undoubted merit shows us what she would have been had it been the will of providence that her genius should ripen to maturity god however thought otherwise and took her pure and holy spirit to himself the daysof bruce is another of her fictions a composition of her early youth but full of beauty her purpose in this story is to depict and develop the character of woman in vamious situations of trial in isabella of buchan we have a picture of a heart wounded in its affections but trustful and hopeful in its misery in isoline the selfinflicted unhappiness of a too confident and selfreliant nature and in agnes  the overwhelming of a mind too much akin to heaven in purity and innocence to battle with the sorrows that beset her path of life guacie aguilan knew the female heart better than any writer of our day and in every fiction from her pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of the motives and feelings of womans nature the days of bruce possesses also the attractions of an extremely interesting story that absorbs the attention and never suffers it to flaz till the last page is closed and then the reader will lay down the volume with regret mrs nehtox crotand better known perhaps as caiiilla toomxin states in her preface to lydia a womans book that her design was to depict certain phases of life  from a womans point of view and that in doing so she has sought chiefly the approval and sympathy of her own sex the story like all of mrs croslands productions has a wholesome moral not preached however but shown a lesson which the reader learns without the appearance of learning conclusions which he draws for himself with the pleasurable consciousness of selfinstruction this is a groat art in fiction known only to the better class of writers and were we find it we mav be sure that we have passed out of the region of commonplace and are in the company of an author not of a mere scribbler and pretender to authorship mrs cnoslands lydia is an exquisite portrait of a true woman the story is thoroughly rational and probable but never dull she possesses indeed the rare faculty of creating an interest in ordinary things and persons by the charm of her descriptions in short she is an artist  her books are works of art carefully designed conscientiously composed corrected with care having an aim and a plan and therefore not only delighting readers of all classes but commending themselves to the intellectual who desire in a book something more than a mere pastime who rquire it to be like a

the bandolero or a marriaae amona the moun tains by capt main reid bentley although capt main reid has written some good books for boys and we of maturer age have been able to take interest in the stirring adventures which were not intended for us we must confess that the present work whether written for boys men or women is a lamentable failure plot and incidents are of the stalest description the story consists of various attempts at murder and one or two attempts at marriage there is a young american who sees a mexican lady on her balcony and falls desperately in love with her there is a young mexican who is in love with a lady living in the same house and appearing on the same balcony the american is alternately jealous of the mexican and his most devoted friend while the attempts at murder alternate with much the same regularity as the swing of a pendulum first the mexican saves the american then the american saves the mexican  and then in the act of saving the american the mexican is saved by him similarly the american first mistakes his loves sister for his love then he mistakes bis love for her sister and then he mistakes his love for herself like the traditional irishman who ended by finding it was neither of us capt main reids only excuse is that the reader is quite as much puzzled as the hero could have been the reader can never make out why the young american should always mistake the two sisters just when it was the authors interest to prolong the story and the conclusion is so abrupt that the reader does not know whether the mystery is solved at last and whether the american and mexican get the right ladies capt main reid reminds us of the clergyman who married several couples at once and then finding he had not been so particular in sorting them as they could have wished told them to make it all right among them yet wear doing injustice to capt main reids wonderful powers of language in comparing him to an english clergyman the quantity of spanish phrases scattered over the volume would alone qualify the gallant captain for a consulship in spain or a professorship at oxford no civil service commissioner could resist the tide of queridos and ranchos and bandoleros and salteadores and va mos aud pesos and puentes and pordios and vs nor would the effect on oxford be less strikiug we feel confident that the professor of greek would throw his arms wide open to embrace a caudidate who had beeu soured by meeting with a heartless flirt and who proclaimed himself  almost a gynothrojie this astonishing effort of constructive philology is to be found at p 88 of  the bandolero to which we refer any readers who may doubt our veracity capt main reid almost deserves to be canonised for inventing such a word,unmarked

1 the doctors wife ts new novels by the author of lady audleys secretc 3 vols maxwell  co in the october of 1862 we noticed lady audley  secret and in october 1864 we are about to review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his mistress the interview between the lovers is intended to be most pathetic the widow whose husband lies unburied assuring mr lansdell that he has no need to ask her forgiveness and mr lansdell commending the lady to the protection of his family mr lansdell dies penitent leaving the bulk of his vast property to isabel and his murderer escapes to america thus freed from her plebeian husband

the dwale bluth hebditchs legacy and other literary remains of oliver madoxbrown author of  gabriel denver edited by w m rossetti and f hueffer london tinsley brothers 1876 the results of the brief literary life of the author of gabriel denver illustrate one not uncommon phenomenon while they are an exception to another the son of an historical painter this wondrous boy for he was but twenty when he died was an instance of the not unfrequent union of pictorial talent with rare gifts of literary description precocious as a child he had never say his biographers up to the time of his death  so much as left for many weeks together the shelter of his paternal roof only for a couple of years before he entered his teens does he seem to have attended even a dayschool yet his work exhibits a lively negative to the saw that homekeeping youths have ever homely wits  and whether we examine his extraordinary juvenile watercolours or study the romances into which more than into his paintings he threw inherited  qualities of prompt solid realistic invention and dramatic force and directness it is impossible to help marvelling at the breadth of his observation the keenness of his eye for scenery and natural forms and objects and the retentiveness with which he husbanded for use as occasion served the sights he saw and the facts he noted at sixteen or thereabouts after singular successes in watercolour painting he wrote the black swan as it is given in the second of these volumes the original draught of his gabriel denver which was published in 1873 by messrs smith and elder he had thought it out and those who take the trouble to read it will be struck by its strong imaginative power and sustained force of passion when he was yet but fifteen like an aeschylean drama in its limited dramatis personae the black swan has but three actors on its scene which is mostly the burning wreck of a tasmanian emigrant ship a strongwilled halfeducated settler his unloved desperate wife and the girl whom gabriel denver idolises and who clings to him in life and death with a sort of mesmeric fascination there are some bits of this extraordinary tale eg gabriel denvers dream from which he wakes to a gradual discovery of the ship being on fire his jealous wifes doing and that wifes previous overhearing gabriel and lauras lovemaking upon the deck while they remain as utterly unconscious of her presence  as a bird is of a lynx which is hidden in the foliage waiting for a spring   or again in the crisis of the black sivanjs fate the description of the way in which fire and water clear away all the live figures from the burning deck except a trio  physically held together as the author puts it  by the ties of passion the hatred and love which entangled them mentally which must be owned to be of grand conception and the phenomena of the ocean on which they drift in an open boat for three or four days in its rest and its disturbance as well as of hunger and thirst in their gradually developed stages betoken a conscientious study of records of like adventures not always to be found in young authors of rich imagination the writer of such a tale may have resolved to forsake the brush from other motives than  some restive idiosyncrasy  forbidding him  to tread the paternal vestiges perhaps he felt a constraining sense that the canvas fails to tell a whole tale with the breadth and detail and ample verge of the written romance anyhow he dedicated himself to literature the dwale bluth a devon synonym of the deadly nightshade arose out of a five weeks visit to

tanta rabobs huxen or the devils ankleblade and the tradition of a family bold and mad enough to cherish an ancestral dwelling beneath the latter furnished him with a theme sufficiently full of loves and hates and marriages and misadventures to supply ample food for a thrilling tale of wonder and terror into this tale the aspiring author throws two ingredients unmeddled with by him hitherto

yellow binding with black figures of a burning ship and wreathing smoke and gnawing rats stamped upon the back appeared before the world it was easy for the critics to discern power in its graphic

impression finally left was one of repulsion and distaste for few of the readers of the tale were not aware that its author was still a boy and that  gabriel denver was written when oliver madoxbrown was but seventeen years of age had they known this the feeling of wonder and of hope would have been stronger than any other the volumes before us contain the first version of gabriel denver which bore originally the picturesque name of the black swan a name which the publishers with the same stupidity that insisted on altering hawthornes the marble faun into transformation changed into the present commonplace title the same unhappy influence also weakened the story itself by changing the jealous wife into a lover and by giving to the hideous plot an inartistically happy end of the memoir with which the volumes open there is nothing good to say two editors might between them one would think have given a sketch of this gifted boy which would have impressed itself on the memory as it is there are in all but twenty pages and of these about a third are with questionable taste taken up with the prattlings of his childhood and the ravings of his last delirium did he write no letters that might be quoted1 is nothing of his conversation when in health remembered 1 some memorial lines alone by mr philip marston which in their pathetic beauty recall cowleys elegy on mr william harvey seem to convey to us an idea of what oliver madoxbrown really was for the rest we have the barest facts he was born in 1855 when he was eight he began to paint in watercolour in 18g0 when only fourteen he was an exhibitor at the dudley gallery in 1871 he exhibited at the new british institution and in the winter of that year he turned his brush into a pen and wrote the black swan there came some unfinished romances which are here presented to the world and thenthe end in 1874 the poor boy died his brain active to the last still planning new stories or visited by strange visions of the stories before us the fragmentit is only a fragmentcalled  the dwale bluth  a local name for the deadly nightshade is decidedly the finest there is something about it which reminds us of the brontesbut of emily rather than of charlotte this resemblance which seems also to have struck mr marston is chiefly in the character of the incidents and the description of scenery while a certain introspective glance a certain mode of tracing out subtle analogies between the outer life of nature and the inner life of man recalls the still greater name of the famous american romancewriter the very way in which the dwale bluth clings to the hair and poisons the wearer seems to show its relationship to the flowers in rappaccinis garden or among zenobias tresses or by the grave which septimius had dug the story flows clearly along till the end of helens childhood then there i3 apparently a gap and although some other chapters are carefully written and highly finished they do not piece so readily with the first part and after all the tale remains unfinished the faults of the dwale bluth are scarcely noticeable among its rare merits but there is certainly at times an overelaboration in details and the reader might have been spared the unintelligible dialect of devonshire which requires a constant footnote of translation and which therefore adds nothing to the true colouring of the picture on the other hand what power there is in every page what imagination and at times what humour the early history of the serpletons the squire and his gypsy wife the parson with his knowledge of books and his ignorance of all besides the little halfgipsy helenall this is described with a precision and force that call up again unavailing regrets for what this wonderful literary faculty might hereafter have produced no extracts can in the least do justice to the impression which the entire story leaves upon the reader and the following are given only as showing something of the style and spirit in which the work is written   in the autumn examined from the bridlepaths across the distant heights serpleton house but for its pointed gables and the thin wreaths of smoke from its chimneysmight have been taken for one of those huge white fragments of rock with which the northern heights of dartmoor are strewn so wildly projecting from the hillside in a profusion of purple heather and golden furzeblossom in the spring the ancient appletrees along its unenclosed orchards grew radiant in the windy sunlight under the blue sky among the purple cloud  shadows but in the winter with the keen boisterous east wind heavy with mist and sleet driving across the sterile moorlands and whistling harshly through its crevices turning its chimneys and corridors into a monstrous series of organpipes and playirjg sinister tunes on themserpleton house must have looked dreary indeed for a human dwellingplace or take thisthe wild little helen who had once seen the dwale bluth before and was always by some mysterious fascination longing for it goes one day into the deserted garden and rests on the edge of a broken cucumberframe  of a sudden she started and leaned over the broken bars there was what she had been looking after for her downcast eyes fell with an instantaneous revival of interest on the tendrils of the deadly nightshade loaded with poison flowers and berries crawling stealthily round the inside of the frame or crouching ignominiously along the damp ground the traces of snailtracks went all over the bricks and mould and the leaves were bitten here and there but it was singular to note what a number of empty snailshells were lying among its foliage in spite of this it had grown into a goodly plant the dwale bluth is a cowardly creeper and knows no means of rising above the earth it springs from unless by insinuating itself among the leaves of some bolder parasite there it now lay beneath her gaze even throwing a grim and sinister reflection on to her darkcomplexioned face and into her eyes  there it lay at her feet prone and helpless as though it were entreating her to life it how strangely artistic is the touch which marvels at the empty snailshells though the plant was vigorous   hebditchs legacy is still more incomplete than the  dwale bluth and is less easy to follow it would probably have been as weird though not so picturesque a story and there are some of the finest isolated passages in it that can be found among all these fragments the description of the fog in the dying womans room with which  hebditchs legacy opens is hardly inferior to the stormscene in the other tale a curious instance only slightly more marked than many others of the way in which the trained perception of the painter could give reality to the writers scene occurs towards the end of this tale  but facing each other as the uncle and nephew were mr blackoder still had the advantage for he sat with his back to the light and his face was indistinguishable the only features really visible in it were the eyes which witching perhaps the dim reflection of the great silver ipergne glowed under their overhanging brows with a keen motionless gleam of the shorter stories and of the poems there is not much to say they show the writers versatility but they do not show him at his best still for one wild fragment we must find place it is obscure no doubt but it has a something of the ballad ring about it these tracies were descended from one of the murderers of beckett and so woe to the unborn aeons of the tracies  say what redemption is left through all time ob could they reach to the land where gods grace i baffled and faint with the storm winded embrace the wind that wails for their forefatliers crime with ever the wind and rain in their faces never again till the end of time and now as we close these volumesunfinished and immaturewe feel more strongly than ever that a great literary artist was taken from the world by this boys early death of course it is possible that as years passed a genius which was developed so soon might have faded away in the common light of every day but if it had grown with his growth oliver madoxbrown must have taken rank with the great masters of romance as it is we have only these broken remains and this totally inadequate memoir for the first there is now no help but as regards the second it is not too late to hope that the editors will give us such a life as may have both a psychological and a literary value,unmarked

the patrician by john galsworthy heinemann there is a grim intellectuality about mr galsworthy an objectivity worthy of the great russians and it is perhaps this very grimness which fascinates us in the patrician this grimness of intellect this reserve this chastity of soul enthrals even while it disturbs one thinks of the theatricality of wells in the new macbiavelli one sees mr galsworthy clad in a roman shirt as it were calm chaste serene mellow in this book the author deals with types and it is a pity the title is not used in the plural for it is of a class or caste that he writes of the fatality of character of that which we individually have within us that determines our lives there is a young lord in love with a woman not of his monde and separated from her husband there is his beautiful sister in love with a democratic writer who according to social canon is an outsider yet the forces of environment of birth training custom tradition overpower them the lord is unable to risk his career in order to marry the woman he loves the only woman he ever has loved the girl is constrained to marry in her own class mr galsworthy is no doubt right oov 6vopwrt 8aqwt it is a joy to read this book to know that here is a true writer seeking the truth and the expression of it it is a very fine if perhaps not a great book mr galsworthy seems to have changed too the bitterness has left him the iconoclast of his earlier work has become a philosopher an artist rather than a reformer but with the change there is a perceptible tenuity in force and spontaneity some of the characterisation seems overcharged miltoun the lord is surely overdrawncertainly he is not a type and his behaviour on various occasions seems curiously at variance with the aristocratic  sport  of today who marries on the stage or seeks a plutocratic wife in america however by patrician  mr galsworthy may have had some distinctive type in his mind to us he is almost inhumanhe leaves a want so too does the  outsider  surely be would have taken this juno of a  babe  in his arms well well mr galsworthy is early roman there are delightful things in the book touches of exquisite delicacy of

a distinguished book by reason of its style and because of the exactness and perfection with which the portraits of the characters are worked in upon the brain until the reader is confident that not merely would he know them if he met them in the street but would recognise them by their voices in another room lord miltoun the eldest son of the earl of valleys en route to the house of lords proposes to pause until that time comes in the house of commons where it is rightly expected that his marked abilities and family influence will give him both place and authority he is of the highest

  twenty years in the philippines bv paul de la gironiere vizetelly  co we owe this book to the vivacious author of  monte christo not that m dumas is its authorhe is only its cause alexander appears here as the falstaff of romancehe is not only a writer himself but the cause of writing in other men the usual friends and admirers had long and vainly urged m paul de la gironiere to give the story of his adventures to a reading and believing world our adventurer hesitated at so bold a step until he one day found his name in the feuilleton of the constitutionnel figuring among the  thousand and one phantoms of the great appropriator of other mens ideas and experiences m paul de la gironiere could keep silence no longer as a traveller he had seen strange sights  done valorous deedsgained a marvellous experience he had outlived a massacre married a fortune founded a colonyhe had combined in his own person the adventures of a rajah brook and a col dixon ofmairwara memoryhow then could he stand by and see himself reduced to a phantomand hear the story of hisown colony of jalajala mistold by the daring romancewriter of the constitutionneli such resignation was not in flesh and blood to prove that he was a man and not a phantomm paul de la gironiere resolved to take up the penand we are glad he did so for we have gained by his resolution an original and amusing book our author is evidently a selfconstituted hero in his intercourse with himself he has all the airs of a great manthe coolness courage complacency and aptitude in peril which reveal in spite of all disguises the born rulers of the world he chronicles his own perfections and successes with a frankness that anticipates objection and disarms criticism these are but the small weaknesses of strengthand it would be hard indeed if a man who has done the heroic things recorded here were not allowed to boast of them a little we are very well aware that reserve and modesty are no part of the education of a port stmartin heroand if the edge of the scarlet cloak will occasionally peep out beneath the more sober suit of our don medico it is nature and accident rather than he man himself that are at fault is not the s imallest boy in the victoria pit always able to a iee the hero through his changing habits  if n vi paul de la gironiere be one of the favourites  f destiny so much the better for himand xe will add for his readers in spite of his ccasionai gasconade and perpetual selfsatisactionor because of thesewe have found the don an amusing companion and we readily forgive his airs on account of his vivacity his bonhomie his ready affection and his untiring spirits we must add that there is a tender as well as a ludicrous side to the story of this long residence in the philippine islands m de la gironiere goes out alone to the ends of the earth  he forms ties as it is in the nature of lonely men to do he marries and sees his hearth blessed with young children but they die in the long years one by one until the once solitary man is again alonealone with harrowing memories spirits no longer hopeful and energies no longer fresh and then he returns to the old land from which he had wandered in his youththe same man and yet how changed in all that gives the zest to life the closing pages of this volume have upon them a weight of melancholy that is almost tragic the philippine islands are comparatively unbroken ground mackmicking has written an account of these islands crawford horace st john and other writers have glanced at them an interesting ms history of the islands written by a resident of many years is now before us but we hold it no disparagement to these writers to assert that m paul de la gironiere has given us altogether the most lively and interesting description of life in these southern islands that we have ever seen to come to particulars let us hear don medico expatiate on the graces of the manilla women  in the evening spaniards english and french go to the promenades to ogle the beautiful and facile halfbred women whose transparent robes reveal their splendid figures that which distinguishes the female halfbreeds spanishtagals or chincsetagals is a singularly intelligent and expressive physiognomy their hair drawn back from the face and sustained by long golden pins is of marvellous luxuriance they wear upon the head a kerchief transparent like a veil made of the pine fibre finer than our finest cambric the neck is ornamented by a string of large coral beads fastened by a gold medallion a transparent chemisette of the same stuff as the headdress descends as tar as the waist covering but not concealing a bosom that has never been imprisoned in stays below and two or three inches from the edge of the chemisette is attached a variously coloured petticoat of very bright hues over this garment a large and costly silk sash closely encircles the figure and shows its outline from the waist to the knee the small and white feet always naked are thrust into embroidered slippers which cover but the extremities nothing can be more charming coquettish and fascinating than this costume which excites in the highest degree the admiration of strangers how our don fascinates one of these beauties a lady beautiful as a byronian heroine rich as one ot marryats damselsand how he wooes and weds her after the set fashion on the stage of the lyceum or the haymarketwe will not pause to relate that he knew how to protect the beauty lie had won as well as any don who ever trod the stage we must however allow him to bear witness as we went one morning to the cascades we were about to alight at yangyang when all at once our carriage was surrounded by brigands flying from the soldiers of the line the chieffor we supposed him to be so at firstsaid to his companions not paying the slightest attention to us  we must kill the horses bv this i saw he feared lest their enemies hold make use of our horses to pursue them with presence of mind which fortunately never abandons northeast in difficult or perilous circumstances i said to lim  do not fear  my horses shall not be used by our enemies to pursue you rely upon my word ihe chief put his hiind to his cap and thus addressed lis comrades  if such lie the case the spanish oldiers will do us no harm today neither let us do my follow me they marched off and i intantly drove rapidly away in quite an opposite direcion from the soldiers the bandits looked after me ny good faith in keeping my word was successful i lot only lived a few months in safety at tierraalta ut many years after when i resided in jalajala md in my quality of commander of the territorial lorse guards of the province of lagune was natually a declared enemy ofthe bandits i received the following note  sir beware of pedro tumbaga we are invited by him to go to your house and to take you by surprise we remember the morning ive spoke to you at the cascades and the sincerity of our word you are an honourable man if we find ourselves face to face with you and it be necessary we will fight but faithfully and never after having laid a snare keep therefore on your guard beware of pedro tumbaga  he is cowardly enough to hide himself in order to shoot you everybody must acknowledge i had to do with most polite robbers i answered them thus you are brave follows i thank you for your advice but i do not fear pedro tumbaga i cannot conceive how it is you keep among you a man capable of hiding himself to kill his enemy if i had a soldier like him i would soon let him have justice and without consulting the law a fortnight after my answer tumbaga was no more a bandits bullet disembarrassed me of him we doubt if any hero at the victoria could have done it better m de la gironiere has much to do with bandits afterwards when he becomes king paul founder of the colony of jalajala and ruler of the tribes of tagaloc but before we look on him in his little kingdom we will glance at these tagaloc the people over whom he had to rule  the character of though tagaloc is extremely difficult to define lavater and gall would have been very much embarrassed by it for both physiognomy and craniology would be perhaps equally at a loss amongst thc philippines the natural disposition of the tagal indian is a mixture of vices and virtues of good and bad qualities a worthy priest has said when speaking of them they are great children and must bo treated as if they were little ones it is really curious to trace and still more so to read the moial portrait of a native of though philippine islands though indian keeps his word and jetwill it bo believed he is a liar anger he holds in horrorhe comparts it to madness and even prefers drunkenness which however he despises he will not hesitate to usc thc dagger to avenge himself for injustice  but what he can least submit to is an insult even when merited when he has committed a fault he may bc punished with a flogging this he receives without a murmur but he cannot brook an insult he is brave generous and a fatalist the profession of a robber which lie willingly exercise ii agreeable to him on account of the lite of liberty and adventure it affords and not because it may lead to riches generally speaking the tagalocs are good fathers and good husbands both these qualities being inherent horribly jealous of their wives but not in the least of the honour of their daughters and it matters little if the women they marry have committed errors previous to their union they never ask for a dowrythey themselves provide it and make presents to the parents of their brides they dislike cowards but willingly attach themselves to the man who is brave enough to face danger play is their ruling passion and they delight in the combats of animals especially in cockfighting here was material of a somewhat unpromising natureand we are not certain that the first demonstration of the european was quite so wise and successful as the don himself appears to think even taking his own account ot it for gospel  two indians came one day to lodge a complaint against one of their comrades living at some leagues distance from jalajala these informers accused him of having stolen cattle after i had heard all they had to say i set ott with my guard to seie upon the accused and brought him to my residence there i endeavoured to make him confess his crime but he denied it and said he was innocent it was in vain i promised him if he would tell the truth to grant him his pardon for he persisted even in the presence of his accusers persuaded however that he was telling me falsehoods and disgusted with his obstinacy in denying a fact which had been sworn to me with every appearance of sincerity i ordered him to be tied upon a bench and receive a dozen strokes of a whip my orders were executed  but the culprit denied the chargas he had done before this dogged perseverance irritated me and i caused another correction to bc administered to him the same as the first the unfortunate man bore his punishment with unshaken courage but in the midst of his sufferings he exclaimed in penetrating accents oh  sir i swear to you that i am innocent but as you will not believe mc take me into your house i will be a faithful servant and you will soon have proofs that i am the victim of au infamous calumny these words affected me i reflected that this unfortunate man was perhaps not guilty after all i began to fear i had been deceived and had unknowingly committal an act of injustice i felt that private enmity might have led these two witnesses to make a false declaration and thus induce me to punish an innocent man i ordered him to be untied the proof you demand i said to him  is easily tried if you are an honest mau i shall be a father to you but if you deceive me do not expect any pity from me from this moment you shall be one of my guard  my lieutenant will provide you with arms he thanked me earnestly and his countenance lit up with sudden joy he was installed in my guard oh human justice how fragile and how often unintelligible art thou some time after this event i learned that b tilio de la cruzthis was the name of the manwas innocent man is liable to err and it is too often through the gates of wrong that rulers pass into the path of right our don seems to have had a more summary mode of dealing with the bandits who infested jalajala but alas for the novelty who has not seen the same experiment tried a thousand times with thc same success in a thousand nulodiamas  i frequently walked in the forests alone with my gun under my arm suddenly a bandit would spring out as if by enchantment from behind a tree armed from top to toe and advance towards nie laster said he to me putting one knee to the ground i will be an honest man  take me under your protection  i asked him his name  if he had been marked out by the high court of justice i would answer him severely   withdraw and never present yourself again before me  i cannot forgive you and if i meet you again i must do my duty if he was unknown to me i would kindly say to him  follow me follow whither m de la gironiere tells us to virtue and the church but with certain small concessions as we shall see to the old predatory instinct of his converts and followers  i found that it was necessary to provide some amusement compatible with the tastes manners and habits of my former bandits who had led for so long a space of time such a wandering vagabond life for this purpose i allowed hunting on all parts of my estate conditionally however that i should take beforehand as tithe a quarter of any stag or wild boar they should kill i do not think that ever a sportsmanone of those men reclaimed from the paths of vice to those of virtuefailed in this engagement or endeavoured to steal any game i have often received seven or eight haunches of venison in a day and those who brought them were delighted to be able to otter them to mc king paul was on the whole tolerably successful with his colony that his effects are descriptively disposed in pictures and his virtuous and nappy villagers grouped as in the background of an opera  in vineyards copied from the south of france is rather the incidental result of his dramatic instinct than an impeachment of his sober truth we have no doubt that our don and the amiable donna anna his wife did much good at the colony of jalajala and we regret that his taste for storytelling has prevented him from setting down the practical details of his management such as those which render col dixons account of his doings at mairwara so interesting to the statesman and public writer the dons experiment at jalajala led him to explore the northern parts of the island of luzon perhaps his notes on the natives of these provinces will be considered by those who delight in comparing the manners of men as the most interesting in his work from these we can extract only a few curiosities here is an odd indian custom as regards divorce the tinguian has generally one legitimate wife and many mistresses but the legitimate wife alone inhabits the conjugal house and the mistresses have each of them a separate cabin the marriage is a contract between the two families of the married couple the day of the ceremony the man and wife bring their dowry iu goods and chattels  the marriage portion is composed of china vases glass coral beads and sometimes a little gold powder it is of no profit to the married couple for they distribute it to their relations this custom my guide observed to me has been established to prevent a divorce which could only take place in entirely restituting all the objects that were contributed at the marriage by the party asking for divorcea rather skilful expedient for savages and worthy of being the invention of civilised people the relatives thus become much interested in preventing the separation as they would le obliged to restitute the presents received  and if one of the couple persisted in requesting it they would prevent him or her by making away with one of the objects furnished such as a coral necklace or a china vase without this wiso measure it is to be supposed that a husband with mistresses would very often endeavour to obtain a divorce among king pauls own subjects the tagaloc the method of wooing and wedding was ancient and peculiarevery tagal jacob having to earn his rachel as the hebrew patriarch won his bride marriage says m de la gironiere  is preceded by two other ceremonies the first of which is called tain manock tagal words signifying or meaning the cock looking after his hen therefore when once a young man has informed his father aud mother that he has a predilection for a young indian girl his parents pay a visit to the young girls parents upon some fine evening and after some very ordinary chat the mamma of the young man offers a piastre to the mamma of the young ludy should the future motherinlaw accept the young lover is admitted and then his future motherinlaw is sure to go and spend the very same piastre in betel and cocoawino during the greater portion of though night the whole company assembled upon the occasion chews betel drinks cocoawine nnd discusses upon all other subjects but marriage the young men never make their appearance till the piastre has lieen accepted because in that case they look upon it ns being the avantcourrierthat is the first and most essential step towards their marriage on the next day the young man pays a visit to the mother father and other relations of his affianced bride there lie is received as one of the family he sleeps there he lodges there takes a part in all the labours and most particularly in those labours depending upon the young maids superintendence he now undertakes a service or task that lasts moro or less two three or four years during which time he must look well to himself for if anything be found out against him ho is discarded and never more can pretend to the hand of her he would espouse the spaniards did their best to suppress this custom on account of the inconveniences it entailed very often the father of the young girl in order to keep in his service a man who cost him nothing keeps on this state of servitude indefinitely and sometimes dismisses him who hat served him for two or three years and takes another under the same title of pretendant or lover but it also frequently happens that if the two lovers grow impatient for the celebration of the marriage ceremony for  hope deferred maketh the heart sick some day or other the young girl takes the young man by the hair and presenting him to the curate of the village tells him she has just run away with her lover therefore they must be married the wedding ceremony then takes place without the consent of the parents but were the young man to carry off the young girl he would be severely punished and she restored to her family here we may pause our mark is on many another passage of this curious volume but we have given enough to show the strangeness of its materials and the manner in which they are disposed to those who would know more of life in the philippine islands as related by the founder of jalajala we must recommend the volume from which we have drawn these

fiction the loom of youth by a waugh grant richards 6s net this young but useful novel on public school life has excited wide interest it is a healthy sign the english review first attacked that senile conservative dead sea institutionthe public schoolsbut that was before tihe war and men merely smiled the vapid semicontemptuous class smile of indifference today people have begun to think again there is no sensation in this book the writer avoids the schoolboy writers pet hobby a fight and there are too many accounts of  footer matches and perhaps too many omissions to justify genuine praise yet the tone and spirit are true youth speaks from every page and youth is what we want in this country and the boy writer while shrewdly critical manages to avoid the unpleasant with that delightful healthiness which is one at any rate of the virtues of the system the evil he clearly diagnoses as the games worship there he is right he sketches the rise of his young caruthers to the very top and leaves him silently questioning well that is philosophy and if many boys ever attain to that attitude on quitting school they have learned something the language is a little astonishing that is new twenty years ago the language was school slang not whitechapel let us hope papas and mammas will read this bright exposition and learn that if england is to recover she must reform these schools,unmarked

the secret of the wild in this u unusual account of wild life in england to quote the subtitle mr calvert has written a book of great originality and charm he has the combined gifts of naturalist novelist and essayist the dedication to his father suggests that the work is in large measure auto biographical though doubtless an element o f fiction has been introduced t h e volume gives us a vivid and detailed account of wild life in a mountainous p a r t of england which w e a r e probably right in identifying as a corner of lakeland but the authors extraordinarily sensitive observations of animal and bird life are described pholo by mr w a calvert e 0 hvpppi against a human background there is indeed a wordsworthian atmosphere in these pages and we might almost call the volume a prose  excursion mr calvert brings us into intimate contact with wild nature as seen through the eyes of a child growing stage by stage to maturity the book opens with a portrait of old isaac pharaoh the molecatcher who having in his youth been disappointed in love has lived for many years a solitary  isaac pharaoh had become a man apart and the younger generation that knew not at all or perhaps only imperfectly the tragedy of his youthful daydreams passed him by as a man of unpleasant disposition and one to be avoided he worked alone and many were the rumours of his hoarded wealth but none dare question him nor had any human being crossed the threshold of his cottage a pretty little thatched building standing in a clump of trees at the foot of the hill just below the outlet of the lake he had prepared the place for his bride but since she had refused to enter none other had been permitted to do so his garden was large enough to provide him with every vegetable he needed and the keepers stated that the game of the home plantations and the fish from both lake and river supplied him the year round with all his meat one night however as isaac is about his business of molecatching he finds an abandoned baby upon the hillside he takes the child home with him and brings him up with a mothers care as soon as crispin is old enough he becomes isaacs companion in all his wanderings and activities and growing into a strong boy he is able at length to roam farther afield by himself his environment offers him abundant variety of scope for observation and adventure  crispins home stood on a promontory at the parting of the waterswhere the lake ceased and became a swiftflowing river a wall bounded the north side of the garden and from it one could see right up to the pass at the head of the dale the surrounding fells were bare and rugged and a solitary island which lay some few hundred yards above the cottage was thoroughly in keeping with them this island was not very big in fact it was little more than a heap of mammoth boulders but at one end there rose a conicalshaped pinnacle with a scraggy holly bush growing at the summit and tufts of heather and parsleyfern adorning the sides no living creature dwelled there   the secret of the wild by w r calvert 12s 6d hutchinson in sensitive poetic prose which never lapses into sentimentality mr calvert follows crispins development as a boy and youth living close to the heart of nature in her wildest moods the 1 fe of mountain and stream of marsh and seashore is described with a wealth of intimate detail that will fascinate all nature lovers the author has many new storiesobviously the fruit of his own patient and loving observationabout the more familiar kinds of animal fish and bird but he introduces us also to lesser known species one of his most arresting chapters dealing with the very rare visit to this part of england of some ospreys mr calvert is no gilder of the natural he is keenly alive to the red tooth and claw in nearly all his pictures and stories of wild life there is a tragic element yet his pages are full of the beauty and poetry that are inseparably bound up with tragedy and throughout his book the human interest is naturally and powerfully sustained with the pathetic passing of old isaac and the idyllic courtship of crispin he brings to an end a volume in which fact and sentiment are blended with rare taste and fragrance gilbert thomas,unmarked
i fen vcc the last of nelson s aijantemnons captain oliamikks bkn 11uack hy captain iiamikk rn author of 44 the life of a sailor c l vols bentley london bkitisu seamen have always fought with enthusiasm and enthusiasm they have always inspired whenever they have been either written or talked about by any thing with a heart better than a split block or a condemned dead eye much of this high feeling is indigenous and inherent in the british animal itruns in his blood he is pugnacious for the mere pleasure of fighting and generally victorious from the mere est with which he sets about thrashing his enemies now all this is very well but were it not for other considerations would be prone to degenerate into brutality and ferocity and the warrior would be converted into the savage it cannot be expected nor is it perhaps desirable that the refinements of education should polish the subordinate class of seamen to which we allude nor have they as yet very extensively had that effect but other and very powerful causes have been in operation which have elevated the mere instinct of courage to the noble sentiment of heroism and taught the british sailor that respect for himself his hardships and his privations that have brought all the noble virtues in their train among which the beaming forehead of mercy has ever shone conspicuously this elevation of character this feeling of superiority that exists in spite of his ignorance and in the midst of his isolation from the rest of his species so characteristic of the british seaman we hope we may still say of the present day arises almost wholly from two causes the first the example and the influence of his officers the second the inspiriting and elevating stimulus of nautical literature with the first cause on reviewing this work we have nothing further to do than to say that this stimulus has in a degree extended aft from the forecastle and the same song that has cheered the captain of the forecastle has not wholly been ineffective upon thc feelings of the captain himself mere nautical literature was at a very low ebb until the time of smollett  that vivacious witty and very graphic author was the first who turned the public attention to the physical singularities and moral idiosyncrasies of the sturdy british tar but he only described he sought neither to elevate or improve he pourtiaed with the fidelity ufa moreland and filth consequently too often made up the greatest part of the picture had it not been for his sterling humour the nautical parts of his writings would have been intolerable after this for the lapse of nearly fifty years jack was permitted to play the fool fight and conquer without attracting any notice to his mere personal and distinctive character he certainly had improved a little and but a very little and that improvement arose merely from the reflex of his superior officers even the stirring times and the menacing events of the parker mutiny drew little attention to the mass beyond securing to them a somewhat more liberal allowance and a grcuter protection from the caprices of tyranny classes of men like nations must have their peculiar literature before they can be justly described either as flourishing or much better than semibarbarous as yet no generous writer had started fearlessly from the ranks of literary routine either to direct or do justice to the energies of the british sailor who consequently was generally regarded by his brethren of the sod as little better than a courageous brute at sea and a blustering fool on shore dibdin wrote and at once a halo of light danced upon the sailors brow the songs spoke to his heart humanised and ennobled it he now knew the value of his own bravery and consequently honoured the bravery of his enemy he affixed immediately a higher notion to the word duty  and his duty henceforward became his pride ami his pleasure these songs gave him principle and taught him patriotism they braced his heart in danger and softened it in repose riley did more they converted passion into sentiment and planted in his bosom selfveneration from that time jack was somebody and not only somebody but somebody of consequence also but still something also was wanting the more properly to elucidate his character and make the world acquainted with his sterling qualitiesin the detail and thus individually improve upon the opinion that the public began tohaveof him generally from the songs of dibdin as yet to the world at large he was nothing but an abstract idea though a noble one dibdin not being a siilor himself could not supply thc deficiency all was vagueness and uncertainty till captain flashed forth upon the orlop deck the light of literature and the mutiny at the nore became a classical event thc nnuticolyrical poet had prepared the waythe novelist stepped forward and the navy was provided with a literature that is peculiarly its ow n and so excellent that it may successfully compete with t lat of 44canip or court or grove we of all persons cannot bc expected to enumerate the able novel writers that have done honour to themselves and improved the condition and advanced the estimation of ail those connected with their servicethe list is ample and brilliant for each class of officers has found its chronicler and thc work now before us has undertaken to describe the nobleinindedness and the high moral superiority of the manofwars foremast man the character of 44 ben brace is genuine he is the glorious type of a glorious class certainly not the th tit idea but actually the imin not of a thorough british seaman 44 the last of the agamemnons how sonorous how homeric is the title and how true ben brace tells his own tale in proprid personaand how beautifully he tells it his idiom is critically classicalnot a flaw to be found in his maindeck dialect it is wey with thc flavour of thc grog tub and redolent of tar and oakum his metaphors they fly out as freely as thc pennant in the breeze his reasonings are as close as yardarm and vardarm and as consecutive as the marines and afterguard tailing on the main braces and his conclusions invariably chockablock the land lubbers dont perhaps understand this how should they oor fellows theyve never had any education a man must go to sea to learn something well cliamier has hooked ben brace on to lord nelsonfrom the first trip of the latter to the death that ratified his immortality on board the victory at the battle of trafalgar we have therefore a complete biography of our greatest naval hero in the very complete and graphic phraseology of this best of all bens but the reader will never understand its excellence until we give him a specimen of it where shall we choose  it is a matter of indifference for should we be so unadvised as to point out this or that particular part as thc best we have only to turn over another leaf and find a still better but before we extract we must premise that though nelson s life is the main stream of the story there are several excellent episodes bens own affairs being the best he has just returned to his old father and mother in their cottage in cawsand bay he has the rhino in his pouch and the attorneys clerk is rather importunate for the old gentlemans rentthe clerk looks warlike now ben go on 44 4 what says i 4 have you cleared

the old fisherman  to find bon at such a moment is worth all the money in the world now the attorney may go to i could dance a hornpipe and kick up bobs adying 44 night came on and a precious night it was mother was for giving me their bed and father talked of pricking for the softest plank hut i said 4 no im the youngest and the host to caulk the seam  so i took up my station in the old chair though i have stood by nelsons side when the proudest victory ever gained was won yet 1 never felt as i did at that moment i thought somehow i could fly i felt so light so happy well the old pair blessed me1 that had left them and had occasioned such distress to them and who had i remained might perhaps have saved jane also then father snapped his fingers and says he 4 a dogfishs eye for that snubnosed attorneys clerk  well manage somehow and they went to bed  i slept like a top and was making up the leeway of my nap when i heard a row at the door and i saw the little shark the clerks master with his precious assistant who was marked with a pair of beautiful black eyes and his nose as bits as a cocoanut 44  halloa shipmate said i 4 you lintot have run stun on to thc chimneysweep and taken some of bis soot to paint your figurehead 44 4 here is the account of rent due for this house said be to my luther  do you intend to pay it  44 4 how much is it obi snuff and twopenny said 1

whilst the old one blockaded the port he soon returned with the receipt 44 4 theres your money my boy said i  4 and i dont want any receipt foi the attack you made upon me last night and tore my shirt i see you show that as ptain aa thc nos un your face so brush old sweepings ami tapestrings nothing personal you knowbut curse me if ever 1 saw such an illbegotten bandylegged beggar with eyes like two burnt boles in a blanket and mouth like a sick codfish so away be went here is something of the manner and something of the matter ot ben brace however as we have begun upon braces own life instead of his masters nelson for he was his steward on shore as well as being his coxswain on board we will veer and haul upon it a little longer brace has a sister a sweet girl who has been seduced by one tackle a clever brave overbearing blackguard smuggler in his second visit to his parents he meets without knowing her this sister and travels with her and her sickly delicate infant in the same waggon she has been deserted and her intention is now to leave her child with her parents without making herself known and then to commit suicide ben relieves her of course as yet they know not each other jane has placed the child in a basket ben stumbles over it at the threshold of her fathers cottageit is taken inand a letter discovers the name of the poor child ben rushes out to find the mother having with great difficulty prevailed upon his parents to receive and bless her he sees something that at first he supposes to be a ghost 44 i gave a start hack and 1 felt a cold shiver run through me as if i hail touched a dead one then came again the same low dismal moaning and 1 got as much a coward as the two captains in benbows action  why says i to myself 4 ben brace ure you afraid and nelsons coxswainnot a bit of it so i tried again i went steadily along the house saying my prayers when 1 distinguished a woman seated like under the lee of the stone in order to shelter herself from the inclemency of the weather 44 4 holloa messmate said i 4 you have got a bad birth of it here why you will lie blown to pieces before morning 44  leave me said the woman4 leave nie to die  i have lost my c bibi for iver  it bas been taken from nie  and i have waited here watchin the door which encloses my infant but is closed against me 4 i recollected the voice in a moment  it was that of the poor forlorn eieatme who bad come down with me in the waggon and whom i now knew to be my own sist r my heart swelled and my voice was almost stifled  1 was just able however to stammer ont 4 jane laue come to a brothers arms  4 is it you ben now 1 die happy  youll bo a father to itwont you ben and she jumped upon her foot and threw her arms round my nook 4 nownow promise me not to let it starve and 1 will go null die elsewhereoh my heart my heart 1 feel it breaking whenever 1 think i am to quit this place and leave it there hut ill stay until daylight  i have been at the window twice but i did not hear it cry  hut the wind shook the small shutter and may be it drowned its noise 44 i kissed jane and she gave me back a hundred she hung round my neck and she cried like a baby  it was some time before 1 took her by the hand and told her that father and mellier had forgiven her and that the door would he opened to her and that she must come with me 44 4 never bennever could i look she said 4 upon father and mother again they will curse me and i shall go mad no as yet 1 do not know if they have cursed meand that is some happiness oh  my child  my child  44  your mother has taken the child said 1 4 and 1 have been to though ferry to search for you 4  then it was you that kicked the basket oh how my heart tailed nie when 1 saw my child kicked in the dirt and did not dare to rosene it 44 4 jonie along jane said i  and 1 dragged her to the threshold 4 come jane and be a daughter to the old ones  and 1 rapped at the door 1 felt her tremble and she sank down at my feet my father opened the door he could not bring a light for the wind was boisterous   here she is father said i 44 4 where said he 44 4 here at my feet  the old man rushed toward his child  he seized her by the arm 4 jane jane  do 1 live to see you again  to bless you my lost one to comfort you  here s your child asleep and heres your mother  come cheer up  44 my mother looked at her daughter as she lay on the floor for we had lifted her in i got the big armchair  but 1 sawr jane shudder at though sight of it and she hung her head down to the ground i went to my mother and i touched her arm 4 mother said i your promise 44 but she looked at her daughter in a strange uuinrgiviug maimer by degrees 1 coaxed her nearer and nearer and no sooner did 1 place janes hand in hers and she felt the touch than she burst out acryingand blessed her child 1 never saw such a scene there was jane dripping wet lying along the floor she never spoke or cried  she was dried up by grief and there was her father the rough old fisherman whose life had been one struggle against the storms of heaven now beaten fairly beaton by a womans silent sorrow my mother had raised janes hoad and placed it on her knees whilst i stood behind my father endeavouring to shame my tears  well we got all hands to bed and the next morning 1 arose with the conscience of a man who has done a good act 1 was as light as a eork and skipped about like one of the figures we so in punchs box before we piped to breakfast i was on my road to susans which was about a hundred yards from our house she was up and received me very kindly  she saw i was in high spirits and asked me the reason  janes come back susan said i why what do you look so contemptuous about she is forgiven and youll come 1 know and see her and he her friend as you used to be   no no mr brace she answered   that i can never do think what the world would say if i was the friend of a bad woman  i should bo thought no bettor than she was no it must not be and i cannot consent to h ive a sistcrmlaw whose conduct has been so reprehensible 44 4 thats a long word susan said 1  and perhaps its a good one but it sounds like as much as to say you never will shake hands with my sister again  that you wont be ber friend now that she most requires it 44 4 certainly mr brace said she 4 that is what i mean 44 4 then vou never shall sav that von are mrs brace  and the sooner you are mrs tapes the sooner you may repent ot this ungenerous conduct 1 tell you what it is miss susan you see i came the captain over her 4 your beait is not in the right place or you would feel for one of your own sex ami rather endeavour to raise than to trample on her so goodbyc to you  we part company from this moment  and hereafter when that attorney bas cheated you out of your person and your property you will think oi the sailor the coxswain of nelson 44 theni took off my bat and making ber a proper bow lifting up let le to keep the balance even as i bobbed my bead and right hand   tfloodbve to von miss susan i i bone vou mav feel the satisfaction which i feel at this moment  for although i leave the girl 1 have loved ever since i was the height of a tireshovel yet 1 know that 1 have done what is right i just took a last look and i saw her lift ber apron to her eyes then run into her house 44 4 there said 1 as 1 nearly run foul o the attorney 4 thin es a clear coast tor you to smuggle upon old tapes but use her well for she is a nice craft alter all and we part friends so tip us your flipper and good luck to von both   we have staid so long on the nile that wc have no time to dwell ow the more glorious and fatal victory of trafalgar which is told it possible in a still more powerful manner but brace has not all the burden of narration upon himself he has a queer devilmaycare sort of fellow occasionally his shipmate and messmate who now and then spins out a very funny yarn of his own this facetious companion rejoices and makes every one else rejoice in thc euphonious title of tom toprail toms marriage at portsmouth is perhaps thc most humorous certainly thc most ludicrous part of thc novel the general reader may perhaps think it overcharged wc can assure him that it is by no means so seamen of ardent temperaments after a long confinement on boan a manofwar when they first put their feet ow shore really become jovially insane and arc actuated by none of thc impulses common to their less exalted fellow creatures lt is not pride that impels them to these ludicrous displays ot riding outside coaches with streamers flying and tiddlers scraping they know at the time that it is abominably foolish but wc arc inclined io think that they are moved to these absurdities more bv a spirit of mad daring than by any other impulse whatever may be the cause the tacts arc ridiculous enough and arc intolerably more disgusting in their actual perpetration in chainiers description they arc not only farcical but grotesquely humorous without ever departing from thc actual fact as these displays gradually becoming more untrcqucnt w ih through the improvement of thc seamans morah soon altogether cease and bc matter only of history it is consolatory to have the remembrance of them perpetuated by an historian so able as is captain clumner w o irii txmur hun  n ot though hattie ot though nile u lnrli n e u es otorai totom r  nno tor nmt ot room but to return to brace at the battle of trafalgar he gets lopped of an arm and at the same time that he loses his master his admiral and bb friend he loses also an eye but here we must notice a discrepancy that we cannot exactly explain if 1 baner nodded surely the 44 last of the agamemnon may be allowed to take a nap in the second volume ben tells us very shortly that being a cripple in june 1800 he went down to iosport ami married susan she then being with some children the widow of the lawyer tapes well being a married man he then tries back and after much yarning spins us out most excellently the battle of trafalgar which battle crippled him well in the third volume coming up with the body of nelson and performing a prominent part at the funeral ceremonies according to his late lordships request he repairs immediately to merton communicates with lady hamilton and then goes down not to iosport but to rochester to see his wife and had the satisfaction of finding a warm heart and a warm cottage ready to receive him we hope that this is all right for the sake of bens veracity for we should almost break our hearts if we found him tripping but we really cannot find as he never left the hotly of his old friend until it was interred how he could have possibly got married to susan after he became crippled for in another page he says explicitly thus 41 my duty drove mc to him who had ever been my friend and when my heart beat right again 1 resolved to obey his last command and go to merton lv yet 1 had not seen my wife for she was living near toetester on fifty pounds a year c thc mistake that ben makes about the seals on tackles secret papers is still more egregious but as the acute lawyers and counsel did not find it out in the memorable trial of brace reruns hawk wc shall also let it slip by in silence had we not mentioned these trivial errors so beautifully do wc think that captain barnier has done his work and so candidly do we express our opinion of its excellence that our notice would have appeared fulsome in its encomiums enough of this the fifty pounds a year permitted to bens wife as long as the seals of tackles secret remained unbroken are found to be insufficient to support the wife and family decently so brace becomes and glories in the metamorphosis a ireenwich pensioner all this part of his life is rich and genuinely natural we like the old sailor better as a pensioner than in any other capacity the tale now begins to wind up rapidly his few old shipmates die offold tom the last his sisters daughter by tackle of w hom he has a long while lost sight and who was a protegee of lord nelson and lady hamilton has in the interim married a post captain a lord and a young lord of the admiralty to boot the meeting between the uncle and niece is too good to be omitted  well i got thinking of ono thing and another when i was startled by the noise of a carriage which drew up alongside the gatos whilst two chaps in cocked hats and long canes who had been standing abaft jumped down opened the cabin door and out comes the captain and his wife ltp i got directly and steered towards the gate for 1 thought had never seen so tine a concern with such a crew the gentleman was a man about tiveaudfnrty togged off to thc nines and ho gives his ann to his ladv and makes sail right towards mc steering lor tin govt i mn

the way of all flesh the way op all flesh by samuel butler 11th impression of 2nd edition fifield 6s 6d net the appearance of a new impression of  the way of all flesh  in mr fifields edition of samuel butlers works gives us an occasion to consider more calmly the merits and the failings of that entertainnig story like all unique works of authors who stand even to the most obvious apprehension aside from the general path it has been overwhelmed with superlatives the case is familiar enough and the explanation is simple and brutal it is hardly worth while to give it the truth is that although there is no inherent reason why the isolated novel of an author who devotes himself to other forms should not be  one of the great novels of the world the probabilities tell heavily against it on the other hand an isolated novel makes a good stick to beat the age it is fairly certain to have something sufficiently unique about it to be useful for the purpose even its blemishes have a knack of being sui generis to elevate it is therefor bound to imply the diminution of its contemporaries yet apart from the general argument there are particular reasons why the praise of  the way of all flesh  should be circumspect samuel butler knew extraordinarily well what he was about his novel was written intermittently between 1872 and 1884 when he abandoned it in the twenty remaining years of his life he did nothing to it and we have mr streatfeilds word for it that  he professed himself dissatisfied with it as a whole and always intended to rewrite or at any rate to revise it we could have deduced as much from his refusal to publish the book the certainty of commercial failure never deterred butler from publication  he was in the happy situation of being able to publish at his own expense a book of whose merit he was himself satisfied his only reason for abandoning  the way of all flesh  was his own dissatisfaction with it his instruction that it should be published in its present form alter his death proves nothing against his own estimate butler knew at least as well as we that the good things in his book were legion he did not wish the world or his own reputation to lose the benefit of them but there are differences between a novel which contains innumerable good things and a great novel the most important is that a great novel does not contain innumerable good things you may not pick out the plums because the pudding falls to pieces if you do in  the way of all flesh however a compere is always present whose business it is to say good things his perpetual flow of asides is pleasant because the asides are piquant and in their way to the point butlers mind being a good mind had a predilection for the object and his detestation of the rotunder platitudes of a greek chorus if nothing else had taught him that a cornerman should have something to say on the subject in hand his arguments are designed to assist his narrative  moreover they are sympathetic to thc modern mind an enlightened hedonism is about all that is left to us and butlers hatred of humbug is though a little more placid like our own we share his ethical likes and dislikes as an audience we are ready to laugh at his asides and on the first night at least to laugh at them even when they interrupt the play but our liking for the theses cannot alter the fact that  the way of all flesh  is a roman d thises not that there is anything wrong with the roman d theses if the theses emerge from the narrative without its having to be obviously doctored nor does it matter very much that a compere should be present all the while provided that he does not take upon himself to replace the demonstration the narrative must afford by arguments outside it but what happens in  the way of all flesh   we may leave aside the minor thesis of heredity for it emerges gently enough from the story besides we are not quite sure what it is we have no doubt on the other hand about the major thesis it is blazoned on the title page with its submalicious quotation from st paul to the romans  we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the necessary gloss on this text is given in chapter lxviii where ernest after his arrest is thus described  he had nothing more to lose money friends character all were gone for a very long time if not for ever but there was something else also that had taken its flight along with these i mean the fear of that which man could do unto him cantabit vacuus who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already  let him but be able to earn his bread and he knew of nothing which he dared not venture if it would make the world a happier place for those who were young and loveable herein he found so much comfort that he almost wished he had lost his reputation even more completelyfor he saw that it was like a mans life which may be found of them that lose it and lost of them that would find it he should not have had the courage to give up all for christss sake but now christ had mercifully taken all and lo t it seemed as though all were found as the days went slowly by he came to see that christianity and the denial of christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do it was a fight about namesnot about things practically the church of rome the church of england and the freethinker have the same ideal standard and meet in the gentleman  for he is the most perfect saint who is the most perfect gentleman with this help the text and the thesis can be translated  all experience does a gentleman good it is the kind of thing we should like very much to believe as an article of faith it was held with passion and vehemence by dostoevsky though the connotation of the word  gentleman  was for him very different from the connotation it had for butler butlers gentleman it should be said in passing was very much the ideal of a period and not at all quod semper quod ubique  a very victorian antivictorianism dostoevsky worked his thesis out with a ruthless devotion to realistic probability he emptied the cornucopia of misery upon his heroes and drove them to suicide one after another and then had the audacity to challenge the world to say that they were not better more human and more lovable for the disaster in which they were inevitably overwhelmed and though it is hard to say  yes  to his challenge it is harder still to say  no in the case of ernest pontifex however we do not care to respond to the challenge at all the experiment is faked and proves nothing it is mere humbug to declare that a man has been thrown into the waters of life to sink or swim when there is an anxious but coolheaded friend on the bank with a 70000 litebelt to throw after him the moment his head goes under that is neither danger nor experience even if ernest pontifex knew nothing of the future awaiting him as we are assured he did not it makes no difference we know he cannot sink  he is a lay figure with a pneumatic body whether he became a lay figure for butler also we cannot say  we can merely register the fact that the book breaks down after ernests misadventure with miss maitland a deplorably unsubstantial episode to be the crisis of a piece of writing so firm in texture and solid in values as the preceding chapters ernest as a man has an intense nonexistence after all as far as tjie positive side of  the way of all flesh  is concerned butlers eggs are all in one basket if the adult ernest does not materialize the book hangs in empty air whatever it may be instead it is not a great novel nor even a good one so much established we may begin to collect the good things christina is the best of them she is on any standard a remarkable creation butler was  all round  christina both by analysis and synthesis she is wholly his he can produce her in either way she lives as flesh and blood and has not a little of our affection  she is also constructed by definition if it were not too awful a thing to say of anybody she meant well the whole phrase gives exactly christinas stature alethea pontifex is really a bluff  but the blurt succeeds largely because having experience of christina we dare not call it mrs jupp is triumphantly complete there are even moments when she seems greater than mrs quickly the novels that contain three such women or two if we reckon the uncertain alethea who is really only a vehicle for butlers very best sayings as cancelled by the nonexistent ellen can be counted we suppose on our ten fingers of the men theobald is well worked out in both senses of the word but we know little of what went on inside him we can fill out christina with her inimitable daydreams  theobald remains something of a skeleton whereas we have no difficulty at all with dr skinner of roughborough we have a sense of him in retirement steadily filling the shelves with volumes of skinner and we know how it was done when he reappears we assume the continuity of his existence without demur the glimpse of george pontifex is also satisfying  after the christening party we know him for a solid reality pryer was halfcreated when his name was chosen butler did the rest in a single paragraph which contains a perfect delineation of  the oxford manner  twenty years before it had become a disease known to ordinary diagnosis the curious may find this towards the beginning of chapter li but ernest upon whom so much depends is a phantoma dream child waiting the incarnation which butler refused him foi twenty years was it laziness was it a felt incapacity  we do not know but in the case of a novelist it is our duty to believe the worst the particularity of our attitude to butler appears in the fact that we are disappointed not with him but with ernest we are even angry with that young man if it had not been for him we believe  the way of all flesh  might have appeared in 1882 it might have shortcircuited  robert elsmere j m m poetry ano time warton lecture on english poetry ix by sir henry newbolt for the british academy humphrey milford ls net the haunting thought of time and transience and the desire for immortality are the stuff of which much of the worlds poetry is made  how the days draw in   is the lament of the anacreons  but they will draw out again the platonists and the christians hopefully reply  draw out indeed to an interminable length there are some who love the earth so well that the only fault they have to find witl lite is its shortness to others this existence is a horrible exile from a fatherland that lies somewhere remote and radiant beyond the bounds of time sir henry newbolt regards the poet as being almost by definition an exile homesick for eternity after showing what has been the attitude of different poets towards the whole problem of time he ventures to suggest to the future poet a new way of envisaging this first and gravest of questions the poets of the future must follow sir henry newbolt and professor mctaggart in regarding time as an illusion  they will be optimistic and encouraging about the destinies ol the world because the future is to be  a progressive manifestation of the eternal now this is one way of disposing of time but there are others the poets of the future may quite as justifiably regard time not as an illusion but as the most fundamental of realities life moves and has its being in time  transience and death are the conditions of existence lt may be that the poets of the future will cease to bewail their exile from a problematic eternity and will rejoice in the incessant movement of a force which is for ever creating and destroying and building again but the poets of the future may safely be left to solve the problem for themselves meanwhile we have to thank sir henry newbolt for a most suggestive lecture on a theme which might with profit be developed at greater length  the way of all flesh by samuel butler a posthumous wrork by the author of  erewhon a note tells us that it was begun in 1872 and that the author was engaged upon it intermittently until 1884  it is therefore to a great extent contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be taken as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book though story deals with an english family which had risen from obscurity and extends over about twothirds of the nineteenth century lt is deliberate philosophical and thoroughly characteristic of its author richards 6s  the way of all flesh bv samuel butler 6s grant richards nobody who is acquainted with mfr samuel butlers former works would look to him for a novel written on popular lines and the wav of all flesh  is as little like the conventional novel of the moment as it was possible to make it it has no intricate plot almost no plot at all for that would have savoured too much of artifice and mr butler had set himself to reveal in these pages the life history of four generations of the pontifex family and did it with a fearless realism and a keen irony and simplicity of style that for purposes of comparison send one back to fielding and swift for its chief interest the book relies and safely relies on its characters who are drawn with remarkable skill and with a profound knowledge of humanity a few pages suffice for a vivid and complete presentment of old mr pontifex who is seventy odd at the beginning of the nineteenth century a quaint rugged village carpenter something of a painter and musician with a gift for organbuilding drawn in more detail is his son george who goes early to london into the business of an uncle and is byandbye partner in an important publishing firm the unfolding of his personality is a fine piece of work  even more so are the subtle developments of georges second son cutlhbert and later of cuthberts son ernest the women of the book are rendered with equal truth they are neither idealised nor distorted but presented simply unflinchingly in the colour of actual life and with all the frailties of humanity it is a novel that has indubitable elements of greatness it is full of a shrewd somewhat cynical philosophy and mellow worldly wisdom and grows upon the reader with an increasing interest because of its strong but unexaggerated human appeal  new novels the way of all flesh by samuel butler i grant richards this posthumous story may be unattractive to the ordinary novel  roader it opens casually it lacks form it has no sensational climax and no heroine it is not a rounded whole but the record of part of a life written as a brief introductory note by mr streatfeild tells us between 1872 and 1884 it exhibits a young mans trials from boyhood his experience in the church his collapse and subsequent rehabilitation in the world in order to explain his qualities his father and mother his grandfather and even his greatgrandfather are paraded before us the older generations with more leisure than an expert novelist would allow himself the heros father a clergyman and his mother are most trenchant portraits but have a belated air as they belong to the time before darwinism such selfdeceiving aggressive pietism as theirs is now we hope rare thus much said as to things which may deter the reader we advise him to persevere in his perusal for he will be well rewarded the book is a lesson to parents concerning the upbringing of their children which is as much needed as ever mr butler an original thinker goes with unerring frankness into the very heart of his subject he says boldly but sometimes too fiercely what many are thinking you may not take his views of life but you will learn something from examining them his irony is a useful dissolvent while his humour and admirably simple style are more effective than much heavy rhetoric good things abound here is happy observation concerning a style which is virtually unassailable yet to many offensive as well as monotonous i daresay she writes very well but she has fallen under the dominion of the words hope think  i feel  try  i bright and  little and can hardly write a page without introducing all these words and some of them more than once there are hints of autobiography too as in the following passagewith the public generally he is not a favourite he is admitted to have talent but it is considered generally to be of a queer un practical kind and no matter how serious he is he is always accused of being in jest his first book was a success for reasons which i have already explained but none of his others have been more than creditable failures he is one of those unfortunate men each one of whose books is sneered at by literary critics as soon as it comes out but becomes  excellent reading as soon as it has been followed by a later work which may in its turn be condemned the book is in fact a genuine piece of samuel butler and that means work of a rare kind by a unique man  fiction the way op all flesh by samuel butler grant richards this posthumous tale by the author of  erewhon  is not really the latest of his works a prefatory note by mr r a streatfield tells us that it was written between 1872 and 1884 and then laid aside with the intention that some day it should be rewritten it is extremely characteristic of mr samuel butlers individual temperament and outlook upon life whimsical and discursive in method racy in expression and full of satire which is often genial and occasionally to our taste at least a little acrid according to mr streatfield the work was largely contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be regarded as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book we regret that we do not recall what mr butlers precise theory of heredity is what the way of all flesh chiefly illustrates is the antagonism of the generations and its satire is mainly levelled at certain more or less unconscious views of parental responsibility which the author detects lurking beneath the moral pretensions of the british bourgeoisie they may be summed up as  willbreaking  at that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod was to spoil the child and st paul had placed disobedience to parents in very ugly company if his children did anything which mr pontifex disliked they were clearly disobedient to their father in that case there was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take it consisted in checking the first signs of selfwill while his children were still too young to offer serious resistance if their wills were  well broken in childhood to use an expression then much in vogue they would acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture to break through till they were over twentyone years old then they might please themselves  he should know how to protect himself till then he and his money were more at their mercy than he liked the narrative for mr butler is nothing if not biographical carries us through the history of several generations of pontifexes it is upon the head of the rev theobald pontifex who has the misfortune to be a priest as well as a parent that the vials of the authors scorn are most liberally poured and the story culminates in the career of the rev theobalds son ernest the will of ernest pontifex is broken in youth he grows up with an extreme ignorance of the world which lands him first in prison and subsequently in a most undesirable marriage finally he touches earth like antaeus in the bitterness of experience and rises up to be a man and hate his father a philosophical doctrine as to the formation of character by personal experience seems to be at the bottom of the book but it must be observed that ernest pontifex was much helped in the task of recovering his balance in life by the receipt of an unexpected legacy of 70000,unmarked

the green parrot by bernard capes i smith elder  co is mr capess new story there is a novelist who writes romance which wins the favour of the discreet but has no success among the public we hope that mr capess romance is more fortunate than john wisdoms but some of the facts suggest that mr capes is rather disappointed at his general reception there is however some reason for his lack of popularity and that is found in his persistent avoidance of the simple and cultivation of the bizarre probably the book which had the best chance of popular favour was his first the lake of wine an admirably romantic narrative which utilised the bizarre deftly his highest effort we should feel disposed to see in  a jay of italy but not one of his romances is easy reading not one but is full of intellectual and emotional strangeness assuredly mr capes will keep his admirers among the elect but he is not likely to be acclaimed by the large public as a favourite his latest tale is illustrative of his strength and weakness it is almost wantonly  odd and its eccentricity is emphasised by the authors style one would like to see simpler things in it and more intelligible motives but one recognises its astonishing cleverness hoping at the same time that mr capes will not like john wisdom forswear the pen in disgust  the green parrot fiction by bernard capes smith elder and co 6s this is a book better executed than planned the plot being flimsy and the superstructure elaborate it concerns a literary pair who part at the churchdoor and are brought together by a brainful smike with a green parrot these people especially the husband are uncomfortable creatures and the glorified smike is almost more uncomfortably ideal the more actual persons are a vulgar legal cad who is drawn with an admirable odiousness and a titled tottie an exmusicalhall artiste who falls in love with the hero and cabals with the cad against the heroine whose marriage lines are kept safely in a dressingbag ready tor emergencies the rows the shocking claws and punches the rival ladies indulge in freely are well described but are better done by pallmall shall when she is being arrested the wooing of the cad is as ugly as it would be in hogarth or the flesh  but the real thrill comes when the seraphic smike parrot in hand is chased through a wood into a dark dank pool smelling of silas marner  and drowned or not drowned  that is the agonising question which the reader will grow warm about mr leveson the good critic with a large heart and a game leg is interesting both as a man and as a picture but he must have been most unhappy to find himself in such an ungentle galley and mr capes seems to think that the writing brotherhood and sisterhood are either nasty and popular or artists and misunderstood and so blamelessly splenetic but to this rule he admits wholesome exceptions this is a view somewhat lacking in the manliness of his friend dr johnson and peculiarly untrue in the matter of the craftsmen of good letters they cannot expect to be understood without rubs and buffets and the lapse of time  but to whine bolt and sulk like the delicate mr hearne is not to play the part of an interesting hero,unmarked

  our manifold nature by sarah grand heinemann the title here is too big for the contents and the preface much too highpitched a great observer of human kind and its exponent through the medium of fiction would have fought shy of a name suggesting so much or if not like balzac would have justified his choice by the strenuous efforts of a lifetime there is something very far wrong when halfadozen second or thirdrate stories representing hardly halfadozen distinct types of human beings out of a world teeming with differences wears such a title unblushingly then why a novelist should ever write a preface is not very comprehensible but at least some care should be taken that it be pitched in the right key this one here is addressed to some not very intelligent critics who have been greatly concerned as to whether the writers methods be artistic she contends so far as we can understand her not altogether coherent words that art is what you like to make it we would respectfully suggest that her theories of art will be of more value when her achievements are a little more and appeal to her to recognise the true direction of her work instead of using the cant of the day and posing as an artist because she writes stories the artists of the world are few the story writers even the good ones many and much needed the great success of the heavenly twins was a fact full of significance which cannot be dismissed flippantly on the ground of the bad taste of the public but its success had nothing to do with artistic reasons how much of it was owing to popular curiosity on subjects which conventional society has hitherto turned away its face from is doubtful some of it was certainly due to the fact of madame grand s distinct capacities for stimulating and leading popular opinion she takes herself and her mission seriously not to say solemnly the first requisite of a teacher she has the courage of her opinions which are not too much in advance of the time to make her a social martyr or a voice crying in the wilderness why then instead of posing as an artist which certainly leads her into affectations does not this really talented writer keep singly in view the work for which she is fitted that of a social reformer but too much about a preface perhaps before coming to the stories  the yellow leaf and  eugenia are both mostly about young women some of whom have madame grands very excellent ideas about morality and who accordingly prosper and one of whom has the conventional idea of society on the subject and comes to a bad end her heroines are exceedingly selfconscious and their stories are a little dull there is not a ray of humour anywhere unless the conversation of the countrywoman of property with the authoress be accounted humorous  and when you write a book do you put in the stops yourself stops and everything oh no not the stops of course  all that must be done for you but if they are neither amusing nor vivid their common sense and their morality are excellent the other stories have no particular motive  boomellen a sketch of a semiidiot is pathetic so are  ah man the tale of a chinese vagabond and janey the history of a lame village girl they have the look of being almost literal reminiscences they are interesting if crude and there is much kindly human nature in them indeed were not the title and the preface there to remind us of unjustifiable pretensions it would be easy to give much more unstinted praise to these halfdozen stories,unmarked

tugeru aram wthat has mr wills made of bulwers idea  what will mr irving make of mr willss version of i eugene aram were questions much mooted when we last glanced at what the theatres were doing they were answered on the seventeenth of april when the new play was produced at the lyceum before a crowded and sympathetic audience with every accessory of scenery decoration and costume which the most fastidious admirer of realism could desire mr wills has made a few interesting tableaux out of what bulwer executed as a romance and conceived as a drama to which he doubted his own ability to do justice but he has not made a good play out of it any more than he reduced the readymade tragedy of the life and death of charles the first to the conditions of a good acting drama mr irving makes the most and the best of m1r willss tableaux but he is overweighted by the disproportion of his part and he has to struggle against the inherent unsuitability of the story of  eugene aram for representation on the stage at all unless it were given in its entirety mr wills claims to have adhered neither to bulwers romance nor to hoods poem and in a certain sense he has written his play independently of either though he has taken some of his effects from both it would however be clearly unreasonable to expect that this play should be considered on its own merits only and not to some degree with regard to its proportion to and relation with bulwers novel to which the murderer of daniel clarke owes his posthumous renown outside the records of the  annual register and the  newgato alendar thus considering it the question is naturally suggested why did not mr wills inspired by bulwers idea of a lonely student possessed by remorse and fear out of which he is only partially beguiled by love and whose fate comes up with him just as he is about to marry a beautiful girl refer to bulwers view of how the subject ought to be treated in a dramatic instead of merely adopting it in its romantic form  he had bulwers own exposition of his notions on this point and he had the  fragment of the drama which bulwer commenced but did not proceed with and they make it clear that the novelist perceived and appreciated the nature and uxtent of the difference between the romantic and the dramatic capabilities of the story of crime and misery which had strongly fascinated his imagination bulwer turned the drama into a romance mr wills has turned the romance into a drama in the face of the novelists careful demonstration of the vital distinction in fact the antagonism between the two the novel takes up the murderers life at the point where it is most adapted for description that is for the reverse of dramatic treatment but the  fragment takes it up at the point at which the dramatic element is in its full force that is when motive is most powerful and action most prompt the  fragment might never have been fashioned into a good play but any play founded upon the life of  eugene aram which departs entirely from the method of the fragment must necessarily fail to be a good play in this instance the dramatic instinct has deserted m1r wills and he supposes the existence of a state of consciousness on the part of the audience such as the novelist has it in his power to iniduce by description digression or suggestion but which it is the dramatists business to create we cannot imagine shakespeare bringing the guilty queen on in the first act in macbeth bemoaning herself and washing her hands in her sleep and then the unravelling of motive and the description of the murder of duncan all done backward in a frenzied soliloquy but we follow the skulking figure of rudge the murderer of his master and of his fellowservant through all the pitiful stress of his dastard fear and his remorse which is never repentance until the author of  barnaby rudge discloses the secret with a sense that the exigencies of romance are adequately observed the failure of this dramatic instinct renders the first situation in mr willss play weak and incongruous why should the marriage of the only daughter of the vicar of an important parish with a village schoolmaster be a matter of rejoicing to everybody the vicar included  only it would appear in order that mr wills may not adopt the reasonable side of ibulwers story of a romantic girls love for a learned recluse not divided from her by a hopeless inequality of station while he equally with lbulwer does depart from the fact that euene aram had a wife living at the time of his detection in the revelation to his wife of arams crimeits motive and its perpetration having been made plain to the audience by a prologuethere would have teen an opportunity for the exhibition of true dramatic power in both author and actor an opportunity far more worthy than the declamatory incoherent selfaccusation at the feet of a bewildered girl to whom her moody lover has ever been a problem imposed upon mr irving in a scene impressive indeed demanding the utmost exercise of the actors peculiar skill but which elicits no spontaneous response apart from the tribute of admiration due to that skill because it is untrue to the facts to nature and to the previous indications of the piece in the soliloquy which follows the entrance of eugene aram it is certainly implied to the audience that the remorseful man is in love for the first time in his dark and mysterious life and one of the strongest points of analogy between mr willss play and bulwers romance consists in the conviction entertained by ruth meadows that she is eugenes first love just as a similar conviction delights and satisfies the sentimental madeleine lester of the novel but this theory maintained to the end in the one instance is abandoned in the other in a fashion which is destructive to the ideal of the murderers character as it is put forth in the first scenes it is difficult to believe that the play was written otherwise than piecemeal that the story of the motive for the murder of clarkewhich is neither that imagined by bulwer nor that which really actuated eugene aramwas not concocted for the purposes of the concluding scene so discordant is it with all that precedes it the defect of the play as a composition is the absence of any indication of a previously or actually existing passion in the man to whose past so terrible a history attaches which can explain or account for that history like bulwer mr wills rejects the view of eugene aram as a common thief and assassin but he displays nothing like equal skill in the substitution of a supposed motive for the real one bulwer went as near to the palliation of the murder committed by the schoolmaster as the ingenious representation of an idee fire a devouring passion for learning and the revolt of a gloomy morbidly selfconscious mind against the poverty which fettered all its movements could enable him to go in the  fragment as well as in the novel but mr wills following neither has failed to explain the eugene aram who comes upon the scene a melancholy man indeed but whose melancholy according to his own subsequent explanation of its cause would have barred the approaches of the passion of love that ilulwers eugene aram should have possessed an emancipating angel in madeleine lester is intelligiblehis crime had nothing to do with a woman that mr willss eugene aram should have fallen in love with the parsons daughter is inconceivable his crime having been inspired by the base deception of a woman and his remorse kept alive if he could have forgotten the woman and the crime well and good but he never does forget and the discord makes the whole thing unreal the want of dramatic proportion affects the other characters as well they have no individuality apart from their relation to eugene aram parson meadows is a singularly credulous not to say silly old gentleman with an accommodating indifference to social distinctions which we are inclined to believe was less common in england in the last century than it is in this and so deficient in perception that he could hardly claim with hamlet to know a hawk from a handsaw considering the facility with which he invites houseman one of the most ruffianly ruffians ever produced upon any stage to join the family party on the day before the wedding of his daughter dr primrose is a smart man compared with mr willss parson who has a number of pretty speeches to deliver about arams gentleness and tendt ress about his putting the worm in his path into a place of safety releasing imprisoned birds and winning his pupils hearts they are very pretty speeches indeed there is a good deal of prettiness in the play and a little real poetrybut the gentleness and tenderness of eugene aram have to be taken for granted he is from first to last under the absolute dominion of remorse his love is more full of self pity than of passion his self absorption does not yield to the wouldbe joyous influence of the occasion while yet there is nothing to excite the ever latent fear in his breast it is difficult by the way to conceive a more inconvenient fatherinlaw elect than mr meadows for a man whose dread of the mere passing presence of a  stranger  is so great that the mention of the arrival of such a person suffices to distract his attention from the pretty protestations of his bride on the eve of their wedding here again mr wills while adhering to a portion of bulwers conception of the situation neglects a material constituent in it the murderer in the romance knows who it is who is lurking about threatening to reveal his secret to boland lester but the murderer in the play displays terror at the extremely natural occurrence that it stranger has introduced himself to the notice of the vicar of knaresborough and yet he is wholly unprepared to find that the stranger is houseman his former accomplice again in the story of the dreaded and threatened exposure mr wills is in accord to a certain extent with bulwer but not far enough bulwers aram is a comparatively rich man at all eventshe is in a position to make the coarser villains scheme of clhantage feasible but the village schicolmaster who is going to marry the parsons daughter has no money to be bullied out of and is a likelier subject for the tactics of conciliation which has an eye to the future the concluding scenes which are unlike either the novel or the facts are constructed entirely with regard to the characteristics of mr irvings acting they are made for him as exclusively as his costume is made for him and they become him as well this is in this particular case interesting but it is not drama and in the end we believe it is a system which will be found to be as injurious to the actor as it is unjust to the dramatist it is the most infallible method of encouraging mannerism that could be pursued not mannerism in the higher sense of characteristic conception and rendering but the mannerism which is as often as not mere affectation and which lends itself readily to the purposes of burlesque it dispenses the principal actor in a liece from the finer kind of observation while it taxes his energies in one direction it leaves a whole set of faculties without demand upon them in another it tends to drive him into exaggeration on the one hand and on the other into the carelessness which comes from the absence of comparison and by placing every one else at a disadvantage it deprives him of legitimate assistance pieces made to order in this way are to true dramatic writing just what zuccheros pictures were to really artistic portrait painting in the present instance to only one person besides eugene aram is any interest even supposed to attach it is to ruth meadows his betrothed a part by no means illplayed by miss isabel bateman but hopelessly ineffective because endowed with no vitality except that of the circumstances inconsistent and unnatural because ruth is merely a reflet of eugene arams moods and characteristics bulwer took care to establish an interest in his readers minds for madeleine lester to depict her in strongly individual colours and to sketch her life and associates before he plunged her into the deadly peril of love for an undetected criminal to tell all about her enthusiasm her lofty visionary mind and the studentfancies she holds as faith but that a parsons daughter whom we meet as an ingenue presiding over a village choir lauded by her gardener as the household angel a being of white muslin blue ribbons poetry and posies should mingle the most innocent and orthodox piety with a declaration that if eugene arams hand were even stained with crime she would still regard him with the passionate worship which he has inspired is unnatural and unpleasant not only or chiefly because the sentiment is at variance with every principle on which her life has been trained with every other to which she gives expression but because there is no reason for its suggestion except the authors absorption in eugene arams supposed state of mind and his inability to shift himself to that of any other person however comparatively important in the drama so as to give consistency or vitality to the other characters it is no wonder that miss isabel bateman is artificial and constrained all through she has a most unmanageable lover to deal with one so totally selfengrossed that she is made to appear as she must feel an interruption whenever she is not merely a chorus and the fact is that the only real chance she gets of producing any effect of signifticance is during the brief interval when eugene aram is off the stage in his case also by far the most effective scene is that in which he is quite alone when in the churchyard the murderer in his unbearable agony of remorse makes abject confession to heaven the dramatist puts forth the best that is in him the sense of interruption and incompleteness is lost in that solemn scene full of breathless interest the solitude of the guilty soul isolated by its incommunicable grief is broken by the only commune which has no discord in it and for the first time the legitimate condition for the employment of crime as a motive of dramatic action the inspiring of pity and of fear is fully attained mr henry irvings acting in the character of eugene aram is quite up to public expectation he plays the part with wonderful minuteness elaboration of detail and variety of expression considering the limited range of the emotion and its terrible profundity the slight demand for subtlety in the earlier scenes because every one is perfectly willing to be deceived and the complete surrender of the later scenes in which the presence of houseman in one and that of iruth meadows in another is of no practical account he is unreasonably suspicious and uneasy and preoccupied all through the first scene with ruth but that is the fault of the text he has to interpret  the fine touches in the interpretation the despairing glance over the girls head as it lies on his breast the vague absent smile and the lapse into thought far away from her even while the love words are on his lips and the caressing hands are touching her the writhing under the torture of praise and love in the address from his pupils as it is inflicted by the lips of his bride the shrinking from the pretty details of the weddingall these are his own in the agony and terror of detection in the morbid dread of the poor remains of the man he has slain in his dreadful question to houseman  diditstir  throughout the whole of the concluding scenes mr irving displays increasing power and intensity of expression but the situations are unduly prolonged and in the concluding scene in the churchyard he has too much ground to cover it is impossible to follow him through the contortions of that final agony without feeling that physical effort has too much place in it that it is suffered to divide the attention of the audience with the terrible mental struggle destined to end in utter defeat and death in a proportion which injures the effect of the whole in that one instance only the play is better than the interpretation the words are faultless the action is overdone many other passages of considerable beauty adorn mr willss play but they do not suffice to rescue it from the sentence of mediocrity as a dramatic composition that it is very much better than many plays with which the public have been satisfied of late years is not weighty evidence in favour of either the play or the public but we are far from accepting  eugene aram as the best that mr wills can do the author of  medea and the man o airlie and even of charles the first with all its faults as a drama ought to produce lieces which certain actors should aspire to perform not only pieces which aspire to be percormed by certain actors in the inversion of the roles of dramatist and actor there is the decadence of both arts,unmarked

otherwise miss viola paget is far too well known to require to be dealt with at length the present volume of vanitas polite stories which the authoress describes as sketches of frivolous women is a second edition in which has been included a new story entitled a frivolous conversion the heroine madame nitzenko middleaged commonsensible charming sarcastic kindly and russian is one of a party stopping at the engadiner hof her vishvis is count kollonitz a young man of the world who has done everything and seen everything and who has worked out for himself a kind of philosophy of life which can be turned and twisted to suit his present mood from the depths of an armchair madame nitzenko riddles his philosophy with her common sense and pricks his overweening vanity with her sharp tongue little by little however the young count loses his first dislike of her seeks her out and discusses life and its component parts the charm and value of the story lie in the psychology and characterisation the atmosphere is bright and gay and the various philosophies under discussion are treated with the light and skilful pen which miss paget knows so well how to wield the second heroine created by miss rhoda broughton is of quite a different mould though by some strange coincidence the action of the story takes place in a similar milieu the devil and the deep sea is the name of the book and it must be read from cover to cover all by herself lonely and shrinking from attention this young girl sits among the flexes her face stamped with the lines of suffering she thinks of the past with horror and fright and is only recalled to the possibilities of the present and future by the sight of a man in even worse plight than herself battered and broken lying helplessly in an invalid chair in the golden sunlight her sorrow is partially obliterated by the sight of his and pity for his loneliness makes her do little things for him in spite of his rudeness and obvious detestation of being noticed at all she finds out that he too has a past which it is his one object in life besides that of getting well to keep secret this mutual tie draws her sympathies still more and she protects him from the importunities of the other visitors in the hotel step by step she overcomes his timidity and reserve in a charmingly unassuming manner and compels him to look upon her as a friend until at last they both discover to their fright that love has ousted friendship from their hearts he is forced by outside circumstances to confess his secret past and she forces herself by the strength of her love to open her skeletoncupboard to his view what is inside it would be unfair to disclose but it is well worth reading the book to find out the dramatic surprise reserved for the last few chapters is a surprisea thing which is rare miss broughtons characters are all alive and human though we think it would make for more enjoyable and fluent reading if she would boldly write  dont  shant etc instead of the oldfashioned forms  do not you shall not you the little sketch of the family who also share the hotel with the heroine is most refreshing and amusing the sudden drama and tragedy is so unexpected that it is not until one has read the last line of the last page that one can appreciate the full meaning of the title mr e m sneydkynnersleys heroine makes her debut as a mountain climber in the alps the book labours under the title of  a snails wooing seeing that the heroine met the snail in august for the very first time and that the aforesaid molluscous animal proposed to her in the september following we do not think that there is justice or even propriety in the title we suppose that in the mountains they have change tout cela be that as it may the heroine whose name though cordelia  might have been goneril or yerenhappuck is a delicious young girl bubbling over with enthusiasm and delight at seeing and doing new things the possessor of an angelic singing voice and guaranteed to cause a disturbance in the heart of the most ferocious bachelor she carries all before herguides experienced climbers edelweiss and mountains she writes the most breezy and amusing letters to a girl friend at home and at last in spite of the attentions of a priggish oxford don weds the snail who is a cheery matteroffact sportsman who thoroughly deserves her mr sneydkynnersley has written an admirable book the most fanatical climbers have charming and realistic descriptions of their beloved mountains and the toils and dangers to be endured bef ore bagging them to quote the authors phrase those who have no experience of the alps will assuredly find themselves longing to follow in the tracks of the snail and the heroine and capture for themselves the wonders and beauties peculiar to the vast snowclad peaks in switzerland the author is possessed of a keen sense of humour which he has not sought to repress and the pages of this delightful book team with the spirit of fun till laughter voiceless through excess waves mute appeal and sore above the midriffs deep distress for breath to laugh once more we do not desire to convey that our condition at every page was such as is described in kiplings  necessitarian  the book would be extremely painful if such were the casebut the author is so sudden and unexpected at times that we were compelled to give way the fourth heroine is madame la duchesse de chevreuse intriguerinchief to anne of austria wife of louis xiii of france a woman whose heart was bigger than her head who compelled the admiration and service of all who had the good fortune to come in contact with her a certain period of the life of an english gentlemanan enormous giant of a man who cares for nothing save physical adventure and who sleeps with his sword by his pillowwhich is bound up with her interests is the groundwork for an excellent quasihistorical novel of the stanleyweyman type the presence of the great cardinal looming in the background and incidentally drawn on the cover with the vacillations of louis and his brother throw up into strong relief the more or less pathetic figures of anne and the duchesse surrounded by their friends fighting against overwhelming odds scheming plotting and intriguing by day and night under the shadow of the bastillethe huge englishman quick of brain strong of arm and clever of sword finds the intrigues amusing and only requires to be attracted by the beautiful marie de rohan now duchesse de chevreuse to throw his lot in heart and soul with the losing side the story of his adventures and the share he has in the fight against richelieu make up mr humfrey jordans novel entitled  my lady of intrigue it is admirably constructed and the interest is sustained throughout we like the englishman for his blunt common sense and with him feel sympathy for the defeated woman the sketches of richelieu gaston the kings brother anne of austria and many other wellknown historical personages of less note are skilfully and interestingly drawn and the exciting and adventurous elements in the book are told with none of the flamboyant  word painting  and excess in which so many of the historical novelists indulge we do not know mr humfreyjordans name as the author of other novels and if this is his first attempt he is to be congratulated upon an

bessy rane by mrs henry wood 3 vols london bentley never did author embark upon the troubled waves ot literature under more favourable circumstances than did mrs henry wood her first productions were brilliant successes the channings and east lynne areeven yetimpressedupon our memories as amongst the most entertaining and lifelike of novels the channings especially opened quite a fresh field to storylovers its chief excellence lying in the fact that it forsook the worn tracts of ordinary romance and came nearer home readers fancied that theyllad met the channings out of the pages of the novel in ordinary social intercourse and no book was given with greater confidence into the hands of children by parents than the channings there was a high social tone pervading its pages the characters were not immaculate but real living beings whose alternate shades of darkness and light both in their dispositions and worldly vicissitudes might have found their types in many a pure elevated english household east lynne was not by any means so pure an example but it had very high excellences there was but little that was overstrained the episodes were startling but they were not improbable thecharacters had very decided human weaknesses but they wvere not put forward in an offensive light but rather toned down to meet possible prejudices many objected to certain incidents being incorporated into the story the elopement of the doctors wife through jealousy was not a pleasant subject but the incident is not an uncommon one in ordinary life and it was carefully handled the concluding incidents were the most faulty in the story the return of the first wife in disguise to find another in her place and to be compelled to conceal her identity was rather an awkward conception which although it was got rid of by her speedy death left a most uncomfortable conclusion to the story it had been well for mrs henry woods reputation if she had tried to improve such defects in her style as appearel in her first works  and instead of treating her popularity as a mere commercial speculation to earn money had steadily set herself to study the art of fiction instead of this she has poured from the press a perfect stream of 3 vol novels each wvorse than its predecessor with every first fault magnified and numerous fresh ones added unto them until she has disgraced the fair name which was originally so proud an heritage into that ofwe say it advisedlya most dangerous writer airs henry wood seems to imagine that when a little bubble reputation has been once gained any combination of rubbish that may contain a dash of sensationalisma sprinkling of goodygoody talk a deathbed scene and some intricate plot will be accepted by the english public as well worth perusal so long as it emanates froin the same pen as its predecessor she seems to imagine that it is impossible to obliterate by your own wilful carelessness and ignorance of the limits which are generally allowed inl plot and circumstance to writers who have earned the respect of the public every pretension to being called a good and honest author we consider her last two novelsnamely  george canterburys will and  bessy rane as fit only to rank amongst the most inferior of sensation novels there is a bad moral tone pervading them throughout the atmosphere is unhealthy and not all the cant talk with which they are overlaid can conceal it we do not care to give a sketch of the story we leave it to those who read a story with all the greater avidity which receives adverse criticism from the press but we will insert two specimens of a new style which appears in mrs henry woods novels for the first time and leave the general public to judge for themselves it is dickens oliver twist

the tents of wickedness by miriam coles harris sidney appleton this story may be fairly described as a lineal descendant with modern developments of the novels of e p roe so far as method is concerned the outlook is as ingenuously provincial and the composition of the narrative as artless as in  barriers burnt away and other works from the same pen a theological novel may easily have points of interest provided that the author brings a certain measure of accomplishment to the writing  but 4 the tents of wickedness in spite of several lurid glimpses into their deplorable recesses remains frankly tedious the story is extremely episodic and concerns the fortunes of a fair young girl who fresh from twelve years of convent life is thrown by a careless parent into the vulgar vortex of what appears to be intended for smart society but the outstanding motive of the work is of a sectarian character,unmarked_contra

fiction montes the matador and other stories by frank harris grant richards 6s the author of elder conklin employs in all his fiction the device of what we would call  simple narration a device used by balzac and turgenev but not we think by any other great european novelist of the nineteenth century not even strangely enough by de maupassant the user of this device may be deemed to adopt the following attitude toward his reader   see here i have some very curious and interesting facts to tell you and i will relate them straightforwardly without embroidery and with only such explanations and descriptions as are absolutely necessary i merely want you to get hold of the facts indeed you must listen to them because they have interested me tremendously and i am sure they will interest you whatever you do dont mistake me for a romancer a concocter of stories now just listen and i wont waste your time  there now wasnt that worth hearing  true  of course it is true that is why i wished you to hear it such an attitude and such a method employed with skill and discretion are enormously effective in the way of vraisemblance and vraisemblance is esteemed by novelists the highest quality of narrative art it isntno one ever imagined that paradise lost was truebut that is another and a larger question there are five stories in mr harriss volumetwo rather slight and unequal to the three larger onesand each leaves you with the impression that the events told did actually occur the best tale is the first one the lovestory of an old espada told like most of the others in the first person it is a sinister and powerful recital and the bullfighting lore comes out of the mouth of old montes in a very natural and convincing manner  profit and loss  is a tale of kansas citymr harriss cosmopolitanism amounts almost to an affectationand the theme is an arson committed by an employee at the instigation of his employer the reward being the latters daughter the analysis of the criminals feelings after the crime is one of the best things in the book  he realised that all efforts were in vain that nothing could check the fire that his work was done completely and then remorse came upon him at first with a vague sense of loss nuch as one feels in missing the familiar and accustomed later with the full understanding of waste and destruction as acutely keen regret    the last story  sonia is russian and very obviously it has been composed at the feet of ivan turgenev mr harris could not have gone to a better master but nevertheless sonia is only a clever imitation the episode of the assassination of alexander ii is here used with singular dramatic effect the book as a whole is capable but mr harriss careless way of writing english will prevent him from taking so high a place as he might otherwise have occupied  montes thc matador aud other stories short storiei by frank harris g richardsthere are two excellent stories in this book the first and though one called first love a confession  montes the matador is tiie story of a great matadors love and hate but it is chiefly remarkable for the wonderful descriptions of bullfighting which occur in it mr harris not only must havo seen and enjoyed the sport but he makes his readers see it enter into though spirit of it and admire the excitement the wonderful escapes and the combined daring and skill of good bulllighters whether cspada banderillo or ehulo as a dramatic description of the great spanish tport by a lover of it this could not lie bettered she sordid aspect and the cruelty are left out of sightbut that is right for the matador who tells the story would not see them  he sees only the glorious excitement and the art of it ho even reveals a sort of love for the bulls whom he kills which comes from his intimate knowlodge of their character and their differences the story too which he tellshot passionate and cruelseems to flt exactly with the atmosphere to which it belongs in its way this tale is perfect tliero is not a jarring touch in it it is simply a bit of spanish life  first love is good also though it does not seem so inevitable as the first story lt is the description of the calflove of a very young girl for a quite ordinary young man to whom she attaches all manner of heroic qualities she linds that she can attract him against his will but knowing that ho does not love her she goes away and delilerately kills her passion he meets her years afterwards when he is prosperously married hears the story from her and is sorry at what he missed the conscientious vulgarity and stupidity of the young man on the stock exchange are admirably indicated in his own jmrrative of though events mr harris by the way shows great skill in allowing the unimaginative young englishman honourable but terribly commonplace to reveal himself unconsciously in describing his love affairs it is just the same type of man this time a budding mp who plays the second rule in the last story  sonia his ijewildorment and almost unwilling attraction on meeting a young woman ol unconventional ideas are very well suggested by his falling in love with her chiefly because she is a mystery to him and his very evident though shamefaced relief when he leaves her to consort with his correct young friends in the diplomatic service nevertheless sonia herself is not quite convincing and still less is though hero of profit and loss this is an otherwise delightful study in irony but it is spoilt by our inability to believe that david tryon would ever really have committed the crime he is here represented to have perpetrated altogether it is a book which proves mr harris to be in the first rank ot shortstory tellers  notes on novels these notes on the weevs fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow montes the matador by frank harris three books stand to mr frank harriss name elder conklin und other stories which was received with considerable

fiction abbots ferney by u macaulay murray 6s r macaulay has written an interesting book her work is sound and careful and illumined by occasional flashes of insight its chief defect is an inclination to diffuseness and her characters at times become dim and even lost in the fog of detail and explanation  its chief quality is absolute sincerity the story is simple and reasonable relying for interest as such a story should upon the play of circumstance on character the three generations of ruths are realised and expressed with admirable distinctness the misery of verney ruth when he becomes involved in the disgrace of his father and is disinherited by his grandfather is finely described and his pride his sensitive reserve his pluck are brought out with great skill though wear unable to sympathise as we seem expected to with his resentment against rosamond for not giving him all when by her strength and kindness she had already given him much we read the book with the interest that real sincerity almost always commands the authors prose is usually good  occasionally it is distressingly harsh as when she writes of  phlegmatic practicality but happily such phrases are rare and we recommend the book without hesitation,unmarked_contra

the son of the wolf by jack london isbister 63 we notice in the advertisements of a god of his fathers a previous work of the authors appended to the present volume that a critic remarks it is no exaggeration to say that mr london does for the klondyke what mr rudyard kipling has done for india a reading of the son of the wolf leaves us with the conviction that mr rudyard kipling need be under no uneasiness mr jack londons tales are all  vigorous his men are all muscular heroes his language his style his situations all have the ideal and the downright virtues of muscularity so far so good but we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where mr jack london fails we do not wish to disparage in any way the son of the wolf the nine tales of which the book is made up are healthy breezy narratives of sensational incidents in the  worthland scruff mackenzie goes on the trail seeking a wife braves a whole tribe of indians kills two men and carries off the beautiful zarinska the chiefs daughter xaass an alentian chief travels thousand of miles from the behring sea tracking axel gunderson a modern norse sea rover who has carried off from him the peerless unga of course he lures gunderson and unga to a trackless wilderness in search of a gold mine and of course they die in the most melodramatic fashion the best story in the book is to the man on the trail because it is the least theatrical  in a far country  is a tale with the same motive as  an outpost of progress  by mr joseph conrad to compare the manner in which the two authors bring the same situation before us is to see why mr jack london cannot be called an artist he is a vigorous story teller for the general publicwhich is not a bad thing but his sphere scarcely touches that of those writers who like mr rudyard kipling have created a manner and a method of presentation which is all their own  lhovel lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum

bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely

alice lorraine alice lorraine a tale of the south downs by r d blackmore author of  the maid of sker c london sampson low and co mr blackmore almost makes us breathe the healthful air of the south downs in the pages of this novel we rise refreshed and inspirited fiom the perusal of these three enticing volumesa result which has become so unusual latterly with readers of works of fiction as the story ran through the pages of blackwood it had many admirers and it is not too much to say that mr blackmore has never produced superior work in ilorna doone there were more striking passages of natural description possibly and in  the maid of sker there was at least one character of more intense individuality but the present novel is remarkable for its general merit given unquestionable genius at the outsetwhich mr blackmore possesseswe should expect an author to ripen in this manner so that his work while it may not impress us for the force of any single attribute will leave upon us a very distinct idea of power that a novel should be styled a worthy suc cessor to the two works we have just named is no mean tribute yet it is one which we are able to pay on the present occasion in the fullest and frankest manner one point has especially struck us in relation to the present story and that is the utter lack of straining after effect either by a spasmodic brilliancy of style or sensationalism of plot the gentleman and the scholar are alike perceptible in every chapter and we are never in a state of dubiety as to the healthy morality he would teach of absolute flinging of moral lessons at the head of the reader there is indeed very little but the whole might very well be placed before the hysterical and sensuous school who having gratified the lower passions of their readers throw an occasional sop to the almighty by patronising religion the true end of the novelist mr blackmore always keeps in viewnamely that of telling the unvarnished history of any character he undertakes to depict one incident at the close of his latest story would in other hands have appeared unreal and grotesque but the author has so manipulated it that it adds to the effect of his work the lorraines of coombe lorraine were a very old family possessing undoubted records of their abode in the land for centuries there was always from the time of baronets either a sir roland sir hilary or sir roger lorrainenames which were never strayed from for the head of the race the present baronet when the story opens in 1811 was sir roland he had an only son hilary and an only daughter alice

course of love ends oz returning to coombe lorraine hilary endeavours to persuade his father in favour of mabel sir roland owever will not permit him to descant upon her numerous virtues and concludes

is open hilary avails himself of the parental suggestion and goes off to the war in the peninsula as he finds he cannot give up his love for the growers daughter the young recruit covers himself with glory at ciudad rodrigo and other places and becomes very popular with all the fellows in his regiment on one occasion he gets desperately wounded and is tended during his illness by the lovely daughters of the count of zamora one of these goes very near wounding him deeply in the region of the heart and he does not get released from his entanglement except at a very severe cost she is the

given to the lorraines by her father and hersolf and alice and hilary are thus both savedthe former to marry major aylmer a brave british officer and the latter to reconcile sir roland to his union

intelligent person making no pretensions to a higher character its merit can be best shown by extract and we shall proceed at once to introduce it to our readers our first notice will be confined to greece mr stephens for that it now appears is the name of the writer after a ramble among the ionian islands embarked with two companions for pad ra s but was driven into missilonghi where he first set foot mi the classic soil  among all the desperadoes lie observes  clio ever landed there none were more destitute and in better condition to go ahead than i for i had all that i wius worth on my

mine put me above porters and customhouse officers and while my companions were busy with these plagues of travellers i paced vith great satisfaction the shore of greece though i am obliged to confess that this satisfaction as for reasons utterly disconnected with any recollections nt lier ancient glories business before pleasure one of our first inquiries was for a breakfast perhaps if we had seen a monument or solitary column or ruin of any kind it would have inspired us to better things but there was nothing absolutely rothing that could recall an image of the past besides we did not expect to land at missilonghi and were not bound to be inspired at a place into which we were thrown by accident and more than all 1 drizzling rain was penetrating to our very bones we were wet and cold and what can men ii in the way of sentiment when their teeth are chattering missilonghi is well known by description t least to most englishmen for it was there that byron died almost the first questions i ask ed says our traveller  were about the poet and it added to the dreary interest which the pince inspired to listen to the mininer in which the greeks spoke of him it ingilt lie thought that here on the spot where he breathed his last malignity would have held her accurod tongue hut it was not so he bael committed the fault unpardonable in the eyes ot political opponents of attaching himself to one of theteal parties that then divided reece and though he had given her all that man could give in his own dying words  his time his means his health and lastly iis litethe greeks spoke of him wili all the rancur and bitterness of party spirit even death had lot won oblivion for his political offences and i heard those who saw him die in lier cause affirm that fyron was no friend to greece

when attempting to sj eal a foreign language and we could not talk to her on commit themes our lips were sealed of course upon the  object which had brought us to her house we could not sound for her the praises of her gallant father at parting however i told them that the name of marco iwzaris was as familiar in america as that of a hero of our own revolution and that it had been hallowell by the

nearly five hundred  and when we entered the huge room and the scholars all rose in a body to greet us as americans i felt a deep sense ot regret that personally i had no hand in such a work and almost envied the feelings of my companion one of its patrons and founders   hut the principal and most interesting part of this missionary school was the female department under the direction of mrs hill the first and except at syra the only school for females in all greece an 1 particularly interesting to nie from the fact that it owed its existence to the active benevolence of my own countrywomen at the close of the jreek revolution female education was a thing entirely unknown in greece and the women of all classes were in a most deplorable state of ignorance when the strong fee

whose wisdom courage beneficence subtlety and taste exercise a powerful charm over the inhabitants of x the town in which he practises the heroine is an inscrutable teacher in a ladies boardingschool who happens to be called down to speak to the physician when he is summoned to attend a sick pupil dr sarona on seeing miss dudleigh perceives that she herself is in great perilon the verge of a brain feverand at once brings her to his house and domesticates her there with his perfect sister salome thus begins the tale  and the characters and incidents through which it leads us are in perfect correspondence with the probabilities of its commencement six miles from x there lives by the side of the sea a young poetvery rich very childish and very wayward he is a darling friend of dr saronas and on miss dudleigh making his acquaintance she is smitten to the heartall x including miss sarona imagining the while that she and the doctor are about  to make a match of it so far from this being the case dr sarona is about the same time fatally wounded by the charms of miss rose de bern a protegee of miss dudleighs which lady the young poet bernard marries but it apears afterwards that the young poet would lave preferred to marry miss dudleigh rather than hose and had only refrained from trying to win the former because he imagined that the doctor was in love with her we have given the merest possible skeleton of this case of delicate distress  the combinations of selfsacrifice and misunderstanding with which it is filled up being too numerous for present recital what has been said moreover will in no respect forestall the close of the story it is told in even wilder and more gorgeous language than its predecessor and of this we will give a specimen or two lest we be thought critical without just cause redhaired ladiesthe ladies lake and the viscount windermere their brother who appeared to be exteiiding over them a haughty yet serene superintendence had all red hair a

lustrous seagreen in its grey was lost and the look became more like a crouching leopards than that of a man and a poet with a soft fierceness and subtle detestation which can only be so described nor was the similitude destroyed by the smile that divided the lips and through their mysterious parting showed the glitter of teeth like snowa bluish white rather than pearly ivory the victim all unconsciously was gathered to the spell stern as she was and scarcely womanhearted she was bowed to the bending expressionnot approach a wonderful facealready his faceso sarthe clearer when absent

those unheard whispers of the touch which men call kisses that exalted almost unnatural ecstacy which lifts the martyr into insufferable calm  which presses on the dying like a sea of lightwrapped folded interpenetrated lier she never was with sarona whose spiritual nature was unsheathed instead of shaded by the spell of presence hut she remembered the one expression of his love now withholden from his glance now iced beneath his smile but which once had dawned in a moment that stretched throughout eternity the above are only three among a thousand similar passages that could be cited yet in the midst of all this clotted nonsense to avail ourselves of johnsons phrase the just reader will find that there is somewhat of power and passion imbedded the writer has wrought inself up into believing that such fine language is deep and real but not as sometimes happens in like cases out of poverty so much as out of perversity there is genuine selfdelusion in his frenzy we imaginenot conscious imposture could he prevail on himself to respect the modest boundaries of common sense he might become a good novelist whereas should a third tale outdo  counterparts as far as  counterparts outdoes its predecessor tia case must be given up as one of hopeless disease past the power even of so omnipotent a philanthropist as dr sarona to relieve  counterparts or the crou of love by the author of charles auchester smith elder and co 65 cornhill the plot of this novel is somewhat flimsy in structure and is rather devoid of interest nor is it interspersed with powerfully delineated dramatic scenes calculated to rise vividly before the imagination of the reader the three volumes are chiefly filled by long monotonous dialogues between persons whose characters have little affinity with those by whom the world is really peopled dr herz sarona the chief medical adviser of the inhabitants of h is the perfect character of the book superior to all around him he overawes them by his manners his judgement never errs nor does he ever desert the path of duty attending a case of brain fever in a school his keen perceptive faculty leads him to discover that miss dudleigh the music teacher is a genius whose brain must infallibly succumb under the effects of overtaxation if the be not removed he makes arrangements with his sister to receive her in their house as an inmate miss

pulsation seemed to have gone down into her wrist and up into hor dazzled brain she knew exactly how long to bear it and that she could not bear it long she suddenly drew back her hand very quietly and softly and said in a hushed voice 44 that is quite enough i think i am to be of no moro use than the rest sarona gave a sharp start as from a celestial incubus roseturned quickly and was about to speak then as sharply he turned back upon bose and stared 44 just look at bernard everybody was looking even lord federne who had taken a fresh observation was transfixed in the opening of the door mossmoor in boywonder kept smiling up at salome she could not smile she was too absorbed for bernard outstretched upon the sofa had sunk lower and lower until he lay as if in bed one arm was thrown over his forehead and the rosy palm of that hand lay open like a shell the fingers were relaxed as an infants his face was suffused with the blush of slumber the warm blood so seldom gathered to the cheek except in childhood tinted far more than usual his somewhat eallid lips its frequent frown had melted from the foreead the mouth was just open enough to show the glimmer of the teeth above all most strange to say the eyes were closedclosed with no flutter ot the lidsno quiver of the eyelash from the feet crossed carelessly to the calm of the soft dark hair all wai at rest with bernard miss dudleigh had never moved since she first assumed her seat she stiu looked at him but not so rigidly and now in place of her stonelike paleness her cheeks were slightly flushed she felt sarona behind her for he advanced on tiptoe and without moving her head she whispered 44 is it not strange  i cannot understand it myself 44 it is most wonderful and yet does not surprise me you succeeded better than i did 44 oh that is only because i did not try to do so much i only wanted to make him sleep and i know i could i resolved i thought of nothing else 44 and yet you could do more i am persuaded

not do bim any harm as it would if he became comatose and then moss fetched his father and federne brought mrs delapole nothing could convince this lady that it was any hut an everymght sleep sarona did not try to convince her neither did anybody else and yet through all the talking and laughing that followed bernard did not wake he slept for quite an hour in that entranced position never moving his lips nor closing his open hand not till sarona declared he must bo gone did cecilia set herself to wake him and strange to say it was not so easy she looked at him a long time before he even stirred and then t was impatiently pettishly  he rubbed his fingers into his eyes and opened them  staredrubbed them again  frowned darkly the spanish gloom passing as a cloud upon the rose of slumbersat up and looked halfcuriously halfcross at sarona and called at him  what the devil have you been doing to me    been doing to you  tou have been chained as fast as before you were born

tor bernard hourly augmenting he too is struck by the beauty of cecilias music thb powxk ot music it may be supposedand is we believe by the musically uninitiated who fancy they have fathomed its remotest significancethat all music is exciting it is not so to the musical music is the only calmthe only restthe one idea of heaven which is the essence of things longed for the soul expanded overpowered with though presence of jehovah as he revealed himself in that ancient shrine where his shadow was lightthe tranced folds of sacred raiment about the sacerdotal feetwere not more still of more serenity in their repose than the musician fully gifted with the conception and the revelation of tone his only worship there is excitement until the highest ecstasy is attained the element of that enthusiasm which lifts the soul on wings to god but never afterwards but for music to be exciting it must bear relation to our humanitymust simulate our pains and pleasuresmust humour us by reminiscence yea even from the loftiest type of regular dramatic illustration to its lowest form a rhythmical association of sound with motion there is in fact no music so physically and merely exciting as music written for the dance but it does not follow that all dancesymphonies excite all persons bernards temperamentthe susceptible alt music for the dance excited saronasthe impressible seldom any but for once he was to be touched tonight standing by federne and resolving as a duty to aleud and listen outwardsneither to take notice nor to hear the beatings of his heart within himhe first became aware that he had never heard a measure so strange before his memory was first aroused as cecuias had been in writing by the dream in the deeps of ages gone and passed awaywhich bernards words in their youngest poetry had evolved as by another musicthe dreams of forms forgotten when giants were upon our islandearth and left thrir footsteps on our sandsthe dream ot midnight with white pillars meteorwreathed and no templeroof but the starry vaultthe dream of that awful march whose tramp shook garlands darkly scatteredthe streaming stores like snowreefsthe hands that moved upon dread harps like virginflame the pompous stirtie unknown ritethe secret words and then as lt had been with cecuia thc mythic marvel passed and another mood succeeded she had poured her whole passion into those notes the fabulous phantasm but beguiled as a veiling mist upon the mountain the chords broke pitilessly upon the heart when the brain had received its impression the pulses answered it was like the repinings of lost lovethe daint of wandering fancy sarona was obliged to go on istenmg having once given way impatiently ho longed for the strain to close it seemed remorselessly to extend it held him fast in its undulating spellit mocked with sweetness that soothed him not but that he felt through though toils of the harmony as she had felt it while she wove the sounds m solitude and it affected others too for bernard it was the witchcraft of a will far wider than his own its grave yet bounteous measure made him at once understand what he had felt and feel it more utterly and as in feeling most and meaning to express it he was most unlike sarona under strong exoitement so in this expressiob he became more like him in his medium moments bernard calls on sarona to announce his intended marriage with miss de berri and seeks to persuade herz to offer his hand to cecilia dudleigh after bernards marriage dr saronas parents come to stay with him and frequent and long are the conversations on temperaments between cecilia and the father of herz miss dudleigh goes to rockedge to stay with the bernards the semblance of pride and contempt which had hitherto lain between her and ralph is dispelled and they converse as friends one lovely summers evening they go out in a small boat on the seaalone too late he drew his oars in laid them down glistening like gathered reeds and stepped across the seat it was the only one between them and he sat down on it slowly close before her she drew the mantle from his hands and flung it round her  one end splashed down into the sea and she turned to reach it but bernard caught it first and wrapped it carefully and closely to her breast leaning towards her looking at her with his most serious expression  a gravity terrible upon such a face so long he looked he leaned that she raised her eyes and fixed them full upon him those glorious lights so calm if passionate and perfectly serene had scarcely touched his vision before his own eyes fell he looked asleep and surely must have slumbered for in another instant he had clasped her fingers in a clench which itself told agony beyond all words and pressed them to his lips she felt not summer breath nor blossom kisses but a tear that fell upon her cold hand cold as death then softly warily she folded both her arms  ok fear notdo not be afraid he whispered441 will ask nothing tell you nothing but i will say thisfor my own saxe not yours for of course you cannot suffer i always loved youwould have married youi mean have asked youbut for saronas sake she stretched her white hand with a grace as calm as her unalterable aspect and laid it on his tips one moment he was silent but the next on that strange face of bis there gleamed a spectral smile 4 but you love me again he said this time not whispered  4t i do not ask you to say yes but if you say not 4 no i shall believe it there was no reply and bernard took up the oars he seemed between each soft and soundless dip each silver splash to listen for her voice in fear the soft and sound less dip though silver splash were all the moonlight rocks drew nearer  they were past the cliff shone close and bridit the haven was at hand from the silence between that two companions it might have seemed as though thehaven were the dearest longed for as if uncongenial and unloving they dreaded not but rejoiced to part perhaps it was so for bernard as they approached the mcflringi darted from the boat as if to escape the sea then and for ever i the cholera rages in h sarona fews for roses life

brought a pillow and bernards bead fell into it his feet were in her lap bose sjopd behind sarona but he drew her forwards with his hand put back then bernard opened his eyes upon the twin of his immortal his sister for eternity  i should like to go to sleep were the words of his int earthly voice cecilia felt that they were for her the old proud evening when her foul had mastered his came over her then sank her memory turned dark within her in his strength he had slept at her command  but the charin was spent in her dry eyes and brain and the will her power and her pride passed out of her in prayer no inward voice nor form of thought nor recollected music but a passion which swept eternity and fainted at jehovahs throne while sarona prayed that he might be spared at least till they could bear to lose himwhile rose lifted up her infant longings for his life and healththe one who loved him with a love more strong than death prayed only that he might die and die in sleep and he slept with breath that slept between lips just open till the first of though morning twilight when sarona who had never stirred looked up into cecilias eyes the phantom laid should disturb the soul no more the authors happiest effort is shown in describing the varied phases of nature there is a quaint peculiarityabout the style more observable even than in  charles auchester end which though occasionally pleasing becomes wearisome from its monotony and from a euapicion it engenders that it is not altogether unaffected music metaphysics and the influence of mesmeric power form the chief topics of the novel bnt there is frequently a germanic absence of clearness and precision in the descriptions of the feelings which actuate the unreal phantoms who figure in this

the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,unmarked_contra

great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,unmarked_contra

twentyfive years reminiscences stories and memories by katharine tynan smith elder and co ios 6d net it is required in writers of reminiscences that they possess one of two qualifications either they must have worthy matter to set down or they must have a worthy manner of retailing happenings of small moment in the larger world of affairs with our new psychological scale of values there has come about a new perspective in the relative importance of events thus things that to a former generation seemed of mighty concern now bulk much less largely in our estimation while a detail that one of the older historians would have passed over entirely is now magnified and given its true significance and force so it frequently happens that for sheer enjoyment and for actual edification using that term in its widest sense a book full of memories of the most trivial kind will outshine weightier works both on account of the charm of its style and because of its wealth of significance when both matter and manner are of the highest order the result is likely to become a classic miss katharine tynan for she is not yet mrs hinkson in this volume has brought out of the treasures of memory things both great and small holding the balance pretty evenly between the trivial and the weighty and exhibiting all with much happiness of manner the whole work reminds one of a delightful oldfashioned garden in which one can wander at will and pluck many fragrant and beautiful blooms we turn to the greater names first and find a goodly list sir charles russell gladstone parnell cardinal manning the morrises the rossettis the meynells william sharp w b yeats and george russell ae miss tynan was introduced to gladstone at the house of sir charles russell but the encounter that made the most impression on that occasion was her meeting with parnell towards whom her attitude is throughout worshipful indeed whether one loves or hates that tragic yet fascinating figure one cannot but admire the wholehearted devotion of miss tynan to him and to his cause there is much concerning parnell and much of the writers association with the land league which will interest students of that particular history a very distinct and rather amusing picture of christina rossetti emerges on page 158 she entered the room wearing short serviceable skirts of an irongrey tweed and stout boots her dress did not at all go with her spiritual face and the heavilylidded wideapart eyes which one only finds in a highlygifted woman  i certainly believe she made the worst of herself perhaps as a species of mortification she even affected a short matteroffact way of speaking which took me somewhat aback at our first meeting she put one off sitting at her feet completely concerning william sharp the author says decisively  i may say here that i do not even yet believe that william sharp was fiona macleod but of that more in its proper place on that point we looked anxiously for further enlightenment but found none so we presume we must wait for one of the two further volumes of memories which miss tynan hopes to publish the few glimpses of wilde are not very flattering he seems never to have sparkled in her presence there is a great deal about w b yeats the earlier reminiscences partake very much of the nature of loving banter we imagine that the future biographer of the irish poet may some day be very grateful to miss tynan for her pages on his early development very interesting and curious it is to read of his entire absorption in poetry during youthhe lived breathed ate drank and slept poetry in another place she says i remember how the big dublin policemen used to eye him in those days as though uncertain whether to run him in or not but by and by they used to say shure tisnt mad he is nor yet drink taken tis the poethry thats disturbin his head and leave him alone in his inability to take care of himself and his utter forgetfulness of all but poetry he fulfils the traditional figure of a poet in his youth pretty completely further later reminiscences and a number of letters round off this part of miss tynans book equally interesting is the romantic personality of george russell to whose poetry the english public seems just awakening there is something almost olympian about his figure he tells what is perhaps one of the best stories in the volume he told me a story the other day of a friend of his who somewhere in the wilds of america became friends with an old indian he told him all the marvels of the old worldwireless telegraphy radium men flying in air speech kept long after the speaker is dead wonderful wonderful said the indian tell me more at last the reciter paused wearied the white man is very wonderful said the indian can he do this he stooped lifted a handful of dust and threw it in the air stretched himself upwards and thin delicate flames ascended from his hands and his feet and his hair his body shone in air he was a living jewel from head to foot then the glory faded there was only an old indian can the white man do that he asked it is required also of writers of reminiscences that they should display a certain degree of intimacy and should refrain as far as possible from the use of limelight here again miss tynan satisfies our requirements one does feel closing her book that one has really got to know her the person who emerges with perhaps greatest distinctness from her pages is her own father his strong points and weaknesses are alike set down with a loving pen he is very lovable very human with more than a touch of greatness we are grateful too for the accounts of one or two early friends who died untimely some of them showing considerable promise rose kavanagh frances wynne charles g fagan and jim alderson they are written of with an affection that it is good to see in these reticent days of lesser points we might mention a score if space allowed such as miss tynans theory that hair is an index to character or the naive confession of her early earnings and how she spent them in a way that would shock the unco guid or this single characteristic flash of memory of g b s who in

fiction the mantle of elijah by i zangwill heinemann 6s whatever mr zangwill may be worth as an artist it is clear that he is more than a temperamenthe is a force he exercises a gift noticeable in commanding spirits and parodied in mediocritiesthe gift of range he has the large interest in life detached from himself which has been the inspiration of all great as distinguished from little masters in fiction his ego cheerily travels and is impressed by life it is venturesome and industrious therefore it does not starve for lack of subject matter or feed upon itself there is a kind of genius in being a jew but mr zangwill discovered that the ghettos of the world were not enough for him if not the ghettos neither were the studios and so at last we find him penetrating political laboratories elijah is a prophet who preaches peace and economy in days which the younger generation vaguely imagine to have been extinguished under crinolines in the oliveseason elijah became a cabinet minister and nursed an elisha whose precocious taste in mantles awoke his patrons hopes of an appreciative heir to his own but england emerged both from the crinoline and the glasshouse of 1851 and learned to maffic as well as traffic then elijahs mantle went begging for elisha became an imperialist the tragiirony of the book is both general and personal the man who wished to see  the wen of india amputated  and  the spider spinning his web across the cannons mouth  lived to see his own daughterthe sensitive and idealistic allegrasuffer as the wife of a person who when head of a great department of the state fomented a war which beaconsfield himself might have disdained to excuse and this person was elishaa very respectable though incongruous elisha be it added car en apparence toujours il na rien sacrifie rien repudie ni son norn ni ses theories ni  sa surface de radical as m berard says of another english politician broser is elishas workaday name ana it is one that cleverly indicates the formidable tenacity the expansive selfcomplacence and innate coarseness of fibre which characterise him he is to england what the lyons of unleavened bread is to the united states by cunningly describing himself in his election address as  a humble follower of marshmont the elijah of mr zangwills story he involved the latter in  opinions more iconoclastic than he had ever professed yet it was marshmonts  translation  to the upper house which induced broser to propose to his daughter and his humility did not prevent him from remarking to the first mrs broser when she pleaded her inability to converse with political gentlemen  well talk about me that will always interest them but his second helpmeet knew the texture of his humility and when on the occasion of going to a musichall he observed i couldnt risk hanging about ive wired for a box a  suspicion that what he could not risk was being incognito awoke within her a feeling of absolute pity for his limitations on its political side the book is distinctly successful herein mafekingliness so to call itthough mr zangwill has nought to do with south africais viewed philosophically kingdoms progress en mass in legislation and in almanacs but the quality of the type varies hardly at all through the centuries otherwise we would all be beyondmen underneath  rule britannia  breaks the cry  feefofum a primitive cry for blood or treasure the clever journalist and political opportunist are shadowy artists in insincerity euphemism is so habitual with them that to break to them the painful news that black is not white after all is to incur a serious responsibility these are not mr zangwills words but they outline the train of thought which he suggests on the domestic side his novel leaves something to be desired an immaculate lady of the old school found fault with him in our hearing for the pertness of his early victorian children but it must be observed that mr zangwill does not attempt to reproduce the typical early victorian domestic life he makes however a gallant effort to create the aristocracy in their own homes his duchess drops her final s as the privileged may hear the duke of fife do on the platform at this day when allegra remarks that something is an  economic fallacy she exclaims good graciouswhat is the world comin to such a phrase in your mouthits like a cigar did they drop their rs in those days  it hardly matters what does matter is the importation of a type whose presence in a mundane narrative is as perplexing as that of melmoth the wanderer we refer to the philosophical raphael dominick in whose company the probabilities suffer severely it is a character such as a poetromanticist could invest with charm knowing him to be patently of the stuff of dreams he would have filled him with the mellifluously mysterious speech of dreams and he would have been lifeless but beautiful but the lips of this bodiless zangwill open but to emit a crashing discord of clevernesses in chapter xxl book il he avenges bis creation by making even broser momentarily impossible we also object to the manner in which the characters run against one another for the convenience of the plot this is certainly victorianboth early and late the feminine triumph of the book in our opinion is elijahs wife in youth like how many heroines of fiction  she had clasped a hunted hare to her bosom an action that had made elijah fall in love with her but the cherisher of hares was a nagger of the most impracticable kind  you sent him to the shambles she screams to her innocent husband when she heard that their headstrong son had been killed in the war but when elijah is being mobbed for little englandism she rediscovers the hare in him and cries  fight fair you hounds of hell it is probable that this woman will appear overdrawn to many but we can vouch for the fact that she is an ablystudied cymric type allegra the heroine is drawn more ambitiously she writes a letter to her middleage as mrs meynell did to her old age but she uttered no words comparable with these oh in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee suddenly though time darkness silence hide thee this wind from thy lost country flits beside thee yet allegras letter which recurs as a motif in the book rings pathetically true the idealist she thought to marry turned out to be selfinterest under another name the idealist she did not marry was become a mere egoist and for refuge she had nothing better than a motherly representative of the feudalism she had once despised but we must pause mr zangwills book is as a whole worthy of his reputation lt is wise and witty serious and pathetic if it be not all life it is at least life and mr zangwill and the second of these twain is not bad company even when out of place  the mantle of elijah new novels by i zangwill heinemann that the mantle of elijah is worth reading and that it takes a little more than ordinary reading are selfevident facts matter and style combine to warn off the skipping or casual reader without exactly sympathising with mr zangwills points of view you are interested because he presents them and their interpreters in an arresting fashion there is sincerity in some of the intellectual and moral attitudes of his figures his style has matured a great deal since the days some fifteen years ago when  the premier and the painter was published but even then he showed himself to be as now of a different stamp from the facile and obvious novelists of the hour his new book contains cleverness of a very varied kind traits of fine imagination of high spiritual feeling keen observation of the actual and a singular sense of discrimination in character and dialogue jostle each other he has at command a fund of epigrammatic utterances but unlike the general run of such sayings they are not mere interpolations put in for their own sake they spring from the substance and sentiment of his work and may not be easily dissociated from them the principal interest is political it is also retrospective it is the period when crinolines berlin wool and bad ormolu were in vogue mr zangwill enjoys himself over a description of the decoration of a certain clock where art concealed the article so do we in this tale of a bygone timeand here is part of the clevernessmuch in our present political position is not only suggested but even implicitly judged the antiwar note the  lay down your arms is made to echo with no uncertain sound but there is full as much of private human nature as of politics and the domestic horizon and the motives and working of housohold minds are never swamped in the deluge of public affairs at home or abroad twenty years is a long run for the action of a story especially in these days the mantle of elijah almost demands as much for the development of the intellectual and moral forces of the leading characters they require full play and they get it now and then one feels that they almost get too much of it that the analysis and presentation are almost too close too serried the treatment of the engelborne group in the last part is not altogether happy these people are rather copiously than powerfully drawn yet their influence on allegra the heroine is a reason for their being at the age of sixteen allegra is a convinced but not unattractive idealist this is the most entertaining and interesting part of her career when we meet her again in book il she is a married and disenchanted woman of forty or thereabouts her illassorted marriage with broser a radical politician and her fathers secretary never appears wholly credible he is a strongly marked individual one of the best portraits or pictures in this gallery the mantle of the radical statesman an aristocrat by birth drops at length on the brawny shoulders of broser his follower only too ready to catch it he is the most robust and selfseeking of all the sons of the people yet depicted in fiction one feels the jarring aggressiveness of the man and the coarse germs of good and evil in his temperament he is strangely real the contrast between him and his amiable highsouled leader and the family is an excellent study the list of the peoples grievances and their remedies drawn up by broser and those mr zangwill calls  the boon companions of his political intoxication  is good satire so are his entrance into the house and his subsequent change of front then there is a visionary and much less strongly conceived being an israelite who rhapsodises on a new spiritual species adapting itself to a new spiritual environment and other recondite topics the closing scenes wherein he and a poisoned dagger figure show a slight uncertainty and a weakening

occasionally funny is  gals for girls an idiosyncrasy of this particular duchess or a habit of all duchesses the absence of sufficient data prompts the question the exact epoch of the story is clearly set the great exhibition of 1851 has already taken place before the end the francoprussian war must have been more than in the air though there is no mention of it a war with novabarba is mentioned but is so wrapped up in conditions and circumstances past present or to be that it is not easy nor necessary to disentangle it one does not care to look for discrepancies and anachronisms where there

she can be generous helpful and a charming comrade but the externals of life are real and even solemn to her in a degree that surprises old democratic europe it is more profitable to regard her not in

a single unflattering category after all she points out to us there is a world of difference between say your raw western heiress and the southern woman of good californian family with a century or two of delicate breeding behind her the former does not beseem a coronet the latter may meet an english noble with a pride of race equal to his own such a one is lee tarlton mrs athertons heroine her

she adds brains courage and a high sense of honour we feel that lord maundrell is a lucky man he too is well drawn though with a touch of transatlantic scorn for the impressive  set englishman the

barnstaples fortune and good name to ruin he learns at last that the expenses of maundrell abbey are being paid out of her lovers purse and a strong scene between him and the truehearted lee follows  he was sitting at his desk writing and as he lifted his hand at her abrupt entrance and laid it on an object beside his papers she received no shock of surprise she went forward and lifted his hand from the revolver  must you p she asked  of course i must do you think i could live with myself another day  perhaps no one need ever know  everybody in england will know before a week is over she

stand it as best he can it wont kill him nor his courage hes made of stronger stuff than that and if ive brought the family honour to the dust he has it in him to raise it higher than it has ever been never let him forget that youve played your part well all along but youve a great deal more to do yet youll find that fate didnt steer you into this family to play the pretty role of countess    i am equal to my part  yes i think you are now i have an hours work before me i cant let you go till ive finished you are a strong creaturebut you are a woman all the same you must stay here until i am ready to let you go 11 want to stay with you  thank you sit down he handed her a chair and returned to his writing lord barnstable laid down his pen and sealed his letters he stood up and held out his hand  goodbye he said they shook hands closely and in silence then she went out and he closed the door behind her she stood still waiting for the signal she could not carry the news of his death to his son until he was gone beyond the shadow of a doubt it was so long coming that she wondered if his courage had failed him or if he were praying before the picture of his wife it came at last lord barnstable dies but the atmosphere remains electric we somehow expect that lord maundrell will follow in his fathers footsteps and that lee will fall into the hands of a magerful compatriot who has

supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are

  nadir shah by sir mortimer durand with illustrations constable  co sir mortimer durand has fallen between the proverbial two stools he has written a biographical romance which is at once too romantic to be a real biography and too biographical to be a true romance he confesses that he adopted this form  after some doubt because he found that  the existing accounts of nadir shah whether persian or european are hardly the material from which exact history could now be written no doubt  exact history is rarely to be deduced from eighteenthcentury persian or any other chronicles but a tolerably accurate biography of the great turkman conqueror might have been compiled which would at least have proved a useful contribution to history and would have been valued by students and even by orientalists to whom sir mortimer durands persian scholarship is known to such the present work without a single reference to original authorities is of little interest beyond showing the conception of nadir shahs character and career which an able man formerly resident in teheran and acquainted with the persian sources has formed even this has too much of the obvious in it and offers scarcely any originality we accept unreservedly sir mortimer durands assurance that his story is not  inconsistent with known facts and that he has done his  best throughout to treat known facts with proper respect  but since  this book does not pretend to be a history there appears to be no obligation to treat it with proper respect from the historical or biographical point of view taken merely as a romance founded upon history with the design of giving  more life and colour  to the story of nadirs career the work suffers from overlearning most of the romances in which the manners and modes of thought of the east and its  local colour  are sought to be imparted have been failures there are very few who possess mr marmaduke pickthalls happy gift and though sir mortimer knows persian and has been fairly intimate with upperclass persians we doubt if he knows the people as for example prof brown knew them when he lived amongst them or if he can think in persian as mr pickthall thinks in arabic the result in the present case is that the reader who is probably unfamiliar with persian ways is annoyed by frequently occurring words which he cannot understand and requires a glossary which is not supplied  the romance is burdened with archaeology and the action hampered by an attempt at historical accuracy which nevertheless leaves the reader unconvinced those who are already interested in nadir shah will read this romance of his life with appreciation but not because it is romance those who know nothing about him or his time will be perpetually puzzled and irritated it is not the business of romance to teach history and the mistake here made is not so much the founding of the romance upon an historical basis as the choking of the romance by too elaborate an historical setting the long accounts for example of nadirs campaigns have nothing to do with romance and are merely digressions perfectly justifiable and indeed necessary in a biography but out of place here the subject we admit lends itself to treatment as a novel or as a drama the rise of the turkman robber chief from obscure poverty to w ide empirewonderful though not unparalleled in the east the land of opportunities  the spoiling influence of success and the growth of arrogant ruthlessness under the sun of too favouring fortune the alienation of the affections of the people and finally the army by frequent acts of irresponsible injustice and barbarity culminating in the blinding of his son and the inevitable downward path pointed out by offended nemesis ending in the longforeseen assassinationhere are the makings of a tragedy sir mortimer durand has realised this clearly enough and has drawn the character of nadir with insight  but he is always taking our attention off the main subjectan interesting though not very unusual psychological studyto carry us away to campaigns and marches in places with outlandish names outlandish at least to the majority of readers which could have been sufficiently indicated by a few allusions without interrupting the development of the story the real romantic interest centres not in nadir but in the beautiful tender rajput girl whom he made his bride in india when he was crushing the mogul emperor here sir mortimer is fairly in the realm of romance for whatever truth there may be in nadirs marriage to an indian wife the story of her relations with the conqueror could never have been divulged but the introduction of sitara and her devotion gives the book its chief merit as a romance and also a real charm the indian girl is admirably drawndrawn with knowledge as well as sympathy the inevitable contralto to sitaras soprano the shirazi wife a particularly hateful characterrests on surer historical foundations for sir mortimer had traditions of her related to him by a persian minister who had them from one who had known her second husband residence in persia does not tend to exalted opinions of the people and we do not advise persians of either sex to apply to sir mortimer durand for j a character we cannot recommend the book to novelreaders pur sang they will find it tedious in spite of some charmingand some rather realisticharem scenes the landscape and the historic durbars and the military surroundings are well done yet all the time we feel ourselves not in persia of the eighteenth century but rather in the persia of nasiruddin shah and that is not the feeling the author designed,unmarked_contra
little novels by arthur schnitzler 7s 6d constable not only little novels but too often little themes and little women schnitzler is always skilful often subtle but he is preoccupied with that in human nature which is least admirable and he treats of moods and desires which not only bring humanity into contempt but seem to show that he sees in it little which is not contemptible except when the rarer emotion of pity is aroused this deep distrust of human nature is shown at its height in the last story  the death of a bachelor a maupassant subject handled with a weariness a disillusioned boredom of which maupassant is never guilty the mood of pity is predominant in  the greek dancing girl and the best and latest story in the collection  the murderer here the schnitzler of twenty years ago shows the power and the humanity of his later postwar work and the final scene between alfred and the baron his mistresss champion has real poignancy and dignity we must commend the enterprise of the publishers in introducing more of this rather neglected authors work to an english public,unmarked_contra

narcissus march straight on where they are tragic the tragedy was inevitable the artist selects and tells that selection is his concern and his alone things horrid and inexplicable may happen and it is not his affair to suggest why heaven remains sealed and unanswering any more than it is his business to explain why illusions are often better aids to living than the naked truth he tells and the critics business is with the sincerity and method of presentment not with the choice of subject we rise from the reading of these tales of unrest strengthened not depressed for the work is sincere and it deals with realities mr conrad is a writers writer he is for those who joy in a good sentence a deft characterisation or the way the knots of an exposition are tied but these tales must not be taken with a hop skip and a jump those who want brisk dialogue and breathless action must go elsewhere you must assimilate his background if you would grasp the significance of the figures that dot his middle distance mr conrad is a painter in landscape who could have worked entirely in genre but he chose the other like the great landscape artists he brings equal facility to a sunset or to a man

lagoon  nothing moved on the river but the eight paddles that rose flashing regularly dipped together with a single splash while the steersman swept right and left with a periodic and sudden flourish of his blade describing a glinting semicircle above his head the churnedup water frothed alongside with a confused murmur and the white mans canoe advancing upstream in the shortlived disturbance of its own making seemed to enter the portals of a land from which the very memory of motion had for ever departed    the men poled in the shading water the creek broadened opening out into a wide sweep of a stagnant lagoon the forests receded from the marshy bank leaving a level strip of bright green reedy grass to frame the reflected blueness of the sky a fleecy pink cloud drifted high above trailing the delicate colouring of its image under the floating leaves and the silvery blossoms of the lotus a little house perched on high piles appeared black in the distance   the steersman pointing with his paddle said  arsat is there i see his canoe fast between the piles  three of the stories treat of life in the eastern archipelago where green islets scattered through the calm of noonday lie upon the level of a polished sea like a handful of emeralds on a buckler of steel of these  karabi a memory  is the longest and the most ambitious it is the story of a noble and masterful malay and how he was cured by a young englishman of a terrible illusion on the principle that like things are cured by like the ruse is quite successful  he left us and seemed straightway to step into the glorious splendour of his stage to wrap himself in the illusion of unavoidable success here is a picture of a dutch trader it is karain who is speaking he traded and planted he despised our joys our thoughts and our sorrows his face was red his hair like flame and his eyes pale like a river mist he moved heavily and spoke with a deep voice he laughed aloud like a fool and knew no courtesy in his speech he was a big scornful man who looked into womens faces and put his hand on the shoulders of free men as though he had been a nobleborn chief the story called the idiots brings us nearer hometo france it is a terrible little tale about a peasant proud of himself proud of his wife proud of the bit of land he owned proud of the thought that sons will be born to him who will grow up by his side and carry on his name when he is laid away children are born to himbut one and all are idiots the end is tiie murder of the husband and the suicide of the wife that is how things happened in this unfortunate family and the world went on much the same strangers even became used to the idiot children shouting from the hedgerows  there are unfortunate people on the earth says the mother of the murderess and suicide i had only one child only one and they wont bury her in consecrated ground  it is very sad replies the marquis of chavanes  you have all my sympathy i shall speak to the curd    good day madame here is a final taste of mr conrads quality   that child like the other two never smiled never stretched its hands to her never spoke never had a glance of recognition for her in its big black eyes which could only stare fixedly at any glitter but failed hopelessly to follow the brilliance of a sunray slipping slowly along the floor when the men were at work she spent long days between her three idiot children and the childish grandfather who sat grim angular and immovable with his feet near the warm ashes of the fire the feeble old fellow seemed to suspect that there was something wrong with his grandsons only once moved either by affection or by the sense of proprieties he attempted to nurse the youngest he took the boy up from the floor dicked his tongue at him and essayed a shaky gallop of his bony knees then he looked closely with his misty eyes at the childs face and deposited him down gently on the floor again and he sat his lean shanks crossed nodding at the steam escaping from the cookingpot with a gaze senile and worried well observed is it not  one of the tales in this volume the return treats a modern subject such a subject as has obsessed mr marriot watson more than once to this study of a conjugal fatality mr conrad brings the same vivid observation the same restraint the same artful choice of words and the same sincerity of expression he has written some halfdozen volumes but it is by the nigger of the narcissus and these tales of unrest that he becomes a writer to be reckoned with his full achievement we believe is still in the making  tales of hearsayt in most of conrads stories the theme turns upon a point of honour the crews and even more the officers of sailingships have before their eyes and under their feet a tangible responsibility a responsibility that must be served both by physical and by moral courage not the most conical or feckless can make light of such a charge it has a final and compelling gravity mishandled or neglected a ship is liable to sink with all hands there is nothing funny about it no gleam of humour or alleviating circumstance such as attends the majority of human ills from slipping on a piece of orange peel to going bankrupt no outlet for the native buoyancy of the spirit that in the face of disaster wants to cry no matter and begin over again a shipwreck matters as much as anything  thomas alva edison by francis arthur jones sos 6d hodder  stoughton t  tales of hearsay by joseph conrad 7s 6d fisher unwin can whether ashore or afloat the characters in conrad regard life or life that is worth living as something that through their own fault may at any moment sink under them to their navigating eyes a scruple of conscience a nice point of behaviour is as concrete an obstacle as a rock if they strike it they are doomed they are not baffled to fight better they donot rise on steppingstones of their dead selves to higher things they have no comfortable philosophy in which to bury or justify their mistakes on the contrary they lose their selfrespect their confidence in their ability to behave properly and pine away like the outcast of the islands like the  capataz de cargadores in a kind of spiritual death they are heroic figures patterns of more than roman virtue and we watch with admiration and awe and such sympathy as the weakness of our nature entitles us to give their efforts to live up to their ideals we cannot dismiss their preoccupations as morbid the unrest of a will disabled by brooding they are capable of action though they shrink from it realising its irrelevance its essential onesidedness its antipathy to the perfection for which they strive but they do not therefore excuse themselves from action they know that it will commit them and misrepresent them and they are prepared to take the consequences it was in this spirit that razumov betrayed the refugee who sought his protection in this spirit that the mild humane verloc arranged for his wifes idiot brother to blow up the greenwich observatory and himself and in the present volume the sea captain who sends the fogbound neutral ship to meet destruction on the rocks has the same dilemma to face always humanity and reason are sacrificed to principle we are not told what happened to the sea captain but verloc was murdered and razumov punished by an outrage more horrible than almost anything in fiction it is characteristic of conrads point of view this intense antagonism between reason and action directly an action ceases to be spontaneous and instinctive it is poisoned at its source it becomes a separate malignant power with a life and will of its own and to meddle with it entails a radical change in ones condition like taking an anaesthetic or contracting a disease there is no connecting link no visible fuse even between the passages of contemplation and selfexamination in  victory for example and the welter of meaningless destruction in which it ends we are not to suppose that the  enchanted  heyst one of the most delightful of conrads characters by giving up his life to a parcel of rogues made late amends for the failure of his coal mine action in conrads view seems not a question of one mans life for anothers it is not so reasonable as that still less though it has the appeal of melodrama is it of melodramatic intention and least of all perhaps is it the normal and inevitable expression of passions that have become too strong to be restrained it is like an exhibition of the forces of nature an eruption or an earthquake how can a hundred nuances and qualifications of motive be summed up in a pistol shot or a blow  when in the first and best of the  tales of hearsay the tenderhearted russian lieutenant puts his old friend and benefactor out of his misery in accordance with his wish what is the result  the lieutenant resigns his commission and retires to his estates with a stain on his name this is a tvpically conradian issue to an honourable action an action undertaken in anguish to promote the dignity and decency of life in the last story which turns out unexpectedly so grim is the disguise under which its humour walks to be a joke the mountain of action once more labours and brings forth a legitimate offspring and not a monstrosity voluntarily the mate falls headfirst down the companionwas and by this ruse preserves the secret of his white hair a great risk one would think to achieve a small result but the result is achieved had conrad really been in earnest over this story one suspects that the mate would have been killed it is fruitless to read any author of the first rank without granting his postulates conrad assumes in all his tragic characters a tenacity of purpose a devotion to an idea an inelasticity an obstinacy almostthat are rarely met with one imagines in life a rogue in shakespeare when asked what he will do with himself now that he has been exposed boldly replies  simply the thing i am will make me live it is just that thing that makes conrads characters die or rather the absence of that vital unmoral principle they  cannot live after that the are fallen sometimes one is tempted to feel that many of conrads situa tions would be relieved or e v e n prevented if the characters w o u 1 d avail themselves of those outlets and escapes that life allows and indeed often imposes would captain mchirr have attained or at any rate kept his position if an obstinate disbelief in the barometer had always been a feature of his seamanship might not lord jim have acted upon the fright he got in the harbour as a youth and abandoned a calling for which he was temperamentally unfitted  these are vain frivolous ques tions the whole secret of conrads emotional power depends of course upon the capacity of his characters to take things to heart  tales of hearsay  is full of beautiful passages none perhaps more beautifiul than this  outside the large ingle window the crepuscular light was dying out slowly in a great square gleam vithout colour framed rigidly in the gathering shades of the room  it was a long room the irresistible tide of the night ran into the

peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath  your neighbour is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutysir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane  it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles  a more touching scene is that between sir charles pomander and mrs vanesir charles is in love with mrs vane  now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband pomander  what madam all alone here as in shropshiremabel for the moment sir pomander  force of habit

scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborn to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy  you would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a frienda friend  he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what

character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have i done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman  would he have chosen the day of my arrivalnot if he knew you were coming was the cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed  said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  my last letter written upon th roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly  read me the passage madam on which you argue1 poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she

author will do well to amend in another edition the very clever scene in which mrs woffington imitates mrs bracegirdles acting and leads cibber to believe that the real bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as cibber was concernedwhat mrs woffington who had never seen mrs bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous apology  that this country has yet seen  the thing is impossible for cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last mr vane might have been

mutineers by arthur f j lapge 6s lane  mutineers  belongs to a class of books most difficult for a reviewer to do justice to he cannct te enthusiastic for he cot id have put the story aside at any page without regrc t and yet he must admire much of the workmanship the intelligence the conscientiousness the knowledge of life and hun nature displayed are exceptional there is not a spark of vivacity but to demand viracity is to demand a touch of genius and to crave that in every novel of this fictiongreedy age is absurd mr leg writes of life as many of us know it taday he is familiar with more than one circle of soci ty and recognises the state of fusion to which we are tending when pity for the poor breeds among luxury and socialistic literature is the favourite reading of legart persons 4mutineers is too violent a title most of the rebels hover timidly between two camps and are probably the more comprehensible to the average reader there are careful pictures of life in ifferent grades there are studies of character forcible in themselves though tfle personages do not group well in the story indeed the story is not very satisfactory it is a succession of incidents rather than a whole perhaps the writer shows himself to best advantage in a few beautiful descrptive passages lt no reader skip that really admirable picture of an august landscape will downs by the sea to be fcund on p 142 we wish we had room to quote it  mutineers by arthur e j legge john lane it is unfortunate that the title of this story should so closely resemble that of though preceding work for the books may be confounded by careless librarians and heedless readers mutineers is a very different story indeed from the mutineer it is not a romance but a novel moro properly socalled it does not deal with remote scenes but with english it is of the actual moment it deals with modern social matters taken stir le vlf it is wiso and witty and it sets forth character shrewdly observed and vigorously drawn though story is an ordinary story enough a young lady marries one man while loving anotherand of course after the marriage another begins to dangle and philander also there is a subsidiary story which mainly concerns a lower stratum of society but in the reading though story hardly matters for the book is of the sort in which the mind of the writer his views of life and his exposition of character aro all in all here is a passago in which though husband a silont and an apparently brutal person is shown in his true inward lighthe is riding in a steeplechase   meanwhile presterly was riding through the gloom with a stern expression on his rigid face the result of the race would mean something very like ruin to him  but still ho scarcely thought his mind was only bent on the recovery of gladys necklace he raced down the hill and cleared the fences and came so close together along the bottom he could still hear the beat of crusaders hoofs behind him    queen mab was still moving freely and jumping like a deer but the strain was boginning to tell upon her    he felt that queen mab was labouring under him both animals were beginning to fail but crusader was still creeping up surely the weight must do its work when they reached the hill but he began to feel doubtful queen mabs stride was shortening and hor head sinking lower he was riding for gladys necklace and he meant to winfairly or otherwise the fog was all around them the spectators were far away the other competitors were lost iu the obscurity behind if he won and an objection were lodged there would be no evidence to support it and his word was as good us gregsons as they rounded the bend he suddenly stoored into the middle of tho course carrying crusader with him gregson poured out a stream of fiery language but presterly took no notice with the same rigid look on his face he continued to bore and hustle though opposing horse as they approached though next fence gregson hurled a volley of threats  presterly uttered no sound but as he sat down to ride at the jump he pulled the mare deliberately across crusaders lino    there was a shock a crash of breaking twigs and horses and men rolled headlong on the turf beyond the fence up at though stand the crowd was waiting for some sign of the horses it seemed a long time since they had disappeared into the fog the party on the drag stood up and stared into the veil of obscurity at last the sound of hoofs came faintly to their ears a horseman gradually shaped himself out of the mist and wavered towards them what are the colours t exclaimed gladys eagerly  is it crusader or queen mab  lord st pancras dropped his cigar  it is neither he said one of the despised three was galloping past the winning post  a riderless

  the prueian offlicer by d h lawrence duckworth  co aki net there is a certain sombre brutality in mr lawrences work recalling aspects of zolas la terre or huysmanss  en rade or to come to our own literature mr james joyces dubliners this last indeed furnishes a very fair parallel except that mr joyce adds the touch of farsighted melancholy evident in the later school of irish writing mr lawrence is more sensuous in the thorn in the flesh  and  the vicars daughters  he allows himself full rein in a manner which might have seemed highly disagreeable to an earlier generation yet there is sufficient sincerity in his realism to purge his offence for those who can see his work as a whole and recognise the breadth and accuracy of his characterization the title of the volume is misleading the first two stories alone deal with german subjects the one is a curious demonstration of instinctive brutality on the part of a prussian officer towards his soldierservant whose revenge is equally instinctive in its basis it is an unusual study in psychology not wholly convincing but unquestionably impressive the other also dealing with bullying and brutality is more logical in its motive and consequent crime one of the stories  a fragment of stained glass is a clever piece of imaginative work well conceived and showing knowledge of the periods presented of old time life in an english countryside of the countryside in general german as well as english mr lawrence has a keen and poetic understanding he can see and describe he is kinder in fact to his setting than to the figures that people it and it is possibly just this appreciation of nature in all her beauty and uncompromising movements that impels him to bring out the cruder and more instinctive side of humanity  the prussian officer in these short stories mr lawrence shows himself the salvator rosa of modern psychologists he takes the most ordinary human beings and thrusts them into a veritable tempest of emotion the thunder rolls through their mental atmosphere lightning sears their souls it is magnificent and yet the reader feels an irksome doubt as to whether the circumstances justify all this sound and fury a dull heavy good natured submissive soldier is kicked and bullied by his officer and their feelings are described as if they were both in the grip of the shirt of nessus another soldier subject to giddiness is ordered to climb a ladder and the terror possessing him is described as if he were some orestes pursued by the furies lucretius concourse of atoms  ruining along the illimitable inane  amble gently along compared with the passions that sweep through the mind of a vicars ugly daughter making love to a handsome miner her lungs become  full of fire and a sharp pang like lightning sears her from head to foot  when the miner fails to take an obvious hint the miner himself wvho has lived on not particularly good terms with his affectionate but slightly contemptuous mother feels xwhen that mother lies dying  as if a redhot iron were gripped round his chest there is a want of variety too about the motifs of these hurricanes of feeling the medi eval horse serf revenging himself on his master for a cruel unmerited flogging is only another variant of the tragic theme in the opening story where the persecuted orderly revenges himself on his master the miner ashamed of himself for his bashfulness in the presence of women all the more ashamed because otherwise he feels himself a firstclass labouring man bears a strong family likeness to the firstclass fighting man in the prussian army who is ashamed of himself for his lack of head in going up a ladder the coldblooded calculating curate is halfbrother to the coldblooded blast and cynical officer the one is cruel to his wife the other to his orderly in other stories the feelings are analysed of wives driven by tactless husbands to insisting defiantly on their interest in other men the fact is that mr lawvrence is a master of psychological analysis but like the old germans of the romantic period he loves to operate in a  storm und drang  ens ironment and thereby he necessarily limits his field of operations but let there be no doubt as to his power of analysis it   the prussian officer b d h lawrence os duckwvorth is almost inspired almost uncanny in its truthfulness some arresting sentence some piece of startling insight constantly crosses our path the vicar of a mining village who slipped into  conscious hatred of the majority of his flock and unconscious hatred of himself is one example out of a thousand of his skill in portraiture a correlative of this subtlety of analysis is subtlety of observation as when he remarks of this vicars family that they had  the curiously clean semitransparent look of the genteel isolated poor not a little of the power of the pictures here presented to us lies in the contrast between the minute work of the brush in some parts of the canvas and the broad dashing effects in others when the colour is laid on in splashes so that a farm labourer for example is described in one breath as  uneasy triumphant and baffled to scrutinise too closely such work is to lose its effect studied at a distance as a whole the strong colours melt as in gainsboroughs work into a harmonious unity and produce a lasting impression,unmarked_contra

black magic  pfr amica silentia lunve   is a book for the yeats enthusiast that is to say we should not recommend it to any one who has anything else of mr yeatss still to read a man who knows only  innisfree and  the heavens embroidered clothes  may be left happily with the rest of the poems with the  stories of red hanrahan and should he wish to know something of the poets life with the exquisite  reveries over childhood and youth in  per amica silentia luna mr yeats is less often exquisite than affected it is not his genius that he reveals to us here but some curious crannies of his mind of course mr yeatss mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind and well worth exploring  but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about there are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle here for instance are two consecutive sentences  one night i heard a voice that said   the love of god for every human soul is infinite for every human soul is unique  no other can satisfy the same need in god our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death but only that we should seek it in those who are dead even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom they need mr george robeys interpreting  in other words to simplify them they are the means however by which mr yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts there was no need for mr yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of per amica silentia luna by w b yeats macmillan  co 45 dd net words we are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it mr yeats says   i have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of indian and japanese poets old women in connaught mediums in soho because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world we wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says   faith is the one gift that man can make to god it is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following   all souls have a vehicle or body and when one has said that with more and the platonists one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some church or institution and found oneself with great poetry and superstition which is but popular poetry in a pleasant dangerous world mr yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions he is saying what he means however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose he believes that every great man has a demon to mingle with his life it is a daemon literally and not figuratively speaking who inspires every man of genius the demon who is the creator of the work of art mr yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement and divides them from one another under the names of self and antiself self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses antiself is the daemon maker of a thing far greater than the man himself it is in his attempted explanation of his belief that mr yeats like other theologians breaks down he bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal he experiences what one would describe if one were speaking of oneself as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself mr yeats describes his sensation thus  when i come home after meeting men who are strange to me and sometimes even after talking to women i go over all i have said in gloom and disappointment perhaps i have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle from hostility that is but fear or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy my fellow  diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity and how should i keep my head among images of good and evil crude allegories r how indeed  did not charles lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellowguest had the misfortune to ask if milton was a great poet   but when i shut my door and light my candle i invite a marmorean muse an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different for now there must be no reaction action only and the world must move my heart but to the hearts discovery of itselfall my thoughts have ease and joy i am all virtue and confidence it is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that mr yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work he will not accept the commonplace idea that this  heroic condition  is his true self he regards it rather as  the lord of terrible aspect  who appeared to dante and said  egodominus tuus  the descent of the demon who when the moment of creation comes makes for mr yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius  when i consider the minds of my friends says mr yeats  among artists and emotional writers i discover a like contrast and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work there is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse but with women or liquor in their lives  and mr yeats refers to dantes lechery and shakespeares  pottle pot  with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate but this division into self and antiself is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind it is impossible to divide personality with a butchers cleaver one may get interesting generalisation as the result but one will not get truth if mr yeatss theory were correct psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose the elements of a mans nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air and the air with the veining branches of the tree,unmarked_contra

the wyvern mystery a novel new novels by j s le fanu 3 vols tinsley brothers much will not be said in behalf of  the wyvern mystery by those mild and commonplace people who think that a novel should aim rather at the exhilaration than the depression of the readers spirits that it should forbear to give pain which is not calculated to enhance the effect of its pleasurable representations that its illustrations of the evil should be put in contrast against equally vivid exhibitions of the good of human nature and that at the end it should leave the reader in the intellectual and moral condition of a man who has been listening to fiue music or contemplating a noble work of art or enjoying the stimulus of good company on the contrary by those many persons who delight in strong hysterical emotions and are of opinion that the romancewriter labours within the proper province of his art when he alternately freezes the readers heart and causes his hair to stand on end by pictures of eccentric vice and cruel violence a rush will be made to the libraries for the new tale of the novelist whose present performance surpasses all his previous wild stories in sensational inhumanity that the book overflows with cleverness and force no reader will deny but mr sheridan le fanu adds nothing to his reputation by another display of literary adroitness and melodramatic ability it must also be conceded that much labour has been expended on the first two volumes the separate parts of which are fitted together with the most precise and cunning workmanship and that the character of mildred tarnleythe faithful honest harsh old servingwoman who tells innumerable falsehoods in her masters service whilst she sharply censures his misconduct and sturdily declines to flatter himsecures the book from a charge of being altogether deficient in humour the naturalness of the other feminine characters is not conspicuous but the three principal men of the dramaold squire fairfield of wyvern and his two sonsare creatures of human flesh and blood surcharged with some of the most odious qualities of the race that they dishonour the harsh despotic scurrilous squire of wyvern a brute whose abusive tongue respects neither virtue nor the grave is not untrue to a period when englishmen of common stuff albeit of ancient pedigree used to think it a proof of manly spirit to bully their dependents and drink themselves at least once a day into stupefaction the disdainful abhorrence roused by the selfishness and moral imbecility of the squires elder son who by marrying alice maybell does her the greatest injury it is in his power to inflict upon her is evidence of the skill with which his despicable nature is portrayed and though harry fairfieldwho combines the smart  slanginess  of foker and the meanness of barnes newcome with the niggardliness of miser elwesis a more revolting specimen of the cheat sneak and cad than we have ever before encountered in prose fiction the picture of his loathsomeness does not surpass the bounds of possibility or even wander beyond the lines of experience the opening chapters of the narrative introduce the reader to alice maybell a fair and fortuneless beauty soon after her secret marriage with charles fairfield and to her patron the abusive old squire of wyvern who having in consideration of remote consanguinity extended patronage to her otherwise friendless infancy and girlhood is of opinion that the charming woman should reward his past kindness by consenting to be the wife of his failing years taking this view of her obligations the aged savage woos the frightened girl with a grotesque and boisterous amorousness that reminds us of squire westerns least delicate demeanour in the presence of ladies  and when alice escapes at the same time from his importunities and his house and flies with her bankrupt husband to a desolate and dilapidated old mansion not many miles distant from wyvern the furious dotard curses the pair with the choicest imprecations to be found in his comprehensive vocabulary of abuse and ere long he has grounds for flattering himself that his amiable wishes have not been ineffectual in carwell grange the miserable dwelling to which charles fairfield takes his bride even as a few years earlier he had brought the recentlydiscarded mistress who plays an important part in the drama alices life ia wretched and unseemly that he may not draw his impatient creditors upon him or reveal his lurkingplace to the emissaries of the woman who instead of consenting to her banishment from

blind and unspeakably hideous dutch woman named bertha velderkaust who effects an entrance into the mansion during charlesfairfields absence and whilst alice is in bed of berthas peculiarities it is enough to say that in addition to blindness and the disfigurements of smallpox they comprise a strong appetite for opium and brandy a temper given to maniacal ebullitions of rage and a demoniacal hatred of the woman who has supplanted her in her former paramours affections having contrived to enter the house and terrorised mildred tarnley into giving her a supper and bed this pleasant inmate

sister teresa new novels by george moore fisher unwin mb moore gave no hint if we mistake not in the first edition of  evelyn innes that he intended to write a sequel so that although there is no suggestion of it there is still a possibility that  sister teresa may be followed by a third volume to complete the tragedy of evelyn inness career the need certainly seems to arise for it for the end arrived at in sister teresa is distinctly a case of bathos it will be remembered that evelyn inns was j represented in the first book as a person in o whom sensuality and idealism were constantly struggling for the mastery and there the struggle was left undecided in sister teresa the struggle still goes on only to cease at the end not because any solution has been come to but because evelyn has been ill and she finds that she has not the physical courage to escape from the convent as she had meant to do and that she can do no more than settle down to an inert vegetable existence as a music mistress in a convent school a dead soulless existence is undoubtedly a frequent outcome of such a struggle as there was in evelyns nature but it is no solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great novel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a novel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are traces everywhere of a certain affectation of celticism mr moores recentlyfound celtic aspirations are of course notorious he has not succeeded in keeping them out of his novel there is a passage on p gg   he must go with her to the pure country to the woods and to the places where the invisible ones whom the druids knew etc  wandering in the woods and underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore novelist pure and simple we shall be content  notes on

the sineater and other tales by fiona macleod edinburgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss macleod is the first writer who has tried nativdy to interpret the gael not of the scottish highlands but of the islands te southern readers and for sheer originality other qualities apart her tales in this volume are as remarkable perhaps as anything we have had of the kind since mr kipling appeared they are so original  in fact they treat of so strange a subjectmatter and in so strange a way that the unregenerate saxon may find them at first a little difficult on a further acquaintance he will find that their local colour their idiom their whole method combine to produoe an effect whioh may be unaccustomed but is therefore the more irresistible 44 why asks miss madeod in her dedicatory epistle to mr george meredith why do i write these things  it is because i wish to say to you and to all who may read this book that in what i have said lies the secret of the gad the beauty of the world the pathos of life the gloom the spiritual glamour it is out of these the heritanoe of tiie gad that i have wrought these tales this dearly commits the writer to the romantic method that we find preserved in all these tales though they have here and there a touch of that realism which romance has never been entirely withoutceltic romance especially the first of them the sineater is a capital example in its romantic kind you feel in reading it that the talewriter has not gone to her subjectmatter as a purely disinterested agent on the contrary she brings her passionate predilections instead of being disinterested she is perfervidly interested she goes prepared to find the things that count oeltically speaking and she finds themthe gloom the spiritual glamour and the rest tomorrow some new realist will go over the same ground and bring back his very different report of things as they really are and tell us what queer kind of porridge he saw the achannas eat but miss madeod being to the manner born writes from the inside and not from the outride is affected through her imagination and not through her nerves and is sometimes so carried away by her subject that she forgets how suburban the modern reader is apt to be and how he likes his sealions caged and labelled and his peatsmoke described in terms of fleetstreet not only does she forget this she deliberately does all she can to inorease the sea terror the wildness and the gaelic savour of her tales the sineater begins with the wet wind and the sea mist of the western ides and ends with the wild cry of the man neil ross as he goes down in the  black eddy  that rushes between skerrymohr and skerrybeag an eirig rn anama  in ransom for my soul all through it one hears the seanoises and feels the seawind and the sineater is treated in bold accord with such elemental circumstance half man half myth he is the scapegoat of the sea he bears the sins of others but with no scapegoats innocence therein lies the motive which is treated in this tale with so much force at last he makes his seaexit on a spar that is like the cross nay in the words of aulay maoneill who tells his end  it was the cross he was on i saw that thing with the fear upon me ah poor drifting wreck that he was judas on the cross it was his eric still more strange and from an english point of view more simply and artistically constructed and written is  the dannanron perhaps the finest thing in the book   you know what is said in the ides about    about this or that man who is under jheasan  who is spellbound    and    about the seals and    says marcus aohanna to anne the heroine of this strange tale   they say that seals he repeated slowly they say that seals are men under magic spells here we have suggested a fine dramatic motive at the threshold of an old gaelic folktale and miss madeod uses her opportunity with singular control of the magic machinery of an uncanny subject the figure of gloom aohanna who plays the tune of the dannanron on his feadan an oatenpipe or flute is one not easily forgotten he lives with unreal reality in ones mind his wild tunes hold ones ear though they are described with characteristic celtic exaggeration by indirection by colour instead of musio as eg  again gloom took up the feadan and sent a few cold white notes floating through the hot room breaking suddenly into the wild fantastic opening air of the dannanron a few pages further and we come upon manuss song which with the description that follows may be given as an instance of miss macleods writing of both verse and prose  the tide was dark an heavy with the burden that it bore i heard it tal kin whisperinupon the weedy shore each wave that stirred the seaweed was like a closing door tis dosing doors they hear at last who hear no more no more my grief no more 44 the white seawaves were wan and grey its ashy lips before the yeast within its ravening mouth was red with streamy gore 0 red seaweed o red seawaves 0 hollow baffled roar since one thou hast 0 dark dim sea why cauest thou for more my grief for more p  in the quiet moonlight the chant with its long slow cadences sung as no other man in the isles could sing it sounded sweet and remote beyond words to tell the glittering shine was upon the water of the haven and moved in waving lines of fire along the stone ledges sometimes a fish rose and split a ripple of pde gold or a seanettle swam to the surface and turned its blue or greenish globe of living jelly to the moon dazzle there is some excess of mere colour it maj be thought in all this but that too is very celtic and so throughout these tales the manner of their telling their idiom their very mannerisms only tend to increase their total effect to quote again from their tellers singular opening epistle from iona addressed to him whom she calls  prince of celtdom  they have been written  as by one who repeats with curious insistence a haunting familiar yet ever wild and remote air whose obscure meanings he would fain reiterate interpret it is only by insisting as she does with some romantic excess on the vivid traits and idioms of the remote gaelic folk she describes that she brings home to us their speech sentiment and spirit of life as the true interpreter may she expressly disavows the documentary method at the start she is subjective and interpretative to a degree she is often so much moved by her own subject matter that heines famous confession of overmuch sentiment iu his buch le grand is apt to recur as one reads her tales then are not documentary they reveal their writers individuality quite as much as the idiosyncrasy of the island gael but just for this very reason they provide as original an entertainment as we are likely to find in this lingering century and they suggest a new romance as among the potential things in the century to come  ernest rhys,unmarked_contra

cannot quite share the enthusiasm of some of our contemporaries so as to term this novel  preeminent and peerless it is a very clever novel but it is not what the lexaminer calls it mrs norton possesses a great deal of descriptive power and much pathos her writings are always pleasant to read  she appeals strongly to our sympathies and her composition is remarkable for a certain glow of eloquence felt though it cannot be described but she is not peerless on the contrary she has many superiors she is defective in the two most important features of the great novelistshe cannot create characters nor can she construct an ingenious plot unlike most writers of fiction mrs norton has given us in stuart of dunleath a very uninteresting hero and in eleanoit a very interesting heroine the former is intended to portray a mind infirm of purpose but instead of that we have an inconsistent personage the distinction wtill be obvliots to the reader no person could well be so unlike himself as david stuart is represented to be at different periods of his history eleanor on the contrary is sustained with admirable skillthe same being from the beginning to the end and perfectly in keeping always with her original type we pursue her through all her varied fortunes her first affections their blight her subsequent marriage and misery her maternal joys and sorrows so intense and fatal with a syimpathy that never for a moment fails and which sustains the attention breathlessly through the work until it is concluded and we lay it down with more inclination to weep for the early dead than to rejoice in the happiness of the living we will not give an inkling of the story of this novel for we remember how often our own pleasure in the perusal has been marred by the imperfect revelations of a review presenting just enough to destroy surprise and curiosityimportant ingredients in the pleasure of novel reading without those details which serve to make the story amusing nor is there any greater injustice to the author than such a manner of noticing a novel for it is impossible not to defoim the plot lvy such a condensation of it presenting it to the reader in a shape calculated to lower his estimate of the authors capabilities and make him deemn iieanly of a book whose worth may consist after all as does this one not so much in the stury itself as in the manner of telling it

  new novels why did he do it  by bernard capes methuen  co when mr capes condescends to melodramatic mystery he is apt to take it too lightly he is well equipped for it but to succeed perfectly a writer of melodrama must believe in it or at least not show that he does not believe in it in  the great skene mystery mr capes spoilt his effects by laughing at himself if he must laugh in these affairs let him laugh in his sleeve probably that is what he did when he wrote  why did he do it  it is a fantastic piece of work written with all the skill and style of the author and starting from a very original motive which teases and tantalizes there is perhaps a little disappointment in the fact that the hero is largely divorced from the unravelling of the mystery which falls into the hands of a friend a second defect is that one guesses the nature of the secret half way through and perhaps a third may be added for some tastes at any rate because the mystery has reference to the occult mr capes can draw character with any novelist living but it is not part of his business to delineate human beings here he is content with the conventional and the grotesque it is a pleasure to read a sensational story written by a literary hand even if he does not take his task altogether seriously,unmarked_contra
a tramps sketches the soul of a tramp by stephen graham macmil lan and co 5s net this book is a record of a walk along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and of a pilgrimage to jerusalem it differs markedly from most books of travel however in that the author is less concerned with the things seen along the line of route than with his own spiritual emotions and experiences as he himself says it is not so much a book about russia as about the tramp mr graham is among those who find salvation by going out into the wilderness he reminds one at times of thoreau there is the same impatience with the meaningless restraints of civilisation the same wild exuberant delight in the freedom of nature but whereas thoreaus withdrawal from the world had bred in him a certain scorn of humanity mr graham is overflowing with the milk of human kindness he finds friends everywhereamong the peasants of the russian steppes in eastern monasteries or turkish bazaars thoreau was alike by conviction and temperament a pagan the tone and temper of mr grahams book on the other hand are those of the christian so one is not surprised at the note of blitheness that runs through these pages often footsore the wanderer is never weary the world is full of unexpected delights there is the joy of the road the feeling of exhilaration that comes upon a man as he shoulders his knapsack and sets forth bravely into the unknown and there are quiet restingplaces at the journeys end sunrise and sunset the sound of the sea the music of birds darkness and the coming of dawnthese things become invested with a new meaning to the man who has gone out into the wilderness to find his soul he has time too to thinkand to pray and prayer mr graham would have us believe has an added effectiveness when offered amidst the silences of nature    prayers he writes are strong out of doors made in the presence of all the stars one is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there is calm all around and in ones own heart the mysterous beauty of the starry sky reflects itself in the soul and across its mirror sails the pale moon my own body becomes a cradle in which the little christ child

free for a few hours at least of the company of saints and heroes this much we owe to mr graham who has added to english literature a book that if we mistake not is destined to endure  a tramps sketches by stephen graham 5s net m5acmillan the reader may consider mr grahams book in two lights either as a volume of remarkably interesting reminiscences of life on the open road or as a powerful appeal to the modern world to forsake the worship of the golden calf the authors tramp was along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and eventually to the heavenly city in the company of russian pilgrims his pen paints delicate little portraits of the simple and loveable russian peasant it describes too with striking vividness nights spent in strange cities and in lonely shacks i slept with the bare world as my house the sky as my roof and god as host he writes and lest an incautious reader should exclaim  how lovely we hasten to add that like the apostle paul mr graham was often in perils of waters in perils in the city and constantly in weariness and painfulness but the author expressly states that his book is more concerned with the tramp than with russia  it is the life of the wanderer and seeker the walking hermit the rebel against modern conditions and commercialism who has gone out into the wilderness commercialism he says is at present the great enemy of the individual man and the only hope for salvation is first of all for a few to live their lives out to the full in order that all others may live their lives completely mr graham seems conscious as he writes that he is a prophet crying in the wilderness and even if some of his readers may consider that he is imagining a vain thing they will be constrained to admit that the pursuit of this ideal has one great merit so far as mr graham is concernedthe delightful record of his vagabondage  a tramps sketches by stephen graham macmillan and co this is another volume by the author of undiscovered russia a charming tour of a tramp a real tramps life along the caucasian and crimean shores mr stephen graham admits frankly that he is a wanderer by predilection a rebel against modern conditions of

yet full of incident of aperfus into russian conditions and the minds of peasants revealing a real spiritual and material sympathy both with the black earth and the monks of monasteries whose hospitality he enjoyed and with his fellowcomrades of the road it is life that interests the author here we can get it and it is like splashing about in a clear pool on a warm summers day spontaneous

the gadfly by e l voynilh 63 heinemann one cannot read this book through without great admiration for its talent and its uncommon vigour it may be doing if a good turn with some readers to say that the preliminary chapters give no adequate idea of the writers powers a story of the times and struggles of young italy the incidents are stirring and picturesque enough but the real interest centres in the  gadfly a notorious conspirator and scathing pamphleteer and still more in his embodiment of the claims of humanity as against the claims made by the church for a crucified god it is a hysterical book but we own it is so chiefly because the gadfly  is hysterical by the writers intention he is one of those who gain a tremendous influence over their fellows for this strong reason among others that their point of view is personal that the circumstances and the friends of their own private life rule their attitude of love or defiance to the general world such men and womenthe women are many of course are vivider than others and impress their contemporaries though they are often unjust and unreasonable the writer seems to be haunted by a sense of the punishment for sin and weakness allotted to mortals the  gadfly for the overtrust the oversensitiveness of his youth is tortured ever after wounded maimed letrayed forced to fight against the being he loves best on earthhis father the great churchman his father for an early sin expiated by a long life of repentance selfdenial and benevolence has virtually to condemn his own son to death in the end just at the moment when he has come back from the dead to him there is too much torture mental and physical in the book and all the scenes do not convince us we believe the cardinal died of a broken heart but he who upheld the dignity of the church so long who chose its interests and the true safety of his flock before the life of his beloved son did not break out into that hysterical raving on corpus christi day what is altogether real and admirable is the personality of the bitter biting mocking suffering 1 gadfly untameable unrelenting and always  game a living man that will force the most unwilling readers sympathy as he wvon that of the men and women he worked with so discomfortably and with such splendid loyalty  thc gadfiy by e l voynich heine mann the strength of this book lies in the terrible tragedy underlying its plot arthur at the commencement of the story is found devotedly attached to his father confessor montanelli the lad is a student at the university of pisa and the reputed son of an angloitalian merchant at leghorn his friend is the director of a theological seminary and has earned a high reputation in the mission field of c iii na enthusiastic and nervous arthur has been inspired with the fervour of italian aspirations which preceded the mazzinian efforts of 1846 deeply religious he has endeavoured to combine this enthusiasm of democracy with his traditional faith and the confessor temporises with the conflict of emotions in his pupil poor arthur henceforth the gadfly is first physically crushed by severe imprisonment for partaking in the revolutionary movement and then spiritually scared by the discovery that the saintly montanelli is in fact his natural father he breaks at once with his supposed relatives the curiously philistine english merchants who tolerated him and suppressed their knowledge of his origin until his revolutionary escapade and betakes himself to south america whence after terrible privations he emerges thirteen years later to take a militant part against all foreigners and clericals arthur in his ingenuous stage is a little deficient in manliness on his return as a casehardened adventurer he falls into the bloodthirsty methods of an originally weak nature embittered yet the conflict of feeling in him his love for his father in spite of his vindictive opposition to him his easy reassertion of his influence over gemma the love of his youth who has married his rival and been widowed during his exile the contrast between his political ferocity and his tenderness to children and other weaklings make him a rarely interesting figure even more so is the successful prelate and lifelong penitent montanelli the relations and conversations between the two when the cardinal finds his son again in the wounded and defeated conspirator to whose death he is in a manner forced to consent on grounds of public safety though this incident is hardly supported by sufficient necessity are treated with a masterly if almost too ghastly wealth of detail and the deaths of the unhappy pair are infinitely dramatic though the interest is concentrated in the hapless father and son many of the minor characters like the patient conspirator gemma and her selfeffacing lover martini are sketched with pains  reviews the gadfly by e l voynich w heinemann i this is a remarkable story by an american writer which readers who prefer flesh and blood and human emotions to sawdust and adventure should consider as something of a godsend in order to give an idea of the book the outline of the plot must be told arthur burton an orphan a sensitive affectionate emotional enthusiastic youth of eighteenrevolutionary and pietist in one is arrested on a true charge of conspiring against the italian government and is thrown into prison he admits nothing denies all knowledge of his companions and completely baffles the authorities on gaining his release he discovers that the information for his arrest was communicated by the priest to whom he had confessed his jealousy of a fellow conspirator almost immediately afterwards gemma arthurs ideal of womanhood believing him to be a traitor to the cause to which she also belongs strikes him across the face and repulses him for ever and his guardians wife in a fit of rage at the discredit she considers him to have brought upon the family lets out the secret that he is the son of an illicit union between his mother and canon montanelli a good man and arthurs dearest friend these three blows coming one upon the other with such suddenness are too much arthurs faith in god and man crumbles away he seizes a hammer and smashes his crucifix spurns montanelli arranges a convincing story of his suiride by drowning and escapes for south america as a stowaway that is the prologue thirteen years pass and arthur returns as felice rivarez another monte cristo bent upon revengea cripple and a cynic gifted with great power of satire an avowed disbeliever in human fidelity aud truth and the implacable foe of priestcraft and religion under the soubriquet of the gadfly he is employed by the liberal party to carry on a pamphlet war against the jesuits gemma is a member of the committee from whom he receives his instructions montanelli who is now a cardinal is the opponent whose influence it is most important to break down the core of the story is the gadflys struggle between his true nature and his imposed nature between his love for his father montanelli and for gemma and his hostility to christianity it is unnecessary to follow his career as a conspirator let it suffice that in the end he is captured and sentenced to death cardinal montanelli alone stands between him and the grave a terrible scene takes place in the condemned mans cell resulting in the gadfly confession that he is the arthur of old the cardinals son 44 montanelli sat like some stone image or like a dead man set upright at first under the fiery torrent of the gadflys despair he had quivered a little with the automatic shrinking of the flesh as under the lash of a whip but now he was quito still after a long silence he looked up and spoke lifelessly patiently 4 arthur will you explain to me more clearly p you confuse and terrify me so i cant understand what is it you demand of me  the gadfly turned to him a spectral face 41 demand nothing who shall compd love p you are free to choose between us two the one who is most dear to you if you love him best choose him 41 cant understand montanelli repeated wearily 4 what is there i can choose p 1 cannot undo the past 4 you have to choose

frontier acknowledge me publicly but if you dont love me enough for thatif this wooden idol a crucifix is more to you than ithen go to the colonel and tell him you consent and if you go then go at once and spare me the misery of seeing you i have enough without that montanelli looked up trembling faintly he was beginning to understand 41 will communicate with your friends of oourse butto go with youit is impossible i am a priest 4 and i accept no favours from priests i will have no more compromises padre i have had enough of them and of their consequences you must give up your priesthood

of a god p i will not take his leavings if you are his you are not mine 4 would you have me tear my heart in two  arthur arthur do you want to drive me mad p the gadfly struck his hand against the wall 4 you have to choose between us he repeated once more montanelli permits the law to take its course and the gadfly is shot this is the scene on the ground of execution  he had repeated the request that his eyes might not be bandaged and his defiant face had wrung from the colond a reluctant consent they had both forgotten what they were inflicting on the soldiers he stood and faced them smiling and the carbines shook in their hands 41 am quite ready he said the lieutenant stepped forward trembling a little with excitement he had never given the word of command for an execution before 4 readypresentfire  the gadfly staggered a little and recovered his balance one unsteady shot had grazed his oheek and a little blood fell on to the white cravat another ball had struck him above the knee when the smoke cleared away the soldiers looked and saw him smiling still and wiping the blood from his cheek with the mutilated hand 4 a bad shot men he said and his voice cut in clear and articulate upon the dazed stupor of the wretched soldiers  have another try a general groan and shudder passed through the row of carabineers eaoh man had aimed aside with a secret hope that the deathshot would come from his ndghbours hand not his and then the gadfly stood and smiled at them they had only turned the execution into a butchery and the whole ghastly business was to do again they were seized with sudden terror and lowering their carbines listened hopelessly to the furious curses and reproaches of the officers staring in dull horror at the man whom they had killed and who somehow was not dead the governor shook his fist in their faces savagely shouting to them to stand in position to present arms to make haste and get the thing over he had become as thoroughly demoralised as they were and dared not look at the terrible figure that stood and stood and would not fall when the gadfly spoke to him he stahed and shuddered at the sound of the mocking voice 4 you have brought out the awkward squad this morning colonel let me see if i can manage them better now men hold your tool higher there you to the left bless your heart man its a carbine youve got in your hand not a fryingpan are you all straight p now then  readypresent  4 fire  the colonel interrupted starting forward it was intolerable that this man should give the command for his own death there was another confused disorganised volley and the line broke up into a knot of shivering figures staring befor them with wild eyes one of the soldiers had not even dischargedhis carbine hehad flung it away and crouched down moaning under his breath 41 cant1 cant the smoke cleared dowly away floating up into the glimmer of the early sunlight and they saw that the gadfly had fallen and saw too that he was still not dead for the first moment soldiers and offioials stood as if they had been turned to stone and watched the ghastly thing that writhed and struggled on the ground then both doctor and colond rushed forward with a cry for he had dragged himself up on one knee and was still facing the soldiers and still laughing 4 another miss tryagain ladsseeif you cant he suddenly swayed and fell over rideways on the grass 4 is he dead p the oolonel asked under his breath and the doctor kneeling down with a hand on the bloody shirt answered softly 41 think so god be praised 4 god be praised  the colond repeated 4 at last  these quotations bear rather upon the dramatic value of the book than upon its psychology its psychology is as it happens not impressive mr voynich can conceive interesting characters but at present he lacks the power to embody them adequately his imaginative force is in advance of his execution the end of the book where action predominates is better than the earlier chapters where conversation has to bear the brunt of the work mr voynich has no gift of flashing insight he tells us much of the gadflys wit but we meet with little worthy the name the book needs to be more tensemore well more meredithian vittoria was ever before me as i read the fabric of the gadfly is so good that some day mr voynich might rewrite the story but as it stands it is more

the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity  the works of george meredith memorial edition vols ivl constable  co this memorial edition of merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use for the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciation  the works of george meredith 17 vols 6s each constable to fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  standard edition  of

new novels the heavenly twins by sarah grand 3 vols heinemann  the heavenly twins  is one of those books which it is difficult to criticise satisfactorily for in spite of its chaotic and haphazard arrangement and its unsatisfactory ending it is so full of interest and the characters are so eccentrically humorous yet true that one feels inclined to pardon all its faults and give oneself up to unreserved enjoyment of it the author is a lady who in the flippant words of the oxford magazine has come to believe in the mission of woman to civilise man to teach him to know his position and to estimate hers if he can but her ideas on the subject are dreadfully vague and though she gives some interesting cases of women who attempt the problem of readjusting the relations of the sexes their efforts are not crowned with much success there is indeed a shadowy personage called ideala who has organised a mysterious society for this purpose and for though propagation of a new religion and who it is hinted has obtained a solution of the difficulties but her utterances are too rare and dark to be intelligible the heavenly twins has been compared in a contemporary journal to 4 the story of an african farm the comparison is just inasmuch as both authors express a bitter sense of revolt against existing social arrangements both have a theory that to woman is reserved the future salvation of the world without any definite conception of how she is to accomplish it and in both books the intensity of feeling and the wealth of imagination are so great that the story is overburdened with a plethora of material which might with advantage have been distributed over several novels in this book there are at least two stories that of the heavenly twins which gives the book its title and that of evadne the wife who was no wife the twins angelica and diavolo young barbarians utterly devoid of ali respect conventionality or decency are among the most delightful and amusing children in fiction the conception of twosuch little monsters and the frank description of the superfluity of their naughtiness without encroachment on the domains of the improbable would alone have been remarkable  but to have made them at the same time lovable and to have related their unconventional escapades with the delicacy and good taste of  sarah grand shows something more than mere cleverness in the story of evadne which is really quite unconnected with the other except from the accident that evadne happened to know the twins the author has surmounted a great difficulty with success evadnes story is briefly this she is a thoughtful and clever girl of strong will who marries a man thinking him to be all that is good and noble on her wedding day she discovers that his character has been that of a  man of pleasure and she only consents to stay with him on the condition that they shall not live in the relations of husband and wife in spite of all protests from her parents and her friends and though it is represented to her that she might be the means of elevating him and she never swerves from her determination the difficulty lies not in making the reader intellectually approve of her position  the natural tendency would be theoretically to justify such a character but to regard her as almost repulsively cold and heartless especially as tne husband loyally abides by the arrangement and is represented as rather gentlemanly and pleasant than otherwise but in so vividly describing the state of her mind and the womanliness of her nature that the only feeling of the reader is sympathy and pity for her and this sarah grand has done she has created a true and delicate woman not a strongminded female made up of cold abstractions whom one instinctively thinks of ns wearing pincenez and short hair considerations of space permit us to notice one more point only in this bookthe quiet humour with which the author describes the characters she has the inestimable merit of hardly ever obtruding her personal views of them on the reader who is allowed to discover their peculiarities for himself gradually as if he were living with them this is especially the case with some of the minor characters mr hamilton wells for example the submissive father who makes tea and talks crude platitudes appears at first as if he were merely an insignificant bore  and that is how he would strike a stranger but closer acquaintance with him reveals the fact that he is a humourist of a high order and that the seeming platitudes are generally very much to the point in case another edition is printed it may be mentioned that either the author or the printer is shaky in french witness ilya deslonguers par envy dattaquer and the maxim given as  chercher la femme,unmarked_contra

stories from the bible the first impression is what good value for money is this stout and well printed volume and by such an author  the next feeling is one of uneasy apprehension how  stories from the bible  the book is obviously not an anthology of extracts has mr de la mare been bold enough to rewrite the prose which is inwoven with the memories of childish years for so many of us  one opens the volume at random at the story of the plagues of egypt and starts reading a paragraph so it continued for seven days and when the seven days were at an end moses came again into the presence of pharaoh is ones fear allayed by that  or this for now the river not only continued to flow bloodred but the fish in it perished or this  the river stank and not the river alone   partly the prejudiced inclination for the already familiar has made us ready to be irritated on any provocation but still there is something not quite right about such things as these it seems somehow neither the bible nor the walter de la mare whose prose we admire so wonderingly we turn to the pleasant  introduction and find quickly that no man can be more convinced of the dangers that beset his task than the author himself for he says  ords in their influence are subtle and delicate beyond all things known to man and the least change in them when the are in company or the least addition to that company cannot but entail a change of meaning a change that is in their complete effect on the mind and spirit of the reader then to illustrate this truth mr de la mlare quotes parallel passages in the book of ruth from different versions the  wycliffe  i382 the  wycliffe  revised by john purvey 1386 the miles coverdale version 1536 the geneva bible 1560 the douai bible 16o9 the authorised version 161 i it is a most instructive lesson and just the kind which would leave a treasure in the mind for ever and there comes the reflection how happy a mortal is that child who discovers the  story  of c come hither  for himself and then reads what mr nahums grownup disciple has done in these renderings of old testament stories made  to put that remembrance of what the bible meant to him as a child  as completely as i can into words for doubts and fears depart with a straightforward reading it is no compliment to mr de la mare to pretend against ones better judgement that there are no flaws at all in the prose anywhere no flaws that is of a kind avoidable by such a writer as mr de la mare there are a few uneasy and inept touches when perhaps the wish to enliven the manner was not accompanied by his generally exquisite sense of rhythm and style but as a whole these renderings show that literary style and the simple beauty which should be but is too rarely made the test of suitability for childrens reading are not incompatible but necessary one to the other that alone is a triumph it is to be expected that in recording his imaginative experience of the old stories mr de la mare should sometimes abandon the bald directness of the bible narrative e  stories from the bible by walter de la mare 7s 6d faber  faber and though the change involves often a real sacrifice it is not difficult to be reconciled to the new beauty of detail introduced such detail and such atmosphere must surely give to a young reader visions which the old narrative alone could not even the sophisticated reader will find himself constantly thanking the author for enriched understanding fresh perceptions this is especially true where the setting allows scope for the characteristic prose of mr de la mare to say that the reader of  the riddle and other stories  will not be disappointed with this book is perhaps the aptest praise possible but this is to speak of the mere writing which if it is less free from the  defects and shortcomings  referred to by the author in his introduction is nevertheless the fruit of a task far more difficult accomplished as perhaps no other living english writer could have accomplished it consider the field covered by this volume divided into nine main sections headed  the garden of eden   the flood joseph   moses  the wilderness  samson samuel   saul david think of the dreadful pitfalls awaiting anybody who would rewrite the bible stories under these headings  is it not then a triumph to have enriched future generations of readers with so little offence to the most unprepared and irritable  there are uninteresting irrelevances and ugly barbarities in the old testament a child may come to such a book as this losing hardly anything of worth except an occasional marvel of directness but gaining contact with the ancient word and also with the rare mind of a poet writing in his own language r l megroz,unmarked_contra

sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think him soour grandchildren will do neither our utmost stretch of indulgence is to excuse the sailor because he was only a sailor sailing away as a boy and all his life from the charmed circle of insular prejudice learning life by living and foreign peoples in their own homes instead of in british parlours lecturerooms and missionary meetings admiral hobart like many another sailor of vigorous understanding unsophisticated conscience and limited culture failed to appreciate the timehonoured prejudice which should have forbidden him to respect in the infidel those very virtues dignity sobriety fortitude domesticity truth generosity and love of justicewhich he had been taught to revere as the peculiar appanage of his own countrymen in his eyes the swindling greek was no better than

a collection of short stories the garnet bracelet by alexander kuprin duckworth 7s net in his introduction to this volume of short stories mr lion phelps professor of english literature at yale university has seized the opportunity to inform caution and put right american opinion upon the whole subject of russian literature his manner in so doing is unfamiliar to english readers it makes us feel that while we read we are like alice dwindling away in height by the end of the first page we are much too young even to attend a university  by the end of the second and especially when that tiny little joke is popped into our baby mouths we are of a size to spell out maxims at a learned knee  a novel is not great simply because it is written in the russian language nor because its author has a name difficult to pronounce or a slavishno pun intendedadoration of russian novels is not tself an indication of critical intelligence or a pessimist is not necessarily a profound thinker nor is unclean ness in itself a sign of virility but surely mr phelps exaggerates the extreme innocence of american literary opinion  he must surely be mistaken in not realising that it has long cut down these modest flowers of thought with its little hatchet nevertheless even kuprin is described in terms that remind us of those infantile dogmatics about the cat and the mat and  run fox run    he soars and he sinks  he is holy and he is coarse  he is sublime and he is flat between this introduction and the preface contributed by the translator mr pasvolsky who ls at naive pains to inform us when kuprin is at his best and why he is at his best the author makes a difficult bow but happily the first story which gives the title to the book is wonderfully successful and so the bow is a triumphant one  the garnet bracelet  is a story of hopeless love it tells how a poor official fell in love with the beautiful princess vera nicolaeyna for seven years he wrote to her and then on her birthday he sent her the bracelet at this her husband and brother interfered they sought the man out and he after giving them to understand that he fully realised the impossibility of the situation promised them to disappear next day the princess read of his suicide she received from him a letter written just before he had shot himself expressing his happiness in having loved her and begging her to ask someone to play for her in his memory the largo appassionata from sonata 2 op 2 of beethoven from this oldfashioned plot oldfashioned like the poor bracelet with its illpolished stones its green stdrie in the middle with the five deep red ones surrounding there come rays of deep quivering light and all that they reveal is linked together just for one moment becomes part of the tragic lifestory of the strangely simple man for whom  to love was enough  may nothing transient or vain trouble your beautiful soul he writes but the life of the princess is composed of what is transient and vain  the society in which she lives is transient and vain  real love could have no part in it but being woman her secret dream is of a love that shall fill her whole life  it has come near her and now it is gone for ever the other stories in the book do not approach the first  horse thieves  and  the jewess  are we imagine written under the influence of tchehov the first which is an account of a little boys association with beggars and thieves and contains a hideous picture of mob violence has many a touch which puts us in mind of the great writer but only to marvel before kuprins heaviness at the delicacy and surety of the other in  the jewess again it is easy to see in what soil the idea has been nourished but a sorry weed has grown coarse straggling with no flower at all for all the authors urging until at the last he has propped it up with an old stick of allegory which never for an instant deceives us a word must be said about  an evening guest in a letter giving a hst of the works he considers his most successful the author places it first this is very interesting as showing the extraordinary difference between the russian consciousness and ours to us  the evening guest  is quite impossible  it is very nearly absurd in its ingenuousness one evening somebody knocks at th writers door it sets him wondering who is there who might be there and how unknown is the future he compares life at great length to a game of cards and then imagines that some madman should hit upon the idea of a lottery of life on an appointed day there would stand an enormous urn filled with cards one of which we must draw and then what is life except this drawing of lots out of an urn of fate  and so on until he falls to wondering whether he will be able to make certain sounds to which that other person on the other side of the door will respond until finally when we are almost inclined to call it childish he cries  every time that i think of the vastness complexity darkness and elemental accidentality of this general intertwining of lives my own life appears to me like a tiny speck of dust tossed in the fury of a tempest what more is to be said  k m,unmarked_contra
i tor the soul of a jwitch by j w brodie innes rebman 6s this is a new genre of historical novel the leading characters are of course fictitious writes the author naively enough but there is no reason why they should not have existed there are blanks and laminae in family and local history about that period and if beatrix and alaidair actually lived their lives as i have dreamed there are certain subsequent events that would be more clearly accounted for than they are there is much virtue in an  if and this is not the way we now regard tantalising lamin e in family and local history the author however has contrived a wild and mysterious story where almost everyone seems to have the gift of second sight and the power of seeing somewhat more than the mere material envelope of things there are mysterious happenings merewolves and witchcraft of the wildest nature on almost every page the interest centres in gecily ross who is a study of a dual personality as cecily ross she is a pure delicate somewhat hysterical young woman who dreams dreams and sees visions in her secondary personality which comes upon her at the full of the moon she is elspet simpson the gypsy witch of the border who glories in every form of evil delights in lust and bloodshedand torture and in fact entirely reverses her nature alaidair cumming the hero and his uncle make a fight for the soul of this girl but she dies on realising that her nightmare dreams are realities the author has wisely eschewed the familiar archaic jargon of the historical novel which is so unconvincing but now and then the modernity of thought and language is too glaringly apparent as when eochain in the sixteenth century speaks like the latest handbook on hypnotism,unmarked_contra
  the puppet show by marian bower constable  co all life is a puppet show from some peoples iioint of view and miss bower means no more by her title than that she is telling an ordinary human story her characters have motives one of them whose mother had been mad thinks that he will have to go mad also but comes round to the opposite opinion the men and women who come and go through this rather unconventional romance suffer or rejoice as most of us do in accord with their dispositions and actions and are in no way like puppets moving to strings the title has in fact little to do with the story which is a really readable account of a somewhat ordinary and cosmopolitan group of people it shifts from england to a continental health resort and is full of gossip scraps of characterization and little incidents and movements with not much of plot or cohesion it is nevertheless thoroughly sincere in tone and pathetic in parts the poor french girl at eulenville slowly dying of consumption is an excellent though a melancholy sketch and the doctors love story is managed with a good deal of quiet force and tenderness,unmarked_contra

and frankness with fadeh arnd youth in women and liking these qualities he also likes writing about them hence to those who are of mr daviss mind as i am for one mr daviss books are always welcome because although he is not subtle although he lacks the genius of his master in the  craft mr kipling mr davis is a good fellow and a very delightful writer and he has the art of sharing his stories hum as his countrymen say g gallegher  is one of the best short stories that we have the van bibber episodes are a continual joy and the princess aline  has more charm than hundreds of more pretentious fictions in the present volume  soldiers of fortune mr davis has given us his first long romance and i thank him for it unreservedly the hero of  soldiers of fortune  is robert clay a young civil engineer of extraordinary force of character cool brave longheaded humorous in every way admirablethe kind of man whom the boys old and youn a mr davis writes for will adopt as an ideal

langhamhis daughters and then transplant them all to a spanish dependency in south america in a state of revolution where mr laham has acquired halfadozen mountains of iron ore which are being worked under clays supervision then involve them in the civil war raging in the state and after hairbreadth escapes and some good fighting bring them safely through with clay as the accepted loverof the irresistible hope that is what mr davis has done and done excellently well it seems to me now and then he strains a point clay for instance is a shade too near perfection especially for a writer who laughs at ouidas crichtons he was brought up before the mast on an ocean tramp and quotes  the last ride together  but mr daviss faults are au for the readers benefit he never gives short measure the principal characters of the book are so attractive that one wparts from them with sorrow this is how in the words of the intrepid macwilliams hope is described fine sweet girl growled macwilliams i should hope so shes the best they dont make them any better than that and just think if shes like that now what will she be when shes grown upwhen shes learned a few things now her sisteryou can see lust what her sister will be at thirty and at fifty and at eighty shes thoroughbred and shes the most beautiful woman to look at i ever saw but my son she is too careful she hasnt any illusions and no sense of humour and a woman with no illusions and no sense of humour is going to be monotonous you cant teach her anything you cant imagine yourself telling her anything she doesnt know the things we think important dont reach her at all theyre not in her line and in everything else she knows more than we could even guess at but that miss hope its a privilege to show her about she wants to see everhi and learn every and and she goes poking her head into openings and down shafts like a little foxterer and shell sit still and listen with her eyes wide open the tears in them too and tale doesnt know ituntil you cant talk yourself for just looking at her one of the finest scenes in the book is that in which when the three menclay macwilliams and langhamafter the escape of madame alvarez are exposed in the open to the fire of a band of soldiers hope rescues them  as he spoke they saw the carriage plunging out of the shadow of the woods and the horses galloping toward them down the beach macwilliams gave a cheer of welcome  hurrah he shouted  its jose coming for us hes a good man well done jos6  he called i  thats not jose langham cried doubtfully peering through the moonlight  good god its hope he exclaimed he waved his hands frantically above his head  go back hope he cried  go back   but the carriage did not swerve on its way toward them they all saw her now

carries you along with him one need not wish for a better story of action than this it may not quite be life but that is one reason why i like it a fountain ssakd by sir walter besant chatto  windus sir walters taste for lovemaking is incorrigible he oonfesses as much himself or which is i suppose the same thing makes his autobiographical heroine confess it i this is a love story for my own part i do not believe that any others are worth reading i am indeed sincerely sorry for all poor women who have no love story of their own one must not magnify the passion of love but certainly there is no other passion that plays so important a part in this transitory life especially for my sex in  a fountain sealed  the ideal society is that of the quake4 represented by the heroines brother in whom religious fervour and shameless pursuit of worldly wealth go hand in hand sir walter has not hit upon a very original treatment of his theme this time the heroine breaks away from quakerism to the outer world of london and becomes the  divine nancy whom rumour assigned as an early flame to george the third sir walter reconstructs the story as he conceives it must have happened and puts it in the mouth of the lady this is her description of her lover ii i declare that if any young man whatever his rank bestowed upon me his affections in the springtime of my days when i posesseed some charms of face and form it was not on account of any allurements or snares but solely on account of those perfections which a generous and noble soul all out of his own nobility imagined in a woman all imperfections the more noble the lover the more heavenly becomes the woman of his imagination such a young man sees in the woman he loves a living well of virtue a sealed fountain a soul all beautiful within and without happy is the woman who is loved by so great a heart for even before her death she may be led upward so as to become an angel of heaven i am bound to say that this does not fit in with my conception of george m the hanoverians do not lend themselves readily to romance and sentimentalism and it does not fit in with the conduct of the story either the prince wooes nancy who is ignorant of his identity everybody else knows but nobody has the decency to tell her a marriage is on the very point of being celebrated when the prince learns the death of the old king his father  my lover my bridegroom who was never to be my husband stood with his face turned upwardsalas  away from his bride and his face was changed there was in it a new authority anew majestythat of the sovereign a new expressionthat of kingship t love had gone out of that face it wa ied with a new emotion the young king saw suddenly before him the vastness of his responsibilities the burden of

me mly brother will see thee what has passed i pray thee to forget thou art all goodness nancy farewell be happy he stooped and kissed my headand i fell back of course the story is put in the mouth of a lovesick woman but i should have been glad of a sign from sir walter besant that he personally agreed with me in thinking that his hero behaved throughout prince or no prince as a common cad but alas no sir walter is capable of irony but in this book irony is reserved not for the lover but for the quakers the historian has his somewhat heartless comment in the preface  youth is attracted by beauty of whatever rank it must be pleant for a prince to step outside his rank and for a time to be treated as an ordinary gentleman  soldiers of fortune by richard harding davis lilus trated by charles dana gibson 69 heinemani something like mr masons man of action appears again in mr daviss story a pioneer in remote regions of the world is strongly defined against a tamer society whose refinements and graces fascinate him and whose womankind he idealises in his loneliness but whatever be the points of resemblance they are obscured by the great fact that  sodiers of fortune is a thoroughly pleasant and cheerful story the literary man is not a cad and if the first fair lady of the heros choice is unsatisfactory she has a sister who is a trump and who behaves handsomely all the way through the book is a romance of the engineering world  there are no men today    who lead as picturesque lives as do civil engineers they are the bravest soldiers of the present day and they are the least recognised so says king the literary traveller and the story forces us to believe it though clays experiences including as they did not only tunnelling mountains diverting river beds bridging roaring canions but also stemming a revolution in a south american republic must be called exceptional then he was amply paid for his past life of lonely hardship for when the revolution camne he was made captain of the forces of order and the lady of his heart was there to see and to help the two keep up a merry game of alternately saving each others lives their pluck and devotion being equally matched and the horrors of slaughter and the fall of dictators hardly disturb only pleasantly entertain us serving merely as a lively spirited background and byplay to the love story

  the mutable many new novels by robert barr methuen  co mr barrs latest novel though it is of considerable length can be read throughout with little cessation of interest much pains has been bestowed on it an effort is made to avoid the elaboration of the obvious and commonplace incidents of the story and it is difficult to describe any portion of the book as being below the average level of the whole in form it consists of an account of the affairs of a large factory in london with the inevitable strikes and contests between the manager of the concern and the workpeople the managers only daughter is the heroine who is it must be confessed a somewhat conventional type of the young lady of the day but she is the only one of the dramatis persona to whom the epithet can be applied the workmen and their leaders are all carefully studied characters and they are well presented to the reader the novel rarely approaches to anything that is very great in art though there are indications that the writer is capable of very successful efforts it is pleasant to notice that the novel is devoid of the element of padding which so frequently marks the fiction of the time especially where the author is under a contract to write so many thousand words by a particular date and it would be hard to point to any portion of mr barrs  the mutable many which is slipshod or hasty in composition with regard to the class of roaders who are likely to be attracted by the volume it may be said that the book is as well suited to the drawingroom as it is to the club table the socalled art critic of

new novels the ambassadors by henry james methuen  co a chief aim of the art of novelwriting should be to conceal the fact that it is an art many of our presentday writers those above all unchastened by experience unconsciously deny this truth scorning to conceal their verbal cleverness they thrust it instead into the very nostrils of the reader confounding him with its savour mr henry james realizes it is easy to see the sinfulness of too openly rejoicing in his strength struggles against it as ardently as the most stern of religious devotees against bis physical self yet all the time with pleasant frequency through out his pages can be discovered evidences of temporary failure in the unequal struggle nevertheless the general effect is rather that of the athlete calmly conscious of his powers than of the would  be hercules anxious only to lavish what power he has upon the better displaying of it granting all this we find it hard to forgive such sentences as this  but why fondly as its so easy to imagine your clinging to it dont you put it away a query which might not unjustly be asked in clearer words of the author about the sentence itself or again  her thought fitted with a click in his endeavour to escape the obvious the author has evolved a thought which fits with an almost painfully audible click it would be ungracious however to harp too much upon these occasional spots which obscure so slightly the face of the sun like other of the authors works  the ambassadors is indubitably good work indeed as a study of life as it is lived in the world of fact rather than in the world of romance by real americans who from such places as wooilett massachusetts roam across the centuries to chester or to paris the book is altogether satisfying a sympathising hand rests as lightly upon lewis lambert strother ambassador most extraordinary as upon maria gostrey the lady whose thoughts fit rather loudly into their appropriate places or the oomtesse de vionnet giving to each its proper touch of illumination to each its due place in the scenery  fiction the ambassadors by henry james methuen 6s here is a book to appeal directly and intimately to mr jamess admirers it is indeed a book so individual so elusive so delicately wrought that only those who are as it were free of the authors dominions will pluck the heart out of it the subject has been treated before but never just in this way we have a young american in paris who is supposed to have gone down before the pleasurespell of the alluring city and to him is sent by the lads mother a man of middle age and presumably of experience to win him back to decency and america and dollars but the ambassador falls under the spell of the supposed prodigal under the spell too of the young mans exquisite surroundings and the glamour of paris and gradually he finds himself on the other side with his defection other ambassadors arrive from america but they too are thrown out of their original course by the new world which opens before them the whole thing is conceived with that delicate and ironic humour with that playful but profound insight which make mr jamess work so continually fresh and compelling he has the faculty for expressing in dialogue the instant changes and preoccupations which are of the essence of thought as it flashes between sympathetic or antagonistic minds he has too the faculty for touching though with almost a coy tenderness the deeper springs of feeling the triumph of this book consists mainly in the character of the original ambassador the man who begins and ends as a failure but who is always right in instinct and lives in a kind of abstracted fineness of atmosphere the minor characters are ahnost as good particularly two of the women the setting is admirable mr james in the earlier chapters has touched on chester with curious suggestiveness and in paris he is always at home,unmarked_contra

attention is exceedingly roused by this character but it is entirely in the excitation of a curiosity by a species of unaccountable versatility which is very poorly accounted for the hero julian peveril we have already said is nobody  and his counterpart alice however lovely in description is in action nothing at all and is this ailby no means for how could the author of  waverley dispense with the agency of a something mysterious and fantastic  in the present instance the personification is peculiarly grotesque the intriguer christian has a natural daughter by a moorish female whom if we un derstand the story fright he disposes of in her infancy to a dutch tumbler but afterwards redeems on a supposition of making her useful to his purposes this girl ie ted to hekere that his executed brother is her father and in eon sequence is induced to counterfeit deafness and dumbness in which supposed state she is received as a sort of elfin attendant on the countess of derby whose destruction is sought and whose most secret intentions she thereby gets at without suspicion this feasible scheme is however defeated by her imbibing an uncontrollable penchant for julian peveril who being related to the countess ia brought up with her son the young earl of derby and in consequence thrown in the way of this mysterious attendant when therefore he is induced to take some dangerous packets to the catholic friends of the countess during the ferment created by the popish plot she attends him from time to time as a kind of esprit follet until at length we find her a woman of wit speech and spirit although doomed to love in vain and to intrigue to no purpose either for her father or herself the dark moorish yet piquant aspect the slight symmetrical person profusion of dark hair and almost supernatural agility from her education in the tumbling line altogether make up a perfect nondescript and we fear not a very happy one the general conception approaches to j extravagance and the action assigned to it is almost ridiculous only think ladies of a girt agreeing to act deafness pand dumbness for several years and to be pitied and durwarded m such by the man she adored i eran in romance there should be some verisimilitude  upon the whole we think that  peveril and  nigel jjnjr rank pea on a par although charles ii falls tar tefamd jamesil in happiness of

in the year of jubilee by george gissing 3 vols lawrence and butler eves ransom by george gissing lawrence and butler mr gissing is one of the most difficult of all novelists to review fairly when a mood is on him he is relentless in its expression he gives us no relief from it a less able writer would bore us mr gissing never does at his worst he rasps us and makes us flee to fairyland from his terrible array of hard facts in his determination to suppress nothing of the ugliness of the life he paints lower middleclass life by preference he often forgets to take account of the sunlight which is as much a reality as fog if something rarer he feels too strongly to be simply accurate and all through his sincere and honest and merciless and powerful stories we are making mental reservations and combating but combating mostly let us admit the unessentials he forces us to acknowledge that the truth is generally with him this is a somewhat belated review of  in the year of jubilee which most of his readers will already have judged for themselves to those who have not it may be said that the title is significant of nothing in particular or of some truism such as in the year of her gracious majestys jubilee all was not well with england and with camberwell in particular it is a book which every writer and reader must respect marked by good thorough work a very rare knowledge of human nature the absence of all tawdriness all flabbiness in thinking and sentiment at the same time an event a very significant event in the history of the heroine one of the most attractive of mr gissings women is entirely incredible it is no good putting us off with generalities about the unaccountableness of human nature mr gissings business was to convince us that it happened to this particular girl for all he says we reply that it didnt otherwise the story is true cruelly true to a dreary life the hero is admirable if he were ever to become a good man at all it must have been in just such a way turning into one of the most insufferable domestic tyrants we have ever met with in fiction or life whose latter end of respectability is save perhaps to his own immediate belongings worse than the reckless cruelty of his earlier days artistically he is a great success we hope mr gissing did not desire to engage our sympathies for him into the story has been worked a wealth of sensible thought and wellmade characters more than we have room to refer to now but the object of a great deal of mr gissings bitter satire is worth calling attention tothe modern education which unintelligently applied contributes as little to the culture and growth of the mind and heart and soul as if it were conducted in chinese eves ransom is shorter with much fewer personages and perhaps less careful workmanship but unless we are bought and our judgement dazzled by the unusual ray of brightness at the end which made our hearts glad as mr gissings words seldom do it is on the whole a better a more harmonious story mr gissing hates poverty with a burning hatred that it makes for virtue he thinks an unholy lie as of course it is all our modern philanthropy declares the lie but we cant still in words so he gives his hero the chance of a few years cessation from rinding labour the chance of seeing life of feeding his mind and his eye and you can feel his glow of exaltation in his heros freedom but he does not let him have his swing he makes him fall in love forces on him a big sacrifice and gives him nothing in return but the knowledge that he has saved the girl he loves from misery and perhaps from degradation there he leaves him but with a song in his heart and the echo of that song we hope to hear in later novels for after all it is sung in the actual hard world that mr gissing faces so fearlessly eve the complicated young woman for whom the sacrifice was made is worth our interest mr gissing is one of the very few novelists besides mr hardy who dares to endow his attractive heroines with real live faults not only magnificent and interesting vices but mr gissing is apt to take up a scolding and sometimes a priggish attitude towards his women which is for all purposes absolutely useless this observation is however not particularly suggested by eve or by  eves ransom the story is a page of real life not the life that charms us but life at least and we are more understanding towards our fellowbeings after reading it,unmarked_contra

the poetical work8 of edgar allans poe illus trated edinburgh alexander hislop and co it is one of the misfortunes attendant upon the absence of an international copyrightlaw between this country and america that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an american author in decent type and paper the reason is obvious the market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions that render such an effort much too risky hence it is that american literature whichwith all deference be it spokenshould not scorn adventitious aids is generally associated with dirty grey paper bad type small size and insecure binding let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read romeo juliet published in the form of a dirty tract which may be had in holywell street for twopence let him turn to his own large clear wellprinted edition and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace and light and sweetness that it did not possess before we are glad to perceive therefore that edgar allan poe unquestionably the greatest genius that america has yet producedis at length offered to english readers in a handy and presentable form with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper but it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems failure might have been anticipated at the beginning it was a priori as impossible to translate the dreamlike beauty of annabel lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano the illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e g one or two chaming little landscapes by mr macwhirter but to begin at the beginning did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than mr c j staniland has done with the  raven did mr staniland fancy that this was a comic poem  we find a hideously ugly boy seated in an annchair before a fire the room being filled with ghouls and spirits that remind us of the mnagic weene in der pieibchutz done iu a cuwtlty theatre what these tawdry devils have to do with the weird simplicity of the poem we are at a loss to make out but this is nothing to the final scneu in which the boy is found lying on the

best edition of poes poems we know of  the complete works of bret harte collected and revised by the author vol x tales of trail and town 6s chatto and windus the library edition of the works of bret harte is now complete in ten volumes the publishers have done their part well so far as binding and type are concerned though some readers may regret that none of the excellent illustrations which have adorned the earlier editions appear in the new one many reputations have been made and have passed since bret harte gave us the luck of roaring camp and hardly one has stood the test of constant production like his he is now what he was in his early days a writer of excellent stories with a sense of fine workmanship which he has never outraged the present volume contains tales that have already from a photo by john ruskin i886 bari aud proved their power of giving delight but mostly of a recent enough date to be still new to many readers  the poetical works of edgar allan poe with a notice of his life and genius by james hannay 1 esq with twenty illustrationssome of these twenty illustrations are gracefully fantastic the biographical notice is perversely sentimental the story of poes life was told by himself so largely and loudly to the public by the daily papers of america that to attempt to colour over its shames with sympathy and apology is idle the poems with their strange unwholesome unequal vigour nightmare verses if such things can be speak for themselves their writer apart from his works had best be forgotten  literature the works of edgar allan poe edited by john h ingram vols i and ii containing the collected tales london and edinburgh adam  charles black 1874 with jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although mr ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume i do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good

thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories they are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable if anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable

droll stories from the abbeys of touraine translated into english complete and un  abridged london chatto  windus 1874 people who reproduce recondite or obsolete literary garbage occupy a position which it is easy for them to defend and which it is difficult to assail to find fault with their wares is to advertise them and to expose the reviewer to the easy charge of prudery it often happens too that there is here and there a jewel hidden in the dunghills of the past some pure song among the many base ones of th6ophile vian some fact of historical value in the gossip of mrs aphra behn it is a pity that the student should not have such books always beside him as if the poorest student had not easy access to them in public libraries still there is this shadow of au excuse for many reprints of books which are meant to appeal only to prurient curiosity and when they are pro duced with some care and costliness in type and paper the chances are that they will not fall into the hands of readers whom they are likely to injure none of the excuses we have mentioned can be urged by the translator and the pub lishers of balzacs contes drolatiques the translator says in his preface in france the work has long been regarded as a classicas a faithful picture of the last days of the mayen dge when kings and princesses brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants in england the difficulties of the language employed and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the french of the sixteenth century taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages the archaeological value it must alwats possess for the student and the dramatic interest of its stories the translator has thought that an english edition of balzacs chef dceuvre would be acceptable to many no doubt it would and no doubt a translation of the marquis de sades chefdceuvres or of any other  scrofulous french novel would be acceptable to many but the translator like everyone else must be per fectly aware that the historical information of the book is absolutely worthless that it has no archaeological value at all except in the same sense as esmoncd has archaeological value that is as an imitation of the style and manners of the past and the style and lan guage of the contes drolatiques are not nearly so successful in this direction as esmond is the old french is like no old french in par ticular indeed it resembles nothing so much as the bastard old english of lady novelists who put ys for is and spell the ye and begin all the substantives with a capital letter there is no philological instruction to be got from this kind of thing and even if there were it would be lost in a translation to be sure the translator does his best by using some fine old examples of wellknown errors in english grammar such as  the wise man would lay at full length in a ditch to translate balzacs conte8 drolatiques then is inexcusable on historical or antiquarian grounds even beroalde de verville has the value of being the exponent of the nastiness of a past age but there is no historical value in a modern imitation of beroalde de verville and even if the cn ies were useful to the student a student so advanced ought to be able to read them in the original french nor has the book the excuse of being published at a price beyond the humblest purse or in a form meant to please the lover of beautiful typography it is got up like the boys books that are current at christmas and an illiterate but wellmeaning grand mother might probably give it to a boy now even the author would have objected to this for when balzac in the preface to the first edition defended his work as a work of art he also said that it was intended pour lea lecteura choiie the present translation appeals to the public at large to a public which has none of the education that would enable it to appreciate the art without taking harm from the grossness the contes drolatique is a fair example of the baser work of the romantic school of 1830 it deals with mediaeval themes and the author thoroughly enters into the horror and the lust which inform the grotesque of the middle ages in the voice and with a cracked imitation of the ringing laugh of rabelais he tells tales more filthy than any in the collection of the cure of meudon and morehateful in theircruelty than most that disgrace the records of crime in the middle ages theserecords are dreadful enough but they are at least human in their earnestness men were cruel because they were terrified but it is scarcely human to take such themes for art a gross age laughed grossly but there is something apish in the imitative and affected ribaldry of a refined age a cruel age acted with cruelty but there is something of the tiger in the artist who in a humane age gloats over torture like all balzac did his contes drolatiques are works of patient art look at the story of la succube it is a masterpiece of the romantic school the blind gropings of pedants in the mysteries of nature and of law are reproduced with the skill of michelet a glamour of moorish colour a savour of exotic fragrance hangs about the vampire but in place of the indignation of michelet there is only a sound of mocking laughter and everywhere in the book in every page we are reminded that this is the work of that balzac after reading whom saintebeuve said he felt like one unclean the book is full of art but to translate it for english people is to perpetrate another of the many crimes that are done in the name of art in this sabbat of satyrs and obscene witches among these foul scandals of monasteries and shadows of nameless sins there appears here and there the face of a woman that is not wholly vile or of a knight that was not merely a lecher but there is none of the tender poetry the pure love that redeem the coarseness of boccaccio the romantic school has scarcely produced a more hideous work or one so likely to do mischief in an english form the volume is illustrated with dores famous woodeuts now very worn and ob scure mr hamerton and mr ruskin did full justice to these drawings while they were still confined to a book that was not likely to find its way into schoolrooms it may be observed that the publishers have chosen to mutilate mr ruskins observations in their catalogue he did not end when he had

vivid realism and grim humour concerning the lives of some avorkingmen who with himself were associated with a firm of house painters and decorators in a provincial town in the course of a aolume extending to nearly 400 pages he shows us the sordid lives of these men their opinions of other sections of humanity  their attitude towards politics in general and their views of socialism in particular we follow the author with interest as he faithfully records the hopes and fears that animate his comrades their fatalistic philosophy of life and their dull round of toil displayed in the avorkshop and by their relations with the  boss  and the foreman a zolaesque character nicknamed  old misery the struggle of the women is also depicted and thc tragedies of the children in homes where

bending down over the cradle arranging thc coverings which the restless movements of the child had disordered she was crying silently unnoticed by her husband  for months pastin fact ever since the child was born she had been existing without sufficient food if easton was unemployed they had to stint themselves so as to avoid getting further into debt than was absolutely necessary when he was working they had to go short iii order to pay avliat they owed but of what there was easton himself without knowing it always had the greater share if he was at work she would pack into his

below the average and we feel a measure of sympathy with the impatience that his fellowworkers expressed at the authors socialistic discourses there is a measure of truth in the latters contention that they are not informed as to the rootcause of poverty the nearest ave get to it is that it is the outcome of private monopoly today it is too much the fashion to shelter the individual behind the

poor painters who work for a slavedriving firm is terribly realistic the complete knowledge of the miserable conditions under which they lived is certainly firsthand the dialogue is of the kind not likely to be overheard loose jests oaths and curses with a perpetual use of the forbidden word it is a painful and possibly only too true picture of labour under its worst conditions but the real purpose of the book cannot be mistaken it is merely the repetition of wornout attacks on christianity and the exploitation of an impossible and utopian scheme of socialism in the form of speeches and lectures put into the mouth of the painter owen in a style and manner quite different from the rest of the bookin fact a rather weak essay on socialism laboured into the rough and ready dialogues of

alone in west africa by mary gaunt werner laurie the avidity with which travel books are sought after by the public is apt to thrust into the market a type of descriptive work which wilfully trades upon the readers curiosity the principle of  omne ignotum pro magnifico focuses attention on the unknown country rather than the qualities that go to the visualising of it and tends to submerge critical acumen to avoid careful study becomes an acute temptation for this reason and on account of the multiple and disconnected impressions left by a book of this nature personality is invaluable in supplying unity and distinction and fixing a rallyingpoint for the reader mrs gaunts new book fulfils this demand it is not so much that her personality is virile and commanding as that it is sufficient to cut a way for the reader through the jungle of her journeys her salient capacity is a surprising and quickening commonsense she refuses to take things on trust alert enough to test all she hears and sees by her own experience our sole objection to her lucid and conscientious narrative is that she tends to lapse into impressionistic journalism the purely descriptive portions of her adventurous jaunt through littleknown districts in west africa do not call for detailed treatment mrs gaunt started up the gambia from bathurst through the  groundnut colony a land of promise so far as productivity is concerned she skirted sierra leone the white mans grave  staying a short time at its dirty illkempt capital freetown and spent some interesting days in liberia autonomous since 1822 through the courageous experiment of america for the semicultured native she has scant praise insisting on his boorishness his arrogance his raw and blatant egoism passing through the guinea coast almost fabulous in its natural beauties she reached half assinie and the french border from elmina the old portuguese mining settlement her pilgrimage took her to accra the capital of the gold coast colony up the volta to the krobo hills infamous for the mystic bloodorgies there practised by the nearly savage inhabitants over the eketo range and so to the border into the german colony of togo thence she travelled along the coast to the best point of vantage and turned inland into ashanti which has cost england so much money and so many lives and finally dipped down from kumasi its capital to the atlantic seaboard at sekondi where her route ended like another district which we deal with elsewhere much of this country had not been traversed before by a white woman mrs gaunts facile and rather gusty style never drifts into mere enumeration of peoples places and incidents her versatility is such that wherever she goes she kindles her narrative with patches and splashes of colour particularly illuminating are her hard penetrating comments on the prevailing fetishism concerning the west african climate the theory current as to its unredeemed vileness has she observes crystallised into superstition officials go there in confident expectation of having their energies enervated and paralysed by its humidity and in a spirit of calculated disgust they flout nature by burning the candle at both ends by falling into sedentary habits and a dumb mental resentment opposed to physical wellbeing so the consequent illhealth is as much the result of internal as extraneous causes it may be readily imagined how much the administration of the country suffers when activities but halfhearted and almost morose are applied to it mrs gaunts picture of the germans as colonisers of togo is in striking contrast to the verdict just given of their alertness regularity and cheerfulness she speaks in terms of ungrudging admiration their keen and trenchant methods of organisation she opposes to the british lack of plan and casual attitude without attempting to draw invidious comparisons she speaks of the presence of broad long roads the facilities for transit the instinct for governing the scientific warfare against sleeping sickness the insistence on cleanliness and order and the anxiety to preserve natural beauties where  england seems indifferent if the beautiful spot be not within the narrow seas german women too live with their husbands in togo their helpmeets there as at home englishmen on the other hand regard such itinerant companionship as akin to sacrilege the tropics are  no white womans country immorality and discontent are the outcome so far as ashanti is concerned however mrs gaunt is less dispiriting there a succession of zealous administrators have rescued the country from internecine strife strong measures have had the stimulating effect required concerning the vexed and seemingly inscrutable problem of the native population mrs gaunt is more reticent than we could wish her conclusions are enigmatic varying in accordance with the different status of the aborigines in different parts the halfemancipated native with his veneer of culture still she declares retains the rudiments of barbarism combined with the less agreeable characteristics of civilization his isolation from both white and black and his incapacity are complete for the primitive majority she veers towards the theory of a  benevolent despotism that depends for its validity on the temperament of the despot with whom unlimited authority is hardly favourable to the growth of sympathy and understanding and is apt to become inoculated with the virus of caesarism such are the scope and achievement of mrs gaunts bookone fertile in suggestion felicitous in style

basque legends  collected chiefly in the la bourd by the rev wentworth webster u a a is with an essay on the basque language by m julien vinson griffith  farran so difficult is the basque language that tradition asserts that the prince of darkness himself was obliged to abandon it in despair after having spent seven whole years in fruitlessly attempting to learn it as a specimen of the grammatical complications in which those who study it from without are involved may be mentioned one of the peculiarities of the conjugation of its verb the possession namely on the part of that verb of eleven moods and ninetyone tenses variable according to the sex or rank of the person addressed no wonder that as m vinson says in the tough but valuable essay appended to the present work the basque language is one which is particularly attractive to specialists it may be assumed however that the majority of the readers of mr websters pretty collection of  legends will not be profoundly interested in that tongue in spite of the fact that  its place in the general series of idioms has at last been well defined  it is an agglutinative and incorporating language with some tendency to polvsynthetism it consequently finds a place in the second great morphological linguistic group between the finnic and the north american family of languages like etruscan it has always possessed a fascination for the amateur as well as the professional philologist and over it as over etruscan the amateur has before now experienced some heavy falls the keen and by no means inexcusable desire of many a dilettante linguist is to grapple at once with the hardest problems which have baffled whole generations of trained scholars and about the origin and affinities of both basque and etruscan such things have been said as might well make the old inhabitants of etruria and the pyrenees turn in their urns or their graves or at least put on record a remonstrance through the medium of a table but the book now before us does not sin in this direction m vinson speaks with authority and his remarks must be listened to with respect and so few englishmen have taken the trouble to learn basque that mr webster thoroughly deserves all possible encouragement to continue his labours and to give the world more of the fruits arising from them but in writing about the  legends  of the basques he must proceed with rather more caution than is shown in his present book his knowledge of popular tales in general appears to be mainly drawn from mr campbells  tales of the west highlands an admirable book but one which throws light upon but a small portion of a very wide field the natural consequence of this is that mr webster is always laying stress upon similarities between the basques and the kelts it is not clear whether he suspects that their languages are akin but he evidently imagines that basque popular tales are more allied with keltic than with any other similar stories we have chosen the designation keltic he says  because the burning question concerning the basques at present is their relation to the keltic race undoubtedly the question is a burning one in one sense anybody who takes it up without very special knowledge of both basque and keltic is exceedingly likely to burn his fingers he goes on to say what is perfectly true that the basque stories are like the keltic but he adds  whether they have a closer affinity with them than with the general run of indoeuropean mythology may be an open question it may seem so to mr webster who does not once refer to and therefore may be supposed to be unacquainted with the works of yon hahn bernhard schmidt and others on modern greek folklore or those of gonzenbach and pitrc on sicilian popular tales or of wenzig on west slavonian or of schott on wallachian  or of vuk karadjich and mijatovics on servian not to speak of the numerous untranslated works with which a western critic cannot fairly be expected to be familiar of course be was by no means bound to read the whole literature of folktales before bringing out a collection of basque legends but it is dangerous for an editor who has not done so to indulge in critical observations on the origin of the stories he introduces to the public to the scientificcomparerof stories the basque tales will offer little that is new but he will be glad to possess them for they to some extent fill up a gap which has long remained open it was supposed by some comparative mythologists that the basque legends as being those of a people quite distinct at all events linguistically from the aryan family would offer new features but those which mr webster has laid before us possess little novelty as he himself remarks some are closely allied with keltic tales others are evidently versions of modern french stories of the perrault and daulnoy type the supernatural beings however who figure in them are interesting the basa jaun and basa andre or ogre and ogress and the lamiiiak or fairies the legends also about the herensuge the basque representative of the serpent or dragon family so notorious in popular fiction are important if they are trustworthy some of the casual references in the tales to sorcery are very interesting the basques are great believers in magic and witches used to flourish amongst them in spite of pierre de lancre who by the terrors of his hideous inquisition in 1609 produced a moral epidemic and burnt numerous victims at st jean de luz the last person thus put to death there was a portuguese lady who was charged in 1619 with secreting the host for magic purposes while her case was being investigated in the church a number of fishermen about to start for newfoundland who dared not set sail while such a crime was unpunished seized upon her and burnt her facts of this kind are always worth recording if mr webster will give us a book about the basques made up of such facts or of popular fictions carefully sifted and printed without other comment than may be demanded by difficulties arising from basque words or customs and the likethat is to say without theories hypotheses or mythological comparisons or explanationsthen he will be conferring a real benefit on the small number of readers who know a little about the basques and the great number to whom the language and literature of those  aborigines are entirely unknown,unmarked_contra

the manxman mr hall caines new novel like the greater part of his work indeed has one special and noticeable quality it forces you to feel how straight out of his heart he writes a few other writers of fiction today may have equal emotional intensity but they are either careful to hide it or unable to express it he backs up this warmth of feeling by much else it is trueby humour by observation by excellent workmanship the manxman is a very full book fuller even than the deemster and  the bondman appealing to varied interests expending a lavish amount of material and showing no thinness or flimsiness anywhere still its special power over readers is emotional a power great and dangerous his keen appreciation of humour may generally be trusted to keep this other and stronger quality within bounds but one lights on a spot now and again where the atmosphere is sickly because the wholesome airs of humour have ceased for the moment to blow the novel is a tribute to his beloved island warmer even than  the deemster to the character of its people  the manxman by hall caine 6s heinemann to the picturesqueness of their simple lives it is in a sense a book of manx folklore and the

the crackling blaze and tried to forget that they had forgotten teatime 1 we never has to mind a bit of hungry said philip stoutly never a haporth said pete only when the jobs done we have hams and

appoints his doineymolla or manpraiser a post that demands intercession for the lover with the parents before betrothal and during the lovers absence attention to and protection of the lady philip has not allowed his education and conditions to separate him from his old comrade but his friendship does not protect him from temptation neither he nor katherine proves worthy of the guileless trust reposed in them pete comes home a rich man but not so rich in gold as in love for kate and his friend worldly prospects and the story of his own unequally mated father and mother keep philip from preventing the marriage but the woman unable long to bear her false position leaves her husband and is hid by ner old lover mr caine has attempted a great task in following the inner life of philip a man of sensitive soul of great talents and distinguished by fortune feeling himself every day more corrupted and degraded by a secret sin that brings him no gratification high or low the hunting of philip by his fortune and his conscience raises the book to a high tragic level kate in a sudden burst of unselfishness goes away but misfortune follows her and on her return she has to appear before philip the deemster on a charge of attempting her own life and is committed to gaol divorce proceedings with closed doors sever her from pete dis tinctions are showered on philip and his secret is safe but at the great ceremony of his appointment as governor he refuses the honour makes public confession goes to the prison and leads kate out a comparison here is inevitable the scene challenges comparison as voluntarily as do the turners hung side by side with the claudes in the national gallery if it is not longer than the one our mind reverts to it is too long and too unrestrained it does not thrill like  at last at last i stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward sustains me at this dreadful moment from grovelling down upon my face  lo the scarlet letter which hester wears ye have all shuddered at it wherever her walk hath beenwherever so miserably burdened

shuddered  perhaps it is not comparison alone that harms it philips creator will have him expiate his sin to the last among those who had held him in honour and will have him marry katherine they walk out of the story with a halo but what of philips heritage of weakness that had already driven him to intemperance and in katherine there was no nobility hers is a poor nature capable of better moments sufring curbs passion and often refines human nature but it cannot essentially change it and readers interested in these two cannot leave them with the thought they have found peace they had both suffered enough to have paid the price of death for one at least philips story and petes character are the outstanding features of the book pete is a real creation humorous unconsciously poetical and of a trustfulness in a shaky world heartbreaking to behold when he knows not where kate has gone he invents sublime falsehoods to account for her disappearance and you never heard tell of him not

tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a nobleman thus addresses i

thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed

mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be

the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the

to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his

mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen

the position of peggy harper by leonard merrick nelson  sons mr leon abd merrick has the virtue rare among english storywriters of being an accomplished craftsman any young person who wishes to acquire the difficult art of telling a story might advantageously spend a week or two in studying the first halfdozen pages of  the position of peggy harper before those six pages are ended three things have happened to the reader  he has been made acquainted with a whole family circle the vague phrase  going on the stage  has been translated for him into terms of fact and his interest has been taken captive the narrative closely woven throughout occupies only about thirty thousand wordsthe third part of an ordinary sixshilling novel yet all the substance of a fullsized novel is here and the better for its compression everything not strictly relevant has had to go everything slack or wordy has had to be packed tighter  but because mr merrick knows his business well not a single essential word has slipped away technical skill however though the most unusual is not the greatest merit of the book there is an excellent central idea the characters are true to fife and all of them excepting perhaps the odious ross and the unexceptionable theodosia are alive in short 4 the position of peggy harper is a remarkably good novela better novel indeed than its popular predecessor  the house of lynch but it is not probable that it will attain to equal popularity because it is conceived and executed in a spirit of irony utterly abhorrent to the gentle sentimentalists who make up it is to be feared the majority of modern novelreaders  the position of peggy harper fiction stories of the stage by leonard merrick  coloured frontispiece thomas nelson and sons 2s net from stage to peerage an autobiography by florence warden digby long and co 6s only an actress by  rita stanley paul and co 6d many stories have been written about the stage and  the profession  in general but we doubt if there has been one more true to life than the position of peggy harper mr merricks characters are living ones and may be met with at any time in theatrical circles while the incidents he describes are of almost everyday occurrence in the life of the mummer as for instance the visits to agents and the first meeting between chris and peggy when each is seeking an engagement the description of a touring company at rehearsal before taking the road is capitally done and the way in which the actormanager deals with chris and his melodrama may be read with profit by all wouldbe dramatic authors peggy pitiably rehearsing the part of leading lady is a scene that could only have been written by one thoroughly au fait with matters histrionic but her tribulations end with her engagement to lord gapenhurst and her picture in a society journal chris having previously married theodosia who wrote for the press and is the means of introducing the reader to the journalistic world miss wardens heroine sylvia lutterworth nee sally solomon also marries the scion of a noble house as the title of her story implies he is lord redbrook a little fair fighthaired lighteyed pallid creature who rejoices in two pet namesbunny and pinkieand might with equal propriety be called gudgeon for quite early in the story he is hooked by edith selons who plays him through several chapters only to see him landed at the end by  jewy sylvia  from stage to peerage  is most entertaining reading from start to finish and we consider it one of the best novels miss warden has given us  the episode of ella wylde the faithless wife dying of consumption is forcibly told and that and other dramatic incidents will remind the reader of zola at his best only an actress is one of ritas  short stories now issued in the popular  clear type  series but which probably first saw the light many years ago it differs from the two others insomuch that the actressheroine diesvery dramatically on the stageand the noble lord who had jilted her takes a bride from his own set it is a pathetic tale but rather nambypamby in parts,unmarked_contra
new novels pig8 in clover by frank danby heine mann frank danby falls between two stools the opening chapters of  pigs in clover give promise of an interesting study of english life on normal levels but we are disappointed on the entrance of karl althaus the south african millionaire several characters including a woman whose luckless blood is scientifically inherited from a demirep have a life and reality of their own but alas this does not carry us beyond the first sixty pages with karl althaus the novel takes a turn for the worse and becomes quite another thing with long lanes that seemingly have no ending and a mesh of characters and interests that are disproportionate and out of perspective there is for example mrs de groot who is described as the author of the kaffir and his master and who is also represented as making common cause with the prime minister of cape colony against the boers althaus is one of the hebrew millionaires who threw in their lot with the late cecil rhodes the advisability the taste and even the practicability of introducing contemporary people into modern fiction are open to doubt but we should say that there could be no question as to the verdict on the course frank danby has seen fit to adopt if through her delay says the prime minister of cape colony when the jameson raid is reported to him her damnable calm and red tape there is a hair of one of those mens heads injured ill pull the place down upon her i ii make hell through the length and breadth of the by continent this is the style in which he is made to talk to althaus and which should make the blood of history curdle karl althaus jew is a noble creature as all millionaires must be on the other hand louis althaus half gentile is a scoundrel and mrs de groot is a fool we should not have dwelled upon the unsatisfactory nature of this novel had we not seen in it the germs of something really good as it is frank danby seems to us to have simply wasted her material  pigs in clover by frank danby heinemann 6s there are two ways of pessimism in art one tnices the cruelty of circumstance the other of humanity from this passionate novel which we have seen miscalled  smart we cull a sentence that shows frank danbys way of pessimism  the bright elusive womanhood which had bewitched karl louis saw shy and wild and he wanted it as men always want to bring down wild things it is then a woman whom we see piloted into tragedy in reading these pages and in fact they reveal two women whom charon could hardly have conducted to shores gloomier than those they reached one is a politicians neglected daughter whose quixotic generosity entraps her into a foul marriage whence she emerges a creature who  always did what she was told the other is an author famous for a novel of south africa and she is the bright elusive lady in our quotation the man whom she thought might inspire a chapter wheedles her into adultery snubs her pen into silence finally lays his mean and faithless spirit bare before her yet never calls to the loving animal in her nature without shaking her with a frenzy of obedience for he is essentially belami a creature with genius in his flesh like the debauched journalist who prowls through de maupassants immortal pigstye there is no escape from his evil allurements save by death or flight imagine these women moving in the highest circles about the time of the jameson raid imagine finance in hundreds of thousands and controlling them a great softhearted jew who bawls that wrhen the jew is honoured as a jew he will shout in his synagogue  i believe in christ thank the great god i can say it now there is indeed plenty of bustle and chatter and actuality to persuade us that joan and aline are women of an unremote yesterday the vulgar references to gladstone are to ba regretted and it must be confessed that the identification of fictitious persons with public events is managed rather unadroitly one suspects a roman  def but there is neither losk nor key the strength and intensity of the novel however are beyond dispute  pigs in clover by frank danby 6s heinemann the two persons in  pigs in clover with whom one always remains in complete sympathy are the rugged greathearted millionaire karl althaus and the sad sweet little englishwoman joan separated from the dutch husband she does not love the soulless effeminate nearly allconquering louis althaus karls adopted brother is one of the most graceless and contemptible scoundrels that ever stained the pages of a novel he is drawn vividly and with a merciless insightso too is the unhappy aline hayward though towards the close when she is louis wife and when karl who has loved joan from the first persuades her to marry him having learned how she has been betrayed and deserted by the brother he now disowns it is difficult to believe that even aline could be so innocently impervious to friendly warnings while louis and joan renew their old acquaintance in karls absence and that when she finds joan weeping in louis arms she did not grasp the full significance of the situation unless we accept her as a wholly irresponsible imbecile alines earlier schoolgirl romance and its culmination in marriage smith the drunken jockey jack forrest are admirably well done and the hiding of that scandal and the farreaching consequences of it all help in the shaping of a well imagined and ingeniously constructed plot frank danbvs references to the late mr gladstones home rule policy are as gratuitously insolent as her shrieking admiration of the jameson raiders is hysterical but away from such debatable ground in south africa before the war in london financial circles in various phases of political and social life the story is convincingly realistic and is written with a skill and dramatic picturesqueness that should ensure its popularity  pigs in clovek by frank danby a long story of modern political and social life the father of the heroine was a rising politician whose career is described with frequent reference to recent political events aline makes a tragic marriage in the third chapter and then we are in the whirlpool there are jews millionaires politicians dukes south african speculators and all the familiar figures of this school of contemporary romance part of the action takes place at the cape heinemann 6s,unmarked_contra

originally chose beginning life as a northumberland herdboy he was  literally charmed by dr watts but springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration he dashed into a style resembling the minor
