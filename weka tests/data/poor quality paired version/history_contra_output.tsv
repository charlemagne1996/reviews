B6013,['8965023'],  the siege of florence an historical romance by daniel mcarthy ksq  vols colhurn in the notice of mrs gores  dowager we took occasion to call the attention of our readers to the present state of literature iu its moro popular departments and to its intimate connexion with certain particulars in the actual phasis of societya truth as we conceive of primary importance and hitherto much overlooked of these particulars the most remarkable perhaps is the increased demand for books and a consequent rapidity of intellectual productions among the many influences exerted by this cause there is one suiliciently obviousami that is a proportionate exhaustion affecting at  once the imagination of though author and the exi citability of the public it is not that the comi binations of nature or of society when measured  against human power are practically less than i infinite or that under any circumstances newfields would be waining to the operations of genius imt then it is genius alone that can  discover them md genius is not to be cleated at pleasure by a mere demand for its exercise when hoxvever inventive genius docs arise and it has extorted from society an approbation for its novelties they are seized upon forthwith by a host of innovators the forms are multiplied and the beauties frittered away in endless repetitions each for the most part differing from its predecessor only in thc inferiority of its execution the nexv form is no sooner recognized than it is worn to a thread  or if in a few splendid and exceptional cases superior p o xve rs  of combination are manifested they are still  manifested to a disadvantage for the public satiated with the overwrought model responds  not to the stimulus and receive with indilleri euee excellencies which formerly would have obtained signal success this forms a state of things equally irksome to both parties and both endeavour to escape from it through channels unfavourable to thc best interests of literaturethat is through an abandonment of simplicity and truth and the search after monstrous excitements from the most illegitimate sources there is on the part of the public a demand for what may bc termed a literary draindrinking and on the part of authors and cf publishers there is not wanting it corresponding eagerness to work thc illegal still and to serve the hot and poisonous product as much above proof as the strength if their alembic will admit it is the curse of all vicious excitement to provoke a desire for perpetually increasing stimuli and in the search after the means of gratifying this desire authors are bent on outdoing at all risks the former outdoiugs of their predecessors one writer labours to make his murders more niurdcrnti hi desperadoes more desperate his embroglios more embroiled and his moving accidents by flood and field more moving more unexpected and more impossible to all such series however there is a necessary term  the spring on which they are destined to act loses its elasticity and exaggeration defeats its own end nor is this term placed at any very remote distance others therefore abandoning the substance seek only to exaggerate the forms and throw themselves for ellect on the production of some absurd novelty of style such are the germanisms of recent introduction quaintnesses or a gorgeousness and a stilted elevation of expression which is neither prose nor verse but a condensed essence of the defects of both forcibly feeble and pompously inane and these affectations arc brought to bear upon worncut and cllote themes as the tinselled trappings of a theatrical wardrobe are sometimes employed to conceal thc mean and distorted figure of a wouldbe stage adonis others again place their hopes of success upon

represent some passing form of society richardson ridding smollett lnchhald and though modem fashionable novelists have all nlikc attempted at least to copy after some definite nature a part therefore of their relative excellencies must depend on the value ol the specific nature they have been employed to copy just as may be observed in thc comparison ol the dutch and italian masters hut one d the most striking characteristics of progressing civilization is an increasing smoothness of the surfaces of society a gradual merging of the individual in the common characteristics of the masses the

necessary nor lawful to pav fadiion too usurps a wider nnd a more tyrannical sway  and thc animal while it is thus rendered more servile becomes also less demonstrative to this cause may be assigned that access ol hypocrisy now more frequently adopted to hide hom society as far as possible all deviations hum though prescribed standard that more rigorous reign of the decencies of life and the growing timidity in authors in their dibits to reproduce the realities which heave and glow beneath these studied appearances the concurrence of all these various influences has occasioned the tendency which we have noticed in fictitious narrative to arrange itself round two opposite poles a pole of lelinenient displayed in frivolities and superficialities in all that is conventional in society  and a pole of cynicism to which the seekers after the intense gravitate in their dibit to excite emotion by the representation ol the exceptional the violent and all that society rejects from its bosom of the animal or the moral man there is also another tendency of civilization most influential on modern literature which must not be omittednamely its disposition to advance though positive at though expense ofthe ideal modern critics have falsely explained this by the prevalence of the much reproached philosophy of though eighteenth century by the scepticism of though metaphysicians and the dovilopeineiit given to the positive sciences by though followers of bacon this philosophy was not au accident but ene among many clleets anding directly out of the intimate nature of man and the

remembered horror as they pass from abuse to abomination recorded in this book but in its own words  no ordinary men leading ordinary lives can form any notion of such a life as this hideous with realistic ghastlinessesnauseous with detail of barbaric torturings scarcely relieved by any touch of tenderness it reiterates a nightmare of iniquities to the end the deportation of convicts to tasmania and elsewhere from these islands has happily ceased the abuses of that obsolete system are contained in minutes and bluebooks of which a tempting array is given at the end of the story it is ostensibly to prevent the extremely improbable return of a similar failure that an extract of all its choicest outrages is here served np as a threevolumed novel it is a work of much power but more horror the hero condemned for a robbery which he did not commit and on which he is heroically silent to conceal his fathers crime and his mothers shame for twenty years suffers unspeakable agonies as a convict is always escaping is always thrown back into a deeper abyss has always some fresh ingenuity of physical or moral torment invented for his benefit then thrown in for divertissement we have a rechauffee of the tichborne conspiracy an incipient adultery floggings to death sundry suicides for very loathing of life and hero and there a climax of cannibalism the story opens with a passion which culminates in the family tragedy and though invective by the way is powerful throughout the defoelike minuteness of the genealogy is surely unnecessary though scenes on board though convictship aro drawn with a strong hand but how is the authors purpose or how is the development of his characters served by his detailed descrip tion of two mutinies  they would have been more at home in some book of hairbreadth stories for boys so too of his homeric single combats and his description of  the bestial boohoo kept up between decks and the hideous phantasmagoria in the evilswelling twilight and the hideous commonwealth whose only order of nobility is the halter all this is very vivid and is held up for our execration and very justly too but after all why kick a dead dog  from the convictship the llydaspes is seen on fire it explodes and in it is supposed to perish richard devine the preconvict name of rufus dawes the hero for such a belief dawes to conceal his sacrifice had created in a letter to his mother he and his bastard halfbrother john rex dawes by the way is a bastard too and does not know of his relationship to rex and frere his cousin an officer are all of course on board the convict ship and all ignorant of each others personality and we find them together again and again still always thrown together as the sufferer and the plotter and the bully after some years of agony at macquarie harboura cheerful place bounded by foetid exhalations and the seaand when the settlement is being moved elsewhere there is another mutiny which is this time successful frere and the wife and daughter of captain vickers and one or two others are landed by the convicts and left to starve but dawes who had previously been exiled to a desert rock for insubordination and had drowned himself once but rescued by an accidental log had wandered away in search of settlements till death had stared him in the facereturning in despair to  hells gates finds the convicts gone but the outcasts starving and he builds them a marvellous coracle of goatskins stretched over logs having caught his goats with springs and salt and what wronder  for  he could fell trees without an axe bake bread without an oven and build a waterproof hut without bricks or mortar and so he becomes their preserver and even the bully frere yields a surly deference to genius and after ten days at sea and of course just as the cruse of oil is on the point of failing they are picked up and frere gives up daws as a runaway and himself usurps the credit of their preservation and mrs vickers dies and on sylvia the child a blank forgetfulness of just that crisis falls and the other two men who might have told had killed each other and so daws is not believed but his last state becomes worse than the first then as the years go round sylvia is married to her supposed preserver frere from gratitude and not for love and ho and she and daws are always being brought fruitlessly into contact and frere is always breaking dawes spirit or someones spirit by fifty or a hundred lashes administered to daws or by dawes with details of weals and groans after the original horror in  uncle toms cabin and so on till the blood boils ten convicts wander off and ultimately eat each other and that for several pages north a drunken parson but a very good fellow appears on the scene as a friend of daws and sylvia but he ends by running off with the latter to sea only that dawes by changing clothes with him forestalls him and so in universal shipwreck the curtain falls meanwhile john rex who had escaped had imposed on the heros mother by his likeness to her son and had lived in splendour till after betraying himself he only survives as an idiot it is a sickening and desolate story all thc crimes of a system are crowded on to the head of one innocent man just as a missionary magazine will concentrate with pentecostal plenty all the concessions effected by the finance of twenty years into a pennyworth plum of touching narrative the plea for the book is that these effete abuses are in fact in course of reconstruction in new caledonia  and no doubt for we have chapter and verse all its horrors are authentic but why send them round in three volumes and in un elegant cover to startle boardingschool young ladies and fire the molluscous imagination of novel readers with auttsdafv on paper and all the tortures of nero  those who sup on horrors know where to go and those who take any useful interest in convicts are more likely to be reached by other means than these the author of his natural life might write a capital book of adventure byfield and flood  or he might acquaint himself with the latest accounts of khiva and tashkend and expand in narrative veracious and vamberesque or he might outboucicault melodramatic tragedy orand herein is another bone to be picked with himlie might write a really good novel of character drawing for his incidents on ordinary life and avoiding the ghastly and the curdling improbabilities  escapes in bluefire down a bottomless precipice unravelable family mysteries a finale only attainable by a universal massacre ti la hamlet are the stock tools of ordinary sensational novelists the author of  his natural life shows us by hints and glimpses that he is capable of better things hia characters though their development is overcrowded with incident contain elements of a power that would well repay practice dawes a brutalised prometheus is simply an incarnation of suffering  but frere the goth who develops by unrestrained exercise of power into the ruthless tyrant and who slowly but surely chokes his springs of good is a character touched in the description by many delicate suggestions he is as it were a teutonic and ruffianly tito his patronising air with the child sylvia and his blank incomprehension of her when she is his wife and his clumsy passion for such unwonted purity are all finely touched sarah parfoy the wife of john rex and mistress of frere is a hard and unwholesome subject but truthfully drawn  she was the sort of girl of whom women say it is a pity she has no mother and men it is a pity she does not get a husband and who say to themselves when shall i have a lover   mr meekin as the apotheosis of a canting parson is perhaps overdrawn  but in the description of north the drunkard there is a vivid power and the crown of the story is sylvia delightful as a queer and irrepressible child and well if far too slightly touched as a loving and unsatisfied woman her childish sayings are many and all good though drawing a little too much on the belief of a reader with average experience of children  will danny wear his yellow jacket in heaven or go as a free man   and it is the one touching trait in the martyr dawes when through all his misery he worships the memory of the child whom he believes to be dead we shall look for another work of the same author either on gorillahunting and maneating or a pleasant and wellelaborated study of character he has it in his power to give us either but we should like to know which it is to be the present story is neither nor

after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy

in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all

nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to

individuals and eau never be melted or welded into one substance out of such reminiscences of a romantic episode in his history mixed up with other curious developments witnessed of late years in new england mr hawthorne constructs his tale he has made a desperate attempt to get ont of the beaten track and let bis fancy rove in the realms of fairyland and in terrestrial spheres not less fantastical yet who ever read anything more real or in fact more thoroughly bostonian the shadow of a temporary phantom there is both soul and substance in the picture blithedale might have been pitched anywhere and might have been the scene of any sort of extravagance on the part of witches fairies angels or devils bnt you feel that you are reading a story of yesterday in which the characters are drawn from life and reflect the sentiments current in the intellectual circles of massachussets the form of the romance is autobiographical which gives fine effect to the pictorial style in which hawthorne has attained a rare degree of excellence his characteristics as a writer and primarily as an observer and thinker are happily hit off by himself in the remarks that come from miles coverdale after zenobia dropped the curtain when he was reconnoitring from the window of his hotel as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed between a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine for was mine a mere vulgar curiosity  zenobia should have known me better than to suppose it she should have been able to appreciate that quality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me often against my will and to the detriment of my own comfort to live in other lives and to endeavourby generous sympathies by delicate intuition by taking note of things too slight for record and by bringing spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom god assigned meto learn the secret which tas hidden even from tltemstlvcs with a faculty so fit for the work thc novelist sketches with an easy graphic and graceful pencil the characters and incidents that figure iu his picturezenobia  the highspirited woman bringing herself against the narrow limitations of her sex priscilla  the weakly maiden whose tremulous nerves endow her with sibylline attributes hollingsworth  the selfconcentrated philanthropist  miles coverdale  the minor poet beginning life with strenuous aspirations which die out with his youthful fervour and as subordinate personages old moodie with his redtipt nose and the patch over his eye shrinking from the glance that might detect in the vestiges of his shattered gentility the records of his former history silas josher the farmoverseer stout and stupid linking medueval barbarism to the millenial blessedness which had begun its reign at blithedale and professor westewelt polished as a dancing master but cool and calculating as the devil with his  veiled lady psychological lectures and supernatural humbug these are the characters and very curious characters they are to begin the millenium with zenobia is queen of the companyand a right queenly woman toowith pride and beauty befitting the name she bore she is a lady of fortune and of high intellectual culturean advocate of the rights of womena transcendentalistan authoress and what not she is the central figure of the story and its interest turns upon her career and destiny which is that of a woman crossed in love drowning herself in a river for in leaving the old world and its ways behind them they went to work much in the old world fashion turning out the usual quantity of comedy and tragedy for of the four chief charactersnamely zenobia and priscilla hollingsworth and coverdalethe first as just stated committed a tragedy the second and third perpetrated a comedy and the fourth did neither the one nor the other but remained a bachelora disappointed one however for he had a few qualms of poetic tenderness toward his sybilline sister though he was hardly conscious of the fact till some years after priscilla had been brought by hollingsworth who had rescued her from some impending danger and to whom the girl clung with a gratitude which ripened into love ere long zenobias affections began to flow in the same direction and the unfortunate man had more love bestowed upon him than he well knew what to do with he was but a rough shaggyhaired blacksmith but with a deep strong heart and a copious supply of magnetic power which threw a spell over the highspirited imperial woman as well as the weak girl isle had a ruling passion in the philanthropic line which was to reform criminals by giving them board and lodging as in our model prisons in a huge penitentiary which he wished to erect and where he could bring them under training proper to fit them for their place in society better have the  scoundrels whipped carlyle would say however this was his schemehis one ideato which he would and did sacrifice truth honour and friendship when they stood in the way of its accomplishment he had come in no good faith to blithedale he did not believe in socialismit was not his ism but like others there he was a disappointed man and in a fit of dejection joined the community carrying his scheme with him and contenting himself with nothing short of appropriating the whole conoern to his own purposes zenobia is won over to bis plan and places her wealth at his disposal some curious revelations however are made in her former history and an unexpected reverse of fortune is at hand the circumstances are too complicated to admit of condensed recital suffice it to say that zenobia and priscilla are discovered to be halfsisters the wealth of the former is transferred to the latter zenobia is deserted and drowns herself in despair hollingsworth prefers the newlydowered priscilla but instead of building his penitentiary is haunted by zenobias ghost and passes his days in remorse and wretchedness from his life is drawn the following moral that admiting what te called philanthropy when adopted as a profession to be often useful by its energetic impulse to society at large it is perilous to the individual whose ruling passion in one exclusive channel it thus becomes it ruins or is fearfully apt to rain the heart the rich juices of which god never meant should be pressed violently out snd distilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process but should render life sweet bland and gently beneficent and insensibly influence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end i see in hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in banyans book of suchfrom the gate of heaven there is a byway to the pit 1 the moral of zenobias career is a legacy from herself committed to the care of coverdale previous to the fatal plunge a moral why thisthat in the battlefield of life the downright stroke that would fall only on a mans steel headpiece is sure to light on a womans heart over which she wears no breastplate and whose wisdom it is therefore to keep out of the conflict or this that the whole universe her own sex and yours aud providence or destiny to boot make common cause against the woman who swerves one hairsbreadth out of the beaten track yes and add for i may aa well own it now that with that one hairsbreadth she goes all astray and never sees the world in its true aspect afterward 1 this is a harsh moral though a fit one for zenobias life this was her experience but we doubt whether it be a fair and faithful picture of reality a lesson so extreme and unqualified appears on the face of it morbid and exaggerated but this is characteristic of hawthorne he is a morbid and moody man who seems to have got out of his proper orbit so as  never to see the world in its true aspect himself he is in his element when dissecting a corpse and smelling putrefaction always he gives you the dark side of humanity and always paints it in such beautiful colours that you are charmed even by what is inexpressibly painful anguish utters no shriek but what is musical and the voice of villainy itself is melodious hawthorne could charm you into admiration of a dunghill he has an eye for the beautiful but only dim perceptions of the right the good and the true your moral faculties are unhealthily excited when excited at all this is a serious defect in a work of so much purity and power and is the source of several artistic faults which would have been remedied by greater moral earnestness in the writer it makes him timid hesitating and slow in his movements with all his originality there is no bold stroke of art but only a succession of beautiful sketches all on the same level and often sprawling and monotonous for want of that concentration of purpose and fullness of design which can only emanate from an earnest and even tumultuous nature with the general effect therefore of this work we are dissatisfied  with most of its scenes and sentiments we are delighted hawthorne is a painter not a sculptor he excels in pictorial colouring not in correct harmony of design notwithstanding the ease with which he now handles his pencil he has reached his present position by slow and laborious effort his latest production is his best and gives promise of something still better in point of mere style he stands at the head of american writers and is one of the few among them who write for immortality as a specimen of his style as well as of millenial life take the following picture of a modern arcadia arcadians though we were our costume bore no resemblance to the beribboned doublets silk breeches and stockings and slippers fastened with artificial roses that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry and the stage in outward show i humbly conceive we looked rather like a gang ot beggars or banditti than either a company of honest labouring men or a conclave of philosophers whatever might be our points of difference we all of os seemed to have come to blithedale with the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing oat our old clothes such garments as had an airing whenever we strode a field i coats with high col1 ara and with no collars broadskirted or swallowtailed and with the waist at every point between the hip and armit j pantaloons of a dozen successive epochs and greatly deaced at the knees by the humiliations of the wearer before his ladylovein short we were a living epitome of defunct fashions and the very raggedest presentment of men who had seen better days it was gentility in tatters often retaining a scholarlike or clerical air you might have taken us for the denizens of grubstreet intent on getting a comfortable livelihood by agricultural labour or coleridges projected pantisocracy in full experiment or candide and his motley associates at work in their cabbagegarden or anything else that was miserably out at elbows and most clumsily patched in the rear we might have been sworn comrades to falstaffs ragged regiment little skill as we boasted in other points of husbandry every mothers son of ns would have served admirably to stick up for a scarecrow and the worst of the matter was that the first ensrgeue movement essential to our downright stroke of real labour was sure to put a finish to these poor habiliments 80 we gradually siting them all aside and took to honest homespun and linseywouey as preferable on the whole to the plan recommended think by virgil nudusara t set nudus which as silas foster remarked when i translated the maxim would be apt to astonish the womenfolks after a reasonable training the yeoman life throve well with us  to be sure our next neighbours pretended to be incredulous as to our real proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand they told slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our new oxen or to drive them afieid when yoked or to release the poor brutes from their conjugal bond at nightfall they had the face to ssy too that the cows laughed at oar awkwardness at milkingtime and invariably kicked over the pails    they further averred that we hoed up whole acres of indian corn and other crops and drew the earth carefully about the weeds and that we raised five hundred tufts of burdock mistaking them for cabbages and that by dint of unskilful planting few of our seeds ever came up at all or if they esme up it was sternforemost finally and as an ultimate catastrophe these mendacious rogues circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated to the last man by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own scythes ana that the world had lost nothing by this little accident the working of their communitarianism and the relation which it sustained to the oldworld system is clearly indicated in some of the incidental occur rences which were brought out now and then as when silas foster asked  which man among you is the best judge of swine or as when he told them  we shall never make any hand at marketgardening unless the women folks will undertake to do all the weeding we havent time enough for that and the regular farmwork reckoning titree of you city folks as worth one common fieldhand no no i tell you we shall have to get up a little too early in the morning to compete with the marketgardeners round boston whereupon follows this reflection it struck me as rather odd that one of the first questions raised after oar separation from the greedy straggling selfseeking world should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the outside barbarians in their own field of labour but to own the truth i very soon became sensible that as regarded society at large we stood in a position of new hostility rather than new brotherhood nor could this fail to be the case in some degree until the bigger and better half of society should range itself on our side constituting so pitiful a minority as now we were inevitably estranged from the rest of mankind

brothers ond sisters levelling all worldly rank the fine ladies and gentlemen awake to the blast of the farmer s horn very early in the morning to go a milking and to labour in the fields till breakfast time the machinery of the community has not been chosen as the groundwork of a lecture for or against communism it simply employed by the way of romauce as a novel and quaint expedient for

seemed to come out of a chest as capacious as a barrel  it weald have served you right if i had iain down and spent the night on the door step just for the sake of putting you to shame but here its guest who will need a warmer and softer bed and stepping back to the wagon in which he had journeyed hither hollingsworth received into his arms and deposited on the doorsteps figure enveloped in a cloak it was evidently a woman  or rather judging from the ease with which he lifted her and the little space which the teemed to fill in his armsa slim and unsubstantial girl as ihe showed some hesitation about entering the door hollingsworth with hil ususl directness and lack of ceremony urged her forward ot merely within the entry but into the warm and stronglylighted kitchen whoii this whispered i remaining behind with him while he wu taking off bis greatcoat who really i dont know answered hollingsworth looking at northeast with some surprise  it is a young person wbo belongs here

seems to welcome her i should hardly judge that sbe was an expected guet  well well said hollingsworth quietly  well make it right the itranger or whatever she was remained standing precisely os that spot of the kitchen floor to which hollingsworth kindly hand had impelled her the cloak falling partly off she was seen to be avery young woman dressed in a poor but decent gown made high in the neck and without any regard to fashion or smartness her brown hair fell down from beneath a hood not in curls but with only a alight wave  her face was of a wan almost sickly hue betokening habitual seclusion from the sun and free atmosphere like a flowershrub that had done its best to blossom in too scanty light to complete the pitiableness of her aspect she shivered either with cold or fear or nervous excitement so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the firelighted wall in short there has seldom been seen so depressed and sad a figure as this young girls  and it was hardly possible to help being angry with her from mere despair of doing anything for her comfort the fantasy occurred to me that be wu some desolate kind of a creature doomed to wander about in snowstorms and that though the ruddiness of our windowpanes bid tempted her into a human dwelling sbe would not remain long enosgh to melt the icicles out of her hair another conjecture likewise came into my mind recollecting hollingsworths sphere of philanthropic action i deemed it possible  he might hare brought one of his guilty patients to be wrought p snd restored to spiritual health by the pure

uameat least not yetif you will be to kind to a forlorn creature priscilla however did not always retain the feeble aspect which characterised heron her first entry into the blithedale farm country air performed its work upon her and the description of priscilla some mouths later may be quoted as a fair specimen of the sterling qualities that characterise mr hawthornes style priscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl and still kept budding and blossoming and daily putting on some new charm which you no sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had previously possessed so unformed vague and without substance as she had come to us it seemed as if we could see nature shaping out a woman before our very eyes and yet had only a more reverential sense of the mystery of a womans soul and frame yesterday her cheek was paletoday it had a bloom priscillas smile like a babys first one was a wondrous novelty her imperfections and shortcomings affected me with a kind of playful pathos which was as absolutely bewitching a sensation as ever i experienced after she had been a month or two at blithedale her animal spirits waxed high and kept her pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment impelling her to far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure she was fond of playing with the other girls out of doors there is hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of young girls almost women grown at play and so giving themselves up to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground girls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys more untamable and regardless of rule and limit with an evershifting variety breaking continually into new modes of fun yet with a harmonious propriety through all their steps their voices appear free as the wind but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible to us young men and boys on the other hand play according to recognised law old traditionary games permitting no caprice of fancy but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts for young or old in play or in earnest man is prone to be a brute especially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race with ber head thrown back her limbs moving more friskily than they need and an air between that of a bird and a young colt but priscillas peculiar charm in a footrace was the weakness and irregularity with which she ran growing up without exercise except to her poor little finger8 she had never yet acquired the perfect use of her legs setting buoyantly forth therefore as if no rival less swift thsn atalanta could compete with her she ran falteringly and often tumbled on the grass such an incident though it seems too slight to think of was a thing to laugh at but which brought the water into ones eyes and lingered in the memory after far greater joys and sorrows were swept out of it as antiquated trash priscillas life as i beheld it was full of trifles that affected me in just this way when she had come to be quite at home among us i used to fancy that priscilla played more pranks and perpetrated more mischief than any other girl in the community for example i once heard silas foster in a very gruff voice threatening to rivet th iee horseshoes round priscillas neck and chain her to a post because she with nome other young people had clambered upon a load of hay and caused it to slide off the cart how she made her peace i never knew but very soon afterwards i saw old silas with his brawny hands round priscillas waist swinging her to and fro and finally depositing her on one of the oxen to take her first lessons in riding she met with terrible mishaps in her efforts to milk a cow she let the poultry into the garden she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in charge sbe broke crockery she dropped our biggest pitcher into the well andexcept with her needle and those little wooden instruments for pursemakingwas as unserviceable a member of society as any young lady in the land there was no other sort of efficiency about her yet everybody was kind to priscilla  everybody loved her and laughed at her to her face and did not laugh behind her back  everybody would have given her half of his last crust or the bigger share of his plumcake these were pretty certain indications that we were all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl and considered her not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle with the world and hollingsworthperhaps because he had been the means of introducing priscilla to her new abodeappeared to consider her his own especial charge there are more characters to the plot the blithedale people now and then visit the town and two people from town now and then visit thema mysterious young professor westervelt with false teeth and a catlike aspect and a certain mysterious  old moodie who is in bis own way not less catlike i take him to be a

bite see now  he means to skulk along that fringe of bushes and approach us on the other side of our clump of maples we soon heard the old mans velvet tread on the grass indicating that he bad arrived

brothers when a critic has been pleased to speak of a work as  the very worst attempt at a novel that has ever been perpetrated we may reasonably expect to find something inordinately bad on the other hand if we discover that we have placed too implicit a confidence in this very excathedra statement we shall not err in visiting an unmerited sentence of condemnation with considerable severity again a production which has been alleged to be little more than a display of bad latin bad french bad german and bad english cannot well be supposed if we pay credit to the words of the selfconstituted judge to come from any other than a grossly illiterate author if however this assertion should be proved to be as groundless as the first it will stand in need of still stronger censure and for this reason  excellence in mere fiction is to a great extent matter of opinion quot homines tot sententice a novel which one critic may pronounce admirable will possibly appear to be little pleasing to another  the imaginative taste is modified and changed by education and association but when the knowledge of the writer has been impugned when he has been charged with grammatical incorrectness pervading several languages  when in fact he is told that not only is his intellect vicious but that he is in ignorance of the proper way of constructing a sentence the matter is altogether changed if what has been affirmed is not true and just then the socalled critic has deserted his peculiar sphere and has condescended to have recourse to rancorous abuse the barrier between criticism and libel may be slender but it must there fore be the more diligently observed those who most strongly uphold the liberty of the press are precisely those who must be most vigilant in seeing that journalism never oversteps its limit the amount of trust accorded to reviews is at the present day immense it is not too much to say that current literary opinion is almost wholly formed by them consequently the injury that is done when organs so powerful for evil or for good are wilfully perverted is simply incalculable  and the more unqualified and positive their unjustly unfavourable judgement may be the more pernicious their effects will certainly prove the novel which has been the subject of the foregoing remarks  the old ledger has met with peculiarly harsh treatment from a contemporary whose name we need hardly mention and that the work is not without faults many of them grave ones we are far from wishing to deny in the first place the j development of the plot and of the characters j is essentially unnatural the heroes and  heroines converse in a manner which is too often artificial melodramatic and forced dr strauss has thus been content to sacrifice one  of the great sources of interestaccurate de j lineation of character in its stead he has j trusted to striking and rather fantastic inci i dents the world which he describes is not j the world of today nor is it that of fifty j years ago  and his actors are such as could surely never have been found among our con j temporaries or our ancestors touches of j nature of course there are to be met with at j intervals throughout the book and sometimes  sufficiently brilliant but the old ledger  j wants the attraction that can only spring j from a carefully elaborated account of j human action and human motives its j brightness is that of the wintery sun utterly j void of genial warmth  it is one of those j fictions which may be read with great interest once but whose second or third perusal will pall upon the mind dr strauss will not plunge sufficiently soon in medias res he keeps his reader standing on the threshold for a long and weary while ere he will permit him to enter the veiled hall he is not allowed to make the acquaintance of sir richard ellesdee without being introduced to his grandfather his greatgrandfather and other personages who have but little interest except for inquirers into family annals and framers of genealogical trees in a similar manner he is not permitted to form his own impression of a house rich in antique curiosities and paintings but is presented with a catalogue in which its contents are enumerated with a conscientious fullness and accuracy worthy of the illustrious robins all this is very fatiguing  and it is rendered even more so by the frequent use which the author makes of italics  than the constant repetition of these nothing can be more wearying to the eye or mind underlined words or expressions are only pardonable in the letters of very young ladies  an author should make it sufficiently obvious where the main emphasis is to fall by the mere construction of his sentences thus we find  then did there not perchancewho shall tell i for who knoweth  c and  an exuberant philanthropy with this awkward qualification that she loved man rather than mankind and men better than man besides a host of other passages equally objectionable the mere english composition of  the old ledger is in the main extremely good  the style is nervous pointed and vigorous occasionally dr strauss is a great deal too diffuse and spends a superfluity of words upon one idea  but his work contains many very striking bits this is good masculine writing  no platform philanthropist henot one of those crosses between sham religion and sham charity the great admired of the hall who head subscription lists with decoy donations and delight in sprinkling their dilute benevolence over some patent vast redhot misery that the hiss may be heard and the steam seen to attract attention to their noble deeds and to their noble selves  but one who would delight in solacing some secret sorrow and effectually relieving some occult individual misery  and who would keep both hands employed in the congenial work that the left might have no leisure to inquire into the doings of the right of the advisability of introducing into a fictitious group of characters real personages who have been disinterred for this express purpose in the manner in which dr strauss avails himself of the usage we are not quite sure however the question is one of no serious importance occasionally quaintnesses are of too constant occurrence   however so is a favourite idiom of the authors again colloquial expressions or expressions which are even still more familiar are too plentiful but of the gramme matical error whatever the language in question may be which has been imputed to the old ledger there is absolutely none many of the scenes are admirably wrought up and the descriptive ability displayed is considerable the outbreak of a fire on board a ship at sea is an old theme but dr strauss has managed it well the picture which he has given of a duel is graphic and contains some of his best touches of character  while throughout the whole of the third volume the interest is various and well sustained it is in his reflections that we like dr strauss the least they are often entirely irrelevant to the theme and digressions unless some colour of an excuse exists are peculiarly objectionable even thought can be stimulated in the reader at too great an expense we dislike also the gossiping tone which is sometimes assumed  and the circuitous method which is occasionally adopted of putting the reader in harmony with the writers sentiments and convictions the old ledger possesses the undoubted merit of containing a large quantity of interesting information which sufficiently proves that the author is not only a man of literary tastes but considerable literary acquirements with reference to this subject we should advise dr strauss to be more careful on all future occasions in the correction of his proofsheets the number of misprints which have been overlooked is quite surprising  while in vol ii page 65 occurs an extraordinary misquotation of a line and ahalf from virgil such that while the sense remains intact the laws of prosody are completely violated defects of this nature are highly culpable through reason of the carelessness which they display  though beyond this they argue nothing  the old ledger  gives evidence of a clever and a thoughtful mind it is exceedingly unequal in point of meritnow brilliant and now heavy at one time we get glimpses of the touch of a master at another we almost see the crudities of a tyro we could also wish more than once that dr strauss had indulged in condemnation a little less roundly and with more reserve it is of course just as well to call a spade by its most simple name  but as novelreaders generally adhere to conventional forms of expression it may be as well to avail oneself of conventional language we have pointed out frankly and plainly what we regard as the chief defects in  the old ledger and we have done so because we feel sure that when its author has amended these he may produce a very admirable work of fiction and one whose popularity will be in proportion to its merit his present production shows great power  nis language is forcible  his imagination is vivid  and his descriptions are full of energy and spirit he has a keen sense of humour and the sketch of dr jolibois the prattler of polyglot is very happy but dr strauss work has other recommendations besides these the moral which it conveys is unexceptionable  the old ledger itself is  a ponderous old book solidly bound in vellum with elaboratelychased heavy solid gold corners and clasps containing an inscription and an avowal of the principles which are to guide successive generations of the house of ellesdee in their banking transactions to this each representative of the family is in turn required to affix his name with a solemn oath that he will obey all the injunctions which are there laid down  that he will allow  no temptation however so luringno danger however so threatening no consideration of self or others however so powerful and urgentto make him swerve from that straight path of honour and integrity it is only when this solemn oath is broken that the fortunes of the eilesdees begin to decline the existence and influence of this timehonoured ancestral volume is well managed and the main events of the narrative are skilfully represented as depending upon the faithful observance of its vows as a whole we are pleased with dr strauss work  and we do not doubt that at some future and we hope not distant time we shall be able to bestow upon him less qualified eulogy,history_contra

the machinery of the minerva press but employed with more skill and a greater regard for probabilities altogether this romance is the best which its author has produced for a long time it will revive

povertystricken but wellborn girl alone in london the case is no uncommon one nor happily is the courageous high spirit to meet it emily foxseton much to her own surprise a marchioness preserves in spite of daily anxieties a natural joyousness and trust which are the basis of her character the author writes with some care for detail and probability yet this very care now and again suggests that all is not taken sur le vif the lady reader who knows what straightened gentility really means may note small discrepancies it is easy to see that comely wholesome emily is a persona gratissima with her author before lord walderhurst comes into her life  to stay the account of how the girl for at thirtyfour she is a girl manages to keep up an appearance bordering on smartness on twenty pounds a year supplemented of course by daily toil is quite a study she makes herself generally useful to and liked by ladies who want their shopping choosing of servants and other things done by proxy all these and other things she does with neatness and dispatch her qualities are not what one expects from the usual heroine of fiction but one grows interested in her works and ways and even her skirts in spite of some unnecessary repetitions the fresh and friendly ways of the  creature as some of her patrons call her appeal to them as they do to us and she is in much request when to her own utter surprise and intense gratitude she becomes lady walderhurst she retains her simple and kindly habits but she does not at once live happily ever afterwards   she is made to undergo many and great dangers we cannot say much in praise of the way this part of her story is unfolded perhaps however the authors numerous admirers will not be hypercritical but will enjoy her story without analysing it  the making of a marchioness dv frances hiodson burnett bs smith elder on the whole the first part of this novel is better than the second in the first you are introduced to emily foxseaton a simple lovable womanly heroine of thirtysix a dependent ladycompanion in great houses who finds an unselfish happiness in promoting the happiness of others and so engaged unconsciously wins the affection of the mature widowed marquis of walderhurst and after a short matteroffact wooing becomes the marchioness the second part is equally good until the marquis has to go abroad then captain osborne heirpresumptive of the marquis who is staying near by with his wife in a house his lordship has lent them is invited to come with his household and become the nlarchionesss guests for a while and under her roof they are better able to carry out diverse diabolical attempts on her life the captains desperation increasing when he learns she is expecting an heir he wants to teach her horseriding intending to arrange a throw for her but she declines aided by his indian servant he deposits a broken cornice on the stairs on the chance of her falling over it saws through the rail of a wooden bridge on which she often leans to watch sunsets poisons her glass of milk but she is saved by her faithful maid and the repentance of the captains wife and fleeing for safety goes into hiding in london the characterisation is so consistently true in the case of emily and the marquis and his cousin lady maria to say nothing of minor persons that one resents the intrusion of this melodramatic captain with his stagey outfit of bluefire villanies and resents it the more because after he has departed to india the story closes with a return to its earlier natural note and the winning of the nmarchioness back from the gates of death is a pathetic and human touch that makes the preceding sensationalism the more unreal withal the book is so eminently interesting that however much you may disbelieve its sensational developments you will not be able to lay it down till you get to the end  notes on novels thfse notes mt the weeks fiction are not necessarilyjinal reviews of a selectin vyill jollow thk ma kim ok a maunnoxkss by frances hodson burnett a pleasant sympathetic story of modern life the scene is laid in an english country house where a marquis is the centre of matrimonial

creature that it took but little to brighten the aspect of life for her and to cause her to break into her goodnatured childlike smile smith elder os  the making of a marchioness by frances hodgson burnett smith elder 6s mks burnett has not done herself justice in this book melodrama is all very well in its own place but out of its placethat is in a novelit demands very special treatment excellent work has been done before now by placing real human characters in melodramatic situations or less often and with greater skill by placing melodramatic characters in real human situations dickens did the former over and over again  mr meredith bus occasionally and very happily done the latter now thc author of thc making vf a marchioness has done neither she has quite frankly placed melodramatic people in melodramatic situations and the result as a novel is not convincing we have a poor hardworking virtuous and rather stupid heroineit is impossible of course in a melodrama to ally virtue with the smallest smattering of brainsand we have a rich handsome virtuous and rather stupid hero who is naturally a marquis and marries the heroine we have come across that taciturn but noble and deeplyfeeling englishman so often that we really begin to think he must exist further as all true melodrama demands we have the villain who would have succeeded to the title if the marquis had not married again and the villains wife who is dark and gipsylike and clenches her thin hands at every opportunity and in the background is the smart lady who says the smart things it is scarcely necessary to mention that the comic relief is maintained in the usual way by the faithful servingmaid and the faithful servingmaids mother every one of these people no doubt exists in a world that is made up of all sorts just as the plots which are laid against the life of the marchioness might with perfect possibility le laid against the life of any real marchioness who is in the way butand this is the pointit is the novelists business to select and mrs burnett has selected neither characters nor incidents fairly the complexity of life which the novelist unlike the playwright has every opportunity of presenting is scarcely suggested in the making of a marchioness and the author gives away her point of view in the sentence  the scene lietween the three was fair too subtle to be of the least use upon the stage but it was a good scene nevertheless now that unwritten scene would probably have done for the book what all the unconvincing incidents in it have failed in doing perhaps it is her descent to melodrama that has made mrs burnett unusually careless of her style  appalling  is a good word but is scarcely applicable to a change of fashion in skirts page 1 honest drops of tears page 270 may be an elizabethan construction but is scarcely justifiable on that account nor do we think even shakespeare would approve of quite so frequent a use of if without the subjunctive

B6030,"['9459915', '9427420']",  belforest a tale of english country life new novels  by the author of mary powell c 2 vols bentley few writers have a better oyo than the author of  mary powell for discerning all that is picturesque in domestic ufo there are no characters perhaps in  belforest that may not be met with in our everyday experienceno incidents that would be considered very extraordinary even in the quiet circles of a country village but the figures are carefully drawn and the grouping is skilfully managed so that every portion of the picture is effective although it is composed of homely materials the author has evidently bestowed a good deal of thought on artistic subjects and she carries out with her pen the principles that she would recommend to those who work with the brush and palette her first rule we should imagine is to go to nature for models her second to select from among natural objects those which are pleasing and reject those which are rough and coarse her third to make an harmonious arrangement of the various tints and to throw a genial warmth over the whole there are many other kinds of art besides this but this is by no means a bad kind moreover it is essentially womanly and ladylike womanly because it is gentle and unassuming and does not aspire to heroics and ladylike because it is always refined and disdains to borrow  humours from the stable and pothouse the scene of  belforest is laid in a retired village untainted with suburban innovations but near enough to london to be within a walk of the dulwich gallery here wo find a young artist leonard antony lodging at the village postoffice and sketching everything in the neighbourhood whether living or inanimate nessy saffery the postmasters little daughterwho is esteemed a young lady of property on the strength of possessing an annuity of thirty poundsaspires to be initiated into the mysteries of art and it is ludicrous to contemplate the horror of the london zeuxis when asked to give lessons to the child of a village grocer nor is it less amusing to behold the blank dismay of miss saffery when leonard antony persuaded at last to undertake the charge sets her to draw straight lines on a piece of inillbuard though pour child has been fondly imagining that she is to start with a grund subject and a bright glow of colouring that she is to commence at once on a glorious work of art such as that on which mr antony himself is engaged the sudden fall to something little better than pothooks is terrible and nessys irrepressible anger nearly creates a fatal breach between the singular allies this quarrel between the clever and sarcastic young man and the demure little girl of thirteen makes a very amusing scene and it ends in a compromisemiss saffery being permitted to handle the brush a little while she graciously consents to use the chalk and millboard a good deal in avery short time she makes rapid progress the village magnates purchase her rustic sketches and even her instructor nods approval from his lofty pedestal however she is not intended to be a painterat least not in the present work perhaps the author intends to give us a continuation as nessy is not yet married or even in love and there are one or two other threads that might be taken up but  belforest has its own share of the romance of life apart from nessy several

the orangecoloured starfish which clinging to the rocks beneath dotted ait intervals the distant bottom in one or two plaices the wild and stunted shrubs grew down close to the waterline and thc shadows of a couple of young ash trees were seen playing on its sparkling surface the passage across was by a very slippery causeway not more than a foot broad at the widest and formed by thc edges of

indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to

the story opens iu the very best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words

attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it

edwards sir richard burtons selection from the baitalpachisi is one of the strangest of fairy story books this old legend contained the germ of the  arabian nights and suggested both matter and form to such later collections of tales as the  decameron and apuleius  golden ass fantastic all of them gruesome many of them full of strange witty inventions their very grotesqueness fascinates while their applicability to modem times fills one with wondering mr grisets illustrations are altogether in keeping with the text sir richard burton translated freely he acknowledges  to remedy the conciseness of their language and certainly he gave them an attractive form  vikram and the vampire or tales of hindu devilry  adapted by richard f burton frgs c london  longmans green and co 1870 christmas is the time to welcome old friends with new faces but it is a question whether mr burtons adaptation of the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a vampire which first appeared in fraser should not rather be described as an attempt not altogether welladvised to pour the new wine of western criticism and humour into the old bottle of oriental invention w7ith the exception of a few modern and altogether foolish jokes such as  i love my love with an s because hes stupid and not psychological which do not harmonise with the ingenious paraphrases of hindu eloquence the book is decidedly amusing there are no weird horrors like those in the story of grettir and glam and the vampire himself is a goodtempered and rather engaging demon who executes the will of fate by slipping through raja vikrams fingers and having to be recaptured every time the raja is seduced into giving an opinion on the merits of one of the true stories which he relates in succession these are of varying interest and complexity the worst being the only one literally translated  but in the others it is easy to distinguish by internal evidence the modern gloss from the original framework of the tale the episode of the apple of life in the introduction is one of those which found their way from oriental collections into the gesta romanortttn and the vampires third story contains the rudiments of the favourite german character der getreue johannes the fifth story which recalls portions of the forty thieves suffers from the editors attempt to give the modern equivalent for the lingo of the hindu scripture chanriyavidya or thieves manual the best illustration belongs to the seventh story and represents a quadrupedfrankenstein a supernatural tiger destroying the wagners who created him  but it is one of the incongruities of style before complained of to make the guru  a physiologicophilosophicopsychologicomaterialist a jayasthalian who had become convinced  that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself the problem which finally poses king vikram is to find the relationship between the children of a father and son who have married a daughter and mother but this is introduced by a pseudoprophetic description of the white outcasts who will one day conquer india which is not much better than is common to this hackneyed form of satire the chief use of the volume besides dispelling unpleasant associations with the name of vampire will be to familiarise the run of readers with hindu methods of thought and expression and to show the tie of aryan brotherhood strong through all superficial discrepancies m octave feuillet could not improve upon  no one knows the ways of woman  she kills her husband and becomes a sati suttee

taits of hindu de vii ry adapted by richard f burton with illustrations longmans  co it is somewhat strange that the indian tales entitled  the twentyfive stories of baital and the thirtytwo stories of the throne have not become better known in europe the baital pacbisi and singhasan battlsf such are their indian names are household words in hindustan they truly reflect the customs and superstitions of the hindus and they contain some poetical touches and a great deal of capital horror of the monk lewis and der freischutz school sometimes there is an approach to pathos as in the story of the rajput family who devoted themselves for raja rupsen their chief excellence however is in the description of lonely cemeteries and incantationscenes which latter are quite equal to that where the wild huntsman of the hartz mountains makes his appearance capt burton therefore has a theme of some promise in its peculiar way and he is the man to make the most of it but it is time to explain the meaning of baital pachii vetiilab in sanskrit is a sprite or goblin haunting cemeteries and inhabiting dead bodies in hindi the word is baital such a being is the narrator of the twentyfive tales which have become one of the popular storybooks of india and the way he is brought on the stage is as follows  the father of vikram king of ujjain a city in central india has incurred the resentment of one of those hindu saints who seem never to be aroused from their heavenly meditations except to deliver an anathema on their fellow men gandharbasena vikrams father is cursed by the saint and dies and the saint then plots the destruction of vikram he is the more confirmed in his design as it so happens that vikram who is the indian king arthur was born at the same astrological period as the saint as was a third individual the son of an oilman who in some way we are not told how but probably by penance obtains though sovereignty of the infernal regions and fate has decreed that whichever of the three can murder the other two will become a universal monarch the saint who by the by is the son of a potter murders the oilman and suspends his corpse in a cemetery head downwards from a tree where it becomes the abode of a baital or demon the saint then comes to vikram in the shape of a handsome young merchant presents the king with rubies of inestimable value and asks him to attend a sacrifice which he is about to make to durga the goddess of carnage intending when vikram prostrates himself before the goddess to strike off his head vikram however has been warned of the treacherous design by a giant whom he had defeated in single combat he goes to the sacrifice with his son and is told by the ascetic to bring the oilmans corpse from the cemetery where it hangs in spite of horrible apparitions which are sent to deter him vikram cuts down the corpse when the demon who inhabits it tells him he will consent to go with him only on condition of his not speaking he then tells the king as he is carrying him twentyfive tales and at the end of each puts a question so artfully that vikram is twentyfour times betrayed into answering whereupon the corpse slips from his grasp and resumes its hanging posture in the tree at last when the twentyfifth story is told vikram maintains silence and the demon now instructs him when he is commanded by the saint to prostrate himself to request his holiness to show him how to do so and to strike off the head of the ascetic as soon as he bends baitiil then departs from the corpse which vikram carries to the saint whom he decapitates as directed capt burton has selected the first second third fourth sixth ninth tenth thirteenth fourteenth twentyfirst and twentyfifth stories and of these he has translated the tenth literally and the rest freely his eighth story which corresponds to the twentyfirst of the hindi is largely supplemented and there is among the insertions an excellent account of hindu philosophy capt burton makes no mention in his preface of a former translation of the  baital pachisi by mr burckhard barker which was edited by mr eastwick in 1855 we will only further observe with regard to the note at page 36 that persia is one of the countries in which a hog is stabled with horses to avert calamity from them at page 41 we suppose witches should be read for bears as da in is

considered by some of her friends that such change might be more easily and safely accomplished  if a clear knowledge of the operation of the present system on all the parties concerned were more general than it is found to be and it was at their instigation that she was induced to give her aid towards the advancement of that object by means of the instrument which he had before wielded so effectivelydidactic fiction hence the idea of the series of tales the first volume of which now lies before us miu martineam has selected three epochs of our history for her illustrations of the game lawe and their practical effect upon the population among whom they prevail this first volume is devoted to the old forest laws of canute and those still more stringent enacted by the norman kings and which endured until swept away by the torrent of public indignation in the revolution of 1640 the forthcoming volumes are to illustrate the operation of the milder system that prevailed from the revolution of 1688 to the change of the law in 1831  and an exposition of the working of the existing svstem as it affects all the parties related to it the first tale is entitled ii nmerdhin and is intended to show the nature and operation of the forest law forced upon the saxons by their danish conquerors the second named  the manor and the eyrie is laid in the times of the early norman kings the third  the staunch and their work descending somewhat later exhibits the ultimate effects of those harsh laws upon the happiness of the people and the fourth which closes the volume and is entited  old land marks and old laws traces the still more remote consequences to the point where endurance had been carried to the utmost and humanity was about to rise in rebellion against intolerable oppression as a literary production independently of their political purposes these tales are in all respects worthy of the past fame of the authoress like her other works of the same class they have an interest as fictions perfectly apart from the lessons they are designed to teach indeed so excellent are the nar ratives that we are apt to forget the moral intended to be taught in the absorbing attraction of the story whether the reader will draw for himself the conclusions designed to be impressed upon him is a problem that might admit of doubt but there will be no question as to the great ability with which miss martineau has accomplished her task nor that this new series of didactic fictions will command a popularity scarcely less than that enjoyed by its predecessors whatever the readers individual opinions upon the subject to which they are devoted he cannot fail to reap both instruction and amusement from the perusal of these forest and game law tales which may be safely

calling this decidedly the very best romance that mr james has produced the mystery and the interest are alike well sustained and the principal character delineated with a degree of dramatic power that i marks those happier creations of the author which stand out from the common run of fictitious heroes albert maurice the young burgher is a noble conception well filled up and in good keeping with the time when the demarcations of society were so broadly drawn and yet oftentimes so suddenly reversed the period too is one of much attraction the low countries have been our european nurseries of commerce and liberty they were the first to break up the foundations of that great feudal system which growing at first out of the necessity for protection which the distracted state of kuroio made necessary in the turbulence of its early darkness became afterwards so intolerably oppressive when peace had its claim as well as war trade brought wealth which was power and brought still morea habit of enterprise men saw the necessity of protection for their gains  hence arose certain rights and privileges wrung first from the weakness of some ruler who looked not beyond the present often revoked and often infringed yet the precedent once established became an authority for war freedom soon took a more extended view and out of those civic immunities and commercial protections grew those ideas of mans unalienable rights now so well understood and so generally insisted upon these volumes present a most animated picture of the period with its tumults and troubles its forests swarming with freebooters its nobles still looking upon themselves as earths savon red ones its burghers growing every day mure conscious of their importance  and the one or two of highertoned minds who inspired by patriotism planned more important schemes for the benefit of their own native lands and towns such are the materials which have been wrought out with animation worthy of those stirring days while the repose of so sweet and gentle a being as mary of burgundy is in excellent relief to the darker shadows of the picture the ensuing passages may show with what grace the embellishments are thrown in wc

the colder realities of the stern world we dwell in the mind of albert maurice had been excited by the scenes lie hat just gone through  and success without making him nrrogant had filled him full of hope mach step that he took forward seemed but to raise him higher and each effort of an enemy to crush him seemed without any exertion of his own but to clear the way before him such thoughts were mingling with other feelings  brought forth by the sight and the roice and the smile of mary of burgundy when the sudden call to her presence woke him from ouch dreams but woke him only to show to his minds eye a thousand confused but bright and splendid images as gay as glittering as pageantlike but as unreal also as the airy vision which hangs in the morning light over the sicilian seas fancy at once called up every thing within thu wide range of possibility battles and victories and triumphant success the shout of nations and of worlds the sceptre the palace and the throne with a thousand indistinct ideas of mighty things danced before his eyes for a moment with a sweeter and brighter image too as the object and end of ambition the reward of mighty endeavour the crowning hoon of infinite success but still he felt and knew even while he dreamed that it was all unreal and as he followed the messenger with a puck pace though vision faded and left him but the cold and naked truth

oppression of some human eye watching the emotions of the mind as they act upon the body and keeping sentinel over the hearts index  the face mary of burgundy was not alone though as much alone as

martin from the fact of a few lingering bright days of sunshiny sweetness breaking in upon the autumn as a memorial of the warmer season gone before the sky was full of light and the air full of heat and the grand masses of high grey clouds that occasionally floated over the sun were hailed gladly for their soft cool shadow although the day was the eleventh of november sweeping over the prospect like the mighty but indistinct images of great things and splendid purposes that sometimes cross a powerful but imaginative mind the shadows of thc clouds moved slow over hill aud dale field and

very ambitiousas every novel must be ambitious which pretends to embrace the whole life of a man from the cradle to the grave the fault of the voice of the people is that it is too long we do not mean that its length is excessive in any absolute sense nor that the author digresses unduly from the theme which she has set herself nor do we mean that the book is dull it never is dull we mean that much of it is unimportant and inessential in the pretty and diverting scenes of white and black life at sleepy kingsborough the home of nick burr that born lawyer and politician and state governor this triviality of observation is especially felt it has a weakening effect on the story as a whole the original projective force of an author is strictly limited by nature and if the author tries to spread that force over too large an area the result must be in a measure to render it futile miss glasgows faculty of observation needs discipline it is too busy too fussy and a great deal too fancifulfanciful where it should be imaginative she often does not observe the right kind of thing she trifles and gives rein to mere fancy and gradually she passes into a condition a mood which without conscious intent twists and contorts life into something untruthfully erettysomething emasculate and feebly emotional when er hero and heroine approach the passionate climax of their lives

boy who from nothing reaches a position of importance in his native state the hopes despairs successes and failures and other vicissitudes that meet him on his path are described with some vividness but there is more than this to attract the reader and more especially those with a liking for tales of the southern american states these latter are a happy hunting ground for clever novelists across the atlantic since  the open question and a book by mrs burnett we do not remember any story with so fine a southern setting and background for character as this where it is not plot and incident it is a series of bright soft pictures of nature itself of luxuriant gardens and of people instinct with droll or lovable peculiarities the life of the old virginian landowners the negro servants their

also admirable so is the household of judge bassett and so in another way are the hardworking family of the ambitious poorwhite  hero the farmstead and the harsh yet kind stepmother and her chronic neuralgy all these persons places and things are excellent because beneath the impressionist touch of miss glasgow there is a solid hold on average human nature we perceive this in many matters in the relations between the general and his daughter and in a sense of an underlying unforced pathos in passing people and inanimate objects around them the group of happy irresponsible children is charmingly drawn then there are the sayings and doings of the black people often comical to a high degree indeed uncle ish his dignified almost injured attitude towards the kind human ravens who

nature and while here she dwells by preference among the more amiable specimens of it she does not shirk sterner realities indeed the story of her central character is so full of pain that we somewhat

too placidly in the end among these comfortable charming folks the personality and career of nicholas have an added pathos the hardused struggler with the strong will the clear brain the inexorable

than the writer befire us whether  author of the subaltern or rev g 31 gleig libentius audit he has no taste for any thing but sketches either because he has no patience for details or no tact for discussing perplexities or no confidence of powers for making them attractive and therefore wisely shuns the attempt he observes closely and what he observes he paints distinctlyperhaps too distinctlywith too hard an outline he has the art of giving more intensity to small matters than fairly belongs to them and thus occasionally raises a sort of factitious interest which rather excites for the moment than satisfies on reflection there is no possibility of blending poverty and sentiment dirt and delicacy misery and fastidiousness to any useful purpose mr g sighs over fine feelings where they are not likely to exist the country curate consists of nine or ten sketches three of which are reprinted from blackwoods clever and amusing miscellanythey embrace the curates own story and some extraordinary facts which fall under his own eye during his official ministrations the curates tale is a melancholy onean early death precipitated by the ruin of the fond hopes of felicity with a lovely girl herself the victim of hope deferred operating upon a consumptive constitution the sketches also are all of the graver cast and tell of misfortunes the results of oppressions or indiscretions or unbridled passionsof course not equally fitted for commanding the feelings of sympathy though with one exception this is obviously the authors purpose all of them have an air of life and reality about them the tale of the poacher particularly so his hut upon the mloor and the scenery around are described some will say with the pencil of an artist and others not unjustly with the pen of a surveyor it is too minute miss mitford would have produced an equal effect with half the words the poaclhers case is no common one and is with few exceptions matter of fact and it had need be from the gravity of the tone which the author takes in relating it he is not prompted to poaching by idleness but driven by necessityto feed his familly he is no dealer in game he shoots and snares upon principlehares and partridges have no definable owners and he seizes them as the fox does because he wants them the old man had been expelled from a small farm rented by his ancestors for a century or more and subsequent sickness and distress compelled him to apply fir parochial relief this was harshly refused by the skinflint and unsympathizing farmers and returning in a state of excitement to his desolate hut he found hares feeding upon his cabbageswhy should he not feed upon them  he followed the natural dictate of necessityand further necessity forced him to persevere and yet while these facts are dropping from the authors pen he oddly ascribes the old mans poaching pursuits to an innate propensitya thing of principle the old man was ready to work but work was not always to be had while his children were always to be fed his poaching became frequent and work became scarcer and thus the habit wvas confirmed the curate expostulates in vain the old man had reasoned himselfno ifficult matter perhapsinto the rectitude of the act in all other respects he was proverbially honest and the worthy curate in spite of prevailing prejudices gave him what employ he could unluckily the son shared in the odium of his father and took of necessity to the same courses which quickly terminated fatally the youth was shot in a struggle with gamekeepersan event which plunged the ol0 man into stupor and accelerated his death the tale itself is not it will be seen very attractive but the tone of earnestness with which it is told fixes irresistibly the readers attention the writer expresses his indignation at the system of grasping economy which threw the small farms into great ones to this cause he assigns justly much of the misery existing among the agricultural labourers  but with this he couples anotherour mischievous poor laws this we take it is a species of cant picked up from the fashionable economists but which will surely soon vanish that the poor laws are in numerous instances injudiciously administered no man can doubt but that the principle is badthat they create their own objects is we verily believe a mere phrase apparently smart and adapted and remembered chiefly for that reason can the author see no causes for l misery among the poor but idleness and a l disposition to lean upon the poor rates  does he not mark how the rates have grown with the taxes  does lie not mark the effect of excise upon the prices of the necessaries of life  dloes he not mark the practice of the farmers of flinging the labourers upon the rates

the same time the story has no lack of felicities it errs merely upon the side of over elaboration a redundance of analytic pains bestowed upon not quite worthy material mr crackanthorpe has hardly told his oemmunia in this instance proprie his dramatic and pictorial power is overcome by his expository so that the story does not quicken and kindle into life at any point despite the fact that its every page is of a certain interest the two o owing stories attain complete success partly because they do not deal with characters and situations wholly c ommon place but possessing a spice of that

this is a singular book alike in its excellences and defects mr crackan thorpe has three great capacities he is excellent in psychological analysis in pictorial description and in dramatic narrative his danger would seem to lie in the temptation to let the analysis and the description run riot in his longer work he has not yet attained to that sure sense of proportion whicheveninferiorfrenchwriters so often possess prolonged and minute refinement of analysis is justified only by some action upon the part of the character so analysed upon which the analysis sheds light and which really requires such illumination obviously every human action may be analysed endlessly a mans reasons for writing a letter taking a walk going to the play or for not doing so are far from simple though he be unconscious of it altogether and there is a fascination in tracking act back to their original motives but art demands that the good of the whole be considered and not the immediate brilliance of one part and in mr craokanthorpes book there are long passages of quite singular brilliance which we could wish away no doubt  sentimental studies by their very title promise and require a certain degree of deliberate analysis but not to the extent of devoting to it whole sections in which the action the positive play of sentiment stands still while the author makes subtle and careful investigation into his creatures springs of conduct it is this habit which denied dramatic success to browning and arnold felt that his  empedocles  was no true drama because in it nothing was done when on the contrary mr crackanthorpes subtlety and carefulness of psychology are mixed with action and expressed throuh gesture or speech and their interpretation he is perfectly and powerfully dramatic as in the last pages of his in cumberland the seemingly stray and inconsequent thought of one in meditation the significance of details in manner or surroundings the part played in human drama by inanimate things the sensible ways in which emotion finds outlet often grotesque or crudeall this is rendered with a keen fidelity and intelligence by mr crackanthorpe he rarely mentions things concrete and definite without succesul effect nor fails to make clear their relations to the sentiment of his actors as yet he has well handled only situations of some vivid directness and characters of some strong individuality the more com plex and leds dramatic scenes and interests are still somewhat tentatively treated he is assuredly a master of the short story who writes in vigorous and distinguished style with mannerisms never distressing if sometimes a little trying the harmony and rhythm of the long story the elaborate novel or romance have not yet come to him he has much of the insight that can conceive but not the power that can create an emma bovary or a maggie tulliver the elements that go to the making of great creations are discernible in his present work but they are not in proper fusion proportion combination yet surely few fst books are so rich in rare excellencies the dramatic instinct the instinct of selection the grasp of character it is strong

effected byandbye john once more turned his thoughts towards matrimony for himself  that john butly should feel disposed to marry again does not seem so extraordinary john had married youngwas a young fatherand as he truly said the relative ages of himself and helen had in some degree alleviated the grief which he felt for the loss of her mother by placing her in the position of mistress of his

various merits in order to awaken their attention to the present which will tend firmly in its own unsupported strength indeed we recollect none of mrs brays tales of fiction in which the variety of her powers is more strongly exhibited than in the volumes before us in all matter connected with antiquityin the description of the dress habits manners of earlier ages and of the days of our forefathers she is almost without a rival several such pictures might be selected if we had room from the present pages the accuracy of which would be unimpeached by the antiquary and their force and effect acknowledged by the reader of taste there is also a playfulness of fancy and much quaint and pleasant humour seen in the sketches of patch and especially of grace belt and of sir simon the curate the leading characters aredrawn with precision and force while the narrative is relieved by contrasts and by description alternating with action perhaps a little more incident in the early part of the work might be expected  but there is also a defect in too crowded a narrative which mrs bray has avoided and we should have been sorry to have lost the pages of descriptive lorethe portraits of the abbot and the archdeaconthe feasts in the refectorythe ordeal of the cellarer and all the other sketches of monastic life the story was suggested by a legend attached to the ruins of the castle of berry pomeroy near totness in devonshire  a castle founded by one of the friends and followers of william the conqueror and subsequently bestowed by henry the seventh on sir piers edgcombe the impressive event that belonged to the history of the castle in the times of richard the first was communicated to mrs bray by a little maiden of the name of mary chaff another tradition regarding the same sir henry de pomeroy is preserved in cornwall in the neighbourhood of st michaels mount and by a union of the two mrs bray has composed the fabric of her interesting story the chief characters introduced are baldwin the abbot of tavistock sir henry de pomeroy sir simon the curate lady alicia de beaumont the mistress of welsworthy castle lady adela de marmontier her ward walter the palmer grace belt the millers daughter caedmon the saxon page and patch the fool as regards the story itself we do not think it quite fair to the author to communicate it in our pages to the public when they can read it so much better in hers  and shall only say that though at its commencement it moves perhaps rather more slowly than we could wish yet during its progress it speedily increases in interest in variety of circumstance development of character and rapid changes of adventure the first incident of consequence is the appearance of henry de pomeroy in the monastery of tavistock as a friend of john earl of montaigne afterwards king john in his way to raise levies in devonshire aud cornwall to enable john to seize the sceptre then apparently hanging loose in the hands of the absent and imprisoned richard the abbot is of the same party  but being a man of the world had mixed ap a few private affairs with the public good and had recommended his friend at once to enrich himself and strengthen his party by laying siege not to king richards castles but to a pretty little tenement called the fair adela to which a good deal of land was attached in normandy and england when henry de pomeroy gained this desirable prize the abbot for his assistance was to have a mitre and defy the bishop while this very moral and disinterested scheme was concocting a person called walter the palmer arrives at the monasterya silent and severe man doing penance for his sins but as to what took place the night after his arrivalhis midnight visit to pomeroythe history of the silver spearthe penitential vow at the shrine of st michaelthe awful warnings regarding adelathe denunciations of misery attending pomeroys alliance with her these things are not to be revealed to the uninitiated by us in our slight and careless pages but to be well pondered in the original volume the first part of which here closes the second volume introduces us to the castle and presence of lady alicia de beaumont which is described at once with picturesque force and scientific detailto a hunting match by the abbots hounds on lady alicias domain which is narrated with great spirit and truth and which introduces us to a new character geoffrey de malduit a rejected suitor of the lady adela sir henrys attachment gains fresh strength in spite of the palmer aad his warnings very rapidly and lady

think that the stirring interest commences henry pomeroys suit is rejected by lady aliciaadela is doomed to take the veiltremendous hints are given of the danger of an alliance between the lovers an interview in one of the chapels of the abbey church takes place between lady alicia and the palmer of the most awful nature and a fearful confession to abbot baldwin is the result and the immediate

more remote districts and it contains also very striking delineations of the wild and romantic scenery of this remarkable conntrv we eannot say that the mode of life and state of manners described in

B467,['4414706'],  the queen of denmark ltrature tun queen of denmark possesses more remarkable claims upon th bwtish public than its title intimates it is a novel of the historic isool 1 theer best

matilda sister of george iii the distinguishd editjustly remarlk that xafteti is the charac teristic of the author which attaches strong inferences to its parentas being andersenian be that as it may there is certainly a simplicity in the style and sentiments of the author which is peculiarly captivating and lends an inexpressible charm to his narrative and sketches of ch rader the hearty and lifelike introduction to sophus the chamberlain of other times  who having outlived his contemporary world wanders about its ruins like scipio in carthageonly that ulike sci pio he wear a gold embroidered pelisse and a tail which is daily tied afsh with a new black bow as a mark of antirevolutionary independence or to add an occasional pointed commentary to the words of the speakergives the reader at once an idea of the equally genuine and lifelike sketches which are made to emanate from such a source and which are narrated with such unaffected spirit and such a delicate sense of tasteful simplicity that as mrs gore truly remarks instead of feeling ourselves to b perusing a novel or even a romantic series of historical memoirs we could fancy itlhe queen of denmark to be the mere journal of some obsvant courtiercircumstantial as dangeau and artless as pepys caroline matilda although her character is carefully s etc  is not however the polar star of the tale that position is occupied by the pretty and good lisette the supposed goldsmiths daughter and to whom among all the various scenes and scattered groups amid which she is made to move the interest still ever reverts as greater as well as minor stars alike revolve around their arctic contemporary for the same reason although interested in sophus we can never pardon his heartlessnessexcept in that scarcely indeed a true specimen of pagefor with all his faults he is still virtuous but his boys love of elizabeth changed for a manly admiration of lisette to again revert after an inexcusable wavering caused by elizabeths limp and even the union of the lovers brought about by lisettes selfsacrificing goodness give no interest to the usual matrimonial climax that can for a moment compare with what we experience in the heartsevered exiled and melancholy fortunes of the fair isette herself the plot which hurries the english princess and danish queen into dis grace is the only portion of the s memoirs so to call them that is not made sufficiently clear and the catastrophe itself is most unexpectedly brought about it is evident that the author has been guided in thus restraining himself within the close limits of a pleasing instead of indulgthe queen of denmark an historical novel edited by mm go 3 vol henry colburn ing in a scandalous narrative by the same delicate sense of propriety ch confers so simple and yet elective a charm upon the love scenes in the goliths houe held despite of the querulous and duennalike aunt these are just the points which the modern novel school would not for the most part have treated with the same forbearance and while it reflects credit upon the young literature of denmark so it also impresses us with a very high opinon of the public taste which demands so much refinement in its works of fiction the same just sense of the beautiful in forbearance is not only manifested in its most trying field but also on all other topics take for example the chamberlains idea of wit  it was not a witticism for wit should be free from malice or the old courtiers elaborate exposition of bon ton and again  nature and truth are ever certain to make their fortune at court like all rarities but be it observed only when they present themselves in a noble form  or in another place reality differs from fiction in this respect that in the former we cannot always see the leading thread whereas in the latter we must constantly be able to follow it and perceive the necessary concatenation but this last quotation is rather an example of a just than of a merely delicate sense of what is due to the historical novel which combines both reality and fiction at the same time there are some oversights in the translation as in the masquerade one where intruders are on several different occasions called  smugglers and old calais is spokeii of as being sadly mauled a word which is not at all adapted to represent the danes appropriate expression but apart from such trifles the 1 queen of denmark is essentially a family novel calculated to please by its style to purify by its good taste and to instruct by its lifelike sketches of danish life manners and feelings both in humble life and at court as it was in olden time the author has not written in haste nor till he was thoroughly master of his subject and he has consequently placed himself by this novel in a situation of modest rivalry with the best productions ofthe kind of which european literature can boast,history_contra

the narrative by unfolding the plot we will confine ourselves to remarking that as in mr reades last work he selected a couple of social subjects for the foundation of a matteroffact romance wherein he illustrated the maxim that it is never too late to mend so now has he chosen a social subject erne that may be said to have been popular in the sense of its being commonly discussed rather than of having found general favour and therein he professes to show in a certainly novel way that  the course of true love never did run smooth the author winds up his story by criticising it lads and lasses

B881,"['6779796', '9408958']",  fiction the two standards by william barry t fisher unwin 6s we have read few recent books so full of specifically modern interests as this it is a storehouse of observations and trenchant criticisms a museum of latterday types and an inventory if we may use the word of clamorous problems to say this is not necessarily to praise the book as fiction and indeed its faults on this score must be apparent to the most casual reader dr barry whom we have known as a distinguished quarterly reviewer and as the author of the new antigone has given us rather the material for art to work upon than the finished product his point of view is far more the moralists than the artists his sense of the emotional ct mes of modern life is so keen that the dramatic is apt to merge in the rhetorical and the novelist to become a mere recorder the book is very rich in the rootqualities of literature but the multiplicity of problems has baffled the author and he has sacrificed form to fulness and renounced the selecting and pruning which is the life of art such seems to be the main fictional weakness of the work  its merits conspicuous as they are belong more properly to another sphere the title is taken from one of the exercises of st ignatius the famous parable which is the christian counterpart of the choice of herakles the problem is as old as the worldthe choice between the pleasing evil and the bitter good at first everything is obscure other tests predominate and the great moral distinction has not emerged the purpose of the book is to trace the progress from indeterminate ease to the crisis which arrives soon or late for every man when the standard of right and wrong reveals itself as solitary and final but this is a mere general description in detail the problem presents itself in a thousand forms from first to last the history of marian greystokes life is a tissue of problemsfrom the schwdrmerisch girls longing for the great world to the final renunciation of the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the antagonism between a harsh evangelical creed and poor human nature between commercialism and art between love and duty between the tinsel and the gold in characterall are presented with great clarity and truth it is this which makes the book complex and episodic there are scores of wheels within wheels dramas in the jeschylean manner within dramas the author demands a solution of each problem which arises with a moralists insistence and he presents each side fairly with more than a moralists candour the work is significant in a dozen waysas an essay in modern realism which demands adequacy in detail as a tale of unrest which forbids a facile completeness and maybe as a revolt in the manner of aylwin against a dapper and artificially perfect construction the writing is in the grand mannervery rich coloured and melodious we think it less successful in the elaborate descriptions of the production of elvens two great musical dramas than in more simple efforts the author writes of nature with a happy inspiration a calm clear day with slowly fading colours warm in the west tinging the whole sky with faintish purple as of henna darkening the fingertips themselves rosy or take this of german prose i dont feel sure that we have any prose goethe is a mellow pipe playing soft pastorals dear as that blue sky and almost as passionless werther was a tropical spring soon past lessing blows great martial musio out of bronzeclassic bronse he borrowed from the romans and is beyond imitation then there

can call our own sometimes the words have a sting mr randall stafford who belonged to that preestabhahed harmony which fits the wellborn for places of large emolument or again heroism never died out nay there was an enthusiasm of darkness as well as of light the modern man sometimes a recluse in his ivory tower dedicated to literature art metaphysics or selfindulgence was often effeminate but always given up to impulse    modern books reeked with a sadnoss too dreadful to be quite human behind their frivolous or desperate language the terrible shadow lurked for the veil of things did not hide vacancy but powers conscious neverdying between whom a warfare went on always most embittered in the heart of man but the finer things in the book defy quotation such are the account of the horror of harlands madness in prison the whole little idyll of  rosa munda and the extraordinary chapter called  mater saeva cupidinum now and then we feel a touch of the rhetorical the overstrained or the merely sentimental the plan of the book as we have said is faulty there is a little too much parade of erudition and now and then a tendency to the dithyrambic spoils the dignity of style but apart from such failings it is a strong and moving piece of work full of knowledge and delicacy a real transcript of life some time ago the study in modernity was sickly nervose or at the best crudely propagandist it is the merit of dr barrys book that it is a transcript sober and critical with no moral save the old cosmic doctrine of right and wrong his own words furnish the most succinct summary of the tale two livesand the struggle for victorywhichever won the issue is tragic impulse and law and the martyrs of each the worldmovement passing through their hearts a romance but also unalloyed reality  the ttco standards nbw novels by william barry fisher unwin the author of  though new antigone has written another striking book with resolute condensation it might even have been a considerable novel  but the author by his own confession is to some extent dependent on his creatures and fails not from defect but abundancethe embarrassment of riches besides the obvious moral purpose which underlies the book detracts from its merit as a work of art however dr barrys dialogue is vivid his descriptions occasionally first rate throughout there is no want of power only a little lack of proportion thus the tale of general greystoke and the fair syrian brought in in the old fashion of episodical digression though it sets forth the influence of heredity from a certain quarter on marians noble but singularly composite character is too elaborate  and the plots of the two dramas by elven though essential come into the narrative with a certain awkwardness if here be a polemical and professional touch it is in the presentment of the evangelicals in though english church mrs greystoke is a caricature though there is an amount of humorous truth in the portrait of her

accident to ruminate by the roadside grave of her who six and twenty years before had killed herself because of his lost love cupids wings having been curbed and the blinded god lured to a suburban destination throughout the tales in some degree the little ironies of life are illustrated so that we are brought to realise how absolutely mans strutting and gesticulating importance is a marionette

been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the

both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest

the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy

luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight

B4492,['8727555'],  tie city of dreadful xtght and other poems by james thomson reeves  turner tne principal poem in this volume is an allegory and it appears designed to be an allegory of human life if so mr thomson has succeeded in producing the worst constructed allegory of his time and this if we consider the claims of the  new paul and virginia is a feat to be recorded it is true no doubt that an allegory is at once more free and more restricted than a parable while the parable must always contain a story or incident which apart from its ethical niotiy is in itself vital and beautiful and yet embody that iothf as fully as though every detail had been sacrificed to it the allegory needs no such selfsupporting storyneeds nothing indeed but fidelity to symbol and intelligibility of intellectual intent this requirement however is indispensable for while the larable has something of the freedom and i b aindon of natures own productions and like them may suggest many anl various teachings the allegory can suggest blut one lesson or group of lessons and its very existence dependls upon its keeping strictly within a defined and arbi trary intellectual fence the moment the intelligent reader becomes doubtful about the subject of the allegorythe moment he begins to ask himself is the thing symbolised a city or a society or a creed  is it a man or a woman or a mood the success of the writer of the allegory has been no greater thaii thai of the animal painter who left it for  his patrons the public  to decide whether the creature represented was a horse or a hen or a pig in  the city of dreadful night the only intelligible intent to be discerned is that the poet for some reason or another wishes to make the reader feel that he is himself one of the dreadful occupants of a dreadful city in a word to make him as uncomfortable as possible mr thomson is good enough however to warn off such as have no desire to be made miserable impelled by the artists yearning to make things perfect he simply wishes to make more miserable those who are miserable nowto sit and moan to them and with them like villons old woman among her squalid friends assises bas a croppetons the unha py occupants of the dreadful city are according to mr thomson the atheists thus considered the poem is a bitter satire upon atheismsurely i write not for the hopeful young or those who deem their happiness of worth or such as pasture and grow fat among the shows of life and feel nor doubt nor dearth or pious spirits with a god above them to sanctify and glorify and love them or sages who foresee a heaven on earth for none of these i write and none of these could read the writing if they deigned to try so may they flourish in their due degrees on our sweet earth and in their unplaced sky if any cares for the weak words here written it must be some one desolate fatesmitten whose faith and hope are dead and who would die some will say no doubt that in endeavouring to add to the miseries of life mr thomson shows his knowledge of the recognised function of the contemporary poet and certainly from this point of view the book is suggestive why the muses were born at all though a puzzling question is not as sir thomas brown would say  beyond all conjecture hesiods explanation that they came to man in order to bring him forgetfulness of evils and a truce from cares may at one time have been adequate but in our time and especially since the publication some years ago of the first of the  dreadful  poems mr tod stoddards  deathwake or lunacy a necromaunt in three chimwras the muses have undertaken an entirely different kind of work hesiods saying must now be regarded as an indication of that primitive view of art which belongs to an epoch emerging from barbarism for the law of progress in the sciences which the germans say comte stole from them is seen in the  gay science more clearly than in any other the progress has here been so rapid that the gay science only exists because it is the science of tears and perhaps the reasons why poetry is now a drug to use the pathetic phrase of the booksellers may be mainly hygienic only the most robust constitutionthat is to say a constitution such as that of the hardened criticcan endure it and it is but just that he who inflicts so much misery upon others should undergo the exceptional misery of reading laureate odes to death and allegories depicting a city of dreadful night enlivened by only one ray of hope that of suicide and then annihilation yet it must not be really supposed that rhyming is the depressing occupation that it would be if these tearful bards were in earnest the humour of the entire situation lies in this that the poet who if people were to read and believe him would  lower the gastric power  of the country to a very serious extent has simply written idreadful  poetrybecausejust now it is the fashion to be drjedful even as in the time of a presv s james thomson the poet produced  elegant  poetry because it was the fashion to be elegant judging from such poems in this volume as sunday at hampstead and  sunday up the river mr thomson is the very opposite of what the author of the city of dreadful night would appear to the unsophisticated eyes of the general reader belonging apparently to a class which stands perhaps on the whole higher than any other in integrity and freedom from conventional nonsense the skilled british artisan mr thomson seems to love intellectual pursuits and to be of a jovial temperament to have a fine palate for distinguishing the various virtues of various brands of the whiskey whose praises he sings and a keen appreciation of the joys of a cockney picnic there is not much of the  dreadful night  in such thoughts as these which come to the poet naturally enough in such an interesting situationi am sinking sinking sinking it is hard to sit upright  your lap is the softest pillow i good night my love good night in such an enviable position he may well exult over the aristocrats who it seems like neither ladies laps nor sunshine but drawl and stare and simper so fine and cold and staid like exquisite waxwork figures

the earth slips from our feet to have written these three stanzas is a triumph why then did mr thomson afflict his readers with such a dreary mistake as the city of dreadful night that poem fills but fiftyfive small pages and yet excellent as the writing often is to conscientiously read it through is a weary task it would almost seem that to join original power with that sagacity which teaches its possessor how to exercise it is a feat beyond the power of nature to achieve savo in the rarest instances the way in which in literature a work of art is produced is commonly this the poet feels

B4015,"['6785067', '9406189', '8679551']",  the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a

openly and honestly by the only tianie to which they can fairly assert a rightnamely journals among this class however are to be found some few individuals who notwithstanding that the predominant qualities of their genius are essentially of the newspaper kind possess not only those qualities in a very transcendent degree but many of the noblest properties of the human mind more abundantly than

harrington vizard being a womanhater could not fail to faill an easy prey to whatever was most charming in woman so ina the wife in compliance with the very funnilyworded petitions of a theatrical agent in distress sings on a homburg stage and severne the husband unwittingly takes seats to this very stages front for his own ladylove brother and company so the complica tion begins for here the womanhater learns to love one more woman and here too the husband learns once more to dread his wife but the plot has not began to be laid in homburg for nothing and around the gaming tables it thickens ina klosking knowing the wicked husband to be a gambler and still apparently pining for his fair and false face seeks rougeetnoir in company with the quaint and faithful ashmead her admiring theatrical agent by a clever piece of plotmaking she plays in part with her own husbands money given hurriedly to ashmead by the guilty man himself as he sees his fair pursuer enter and given in trust that it may be gambled with for him by another ingenious arrangement zoe vizard and the womanhater have been witnesses of this transaction and as the beautiful gambler naturally breaks the bank with her winnings the plot becomes farther involved by severnes frantic efforts to obtain his lawful share of the gains even while preserving an incognito with his wife this lady though beautiful is however shrewdtoo shrewd even for the villain though from the luxurious safety of vizard court where he has been invited on the familys return and is outwitting the titled and honest suitor in miss zoes affections he sends an emissary of secret inquiry to homburg the lady of the contralto voice has the best of it by a riee of poor honest and vulgar ashmeads invention she leaves the present abode of the faithless one seeks heavenly strength against the cruel knowledge of his love for the fair damsel of the gambling saloon and then travels to england to be struck down in the hall of vizard court by the husband whose nearly completed arrangements with miss vizard are thus provokingly interrupted here then is the womanhaters chance and here is a chance also for somebody else whom we have omitted to mention namely a young woman by name rhoda gale and by profession a female doctor neither of these two persons allow the grass to grow under their feet the doctress by means of most scientifically described appliances plies her trade merrily unaccountably assisted by that most accessory of characters fanny dover the flirt between them they staunch the blood and bind up the temples becomingly and after that it is the womanhaters turn with chance and a really good stroke of business does he achieve in spite of his profession what with solemn church music such as is strange to this foreign singer what with gentle manly sympathy what with cynicism kept in abeyance and a judicious use of sables belonging to a defunct mother harrington vizard seems quickly to succeed in eradicating any soft sentiment for a wretched husband but let no one suppose that the noble ina klosking could be guilty even of the slightest of unworthy feelings on the contrary the whole force of her lofty spirit seems to be concentrated on the sufferings of zoe vizard whom she fain would save from the gay deceiver while sparing her the knowledge of his whole guilt indeed at the moment of departure from vizard court where she has been nursed her astonishment at harringtons declaration is masterly acted though she still unaccountably withholds from him the fact of her marriage apparently reserving the dis closure for a more effective scene and indeed the better occasion is fast approaching for the darkeyed heiress strangely blind to probabilities though still in ignorance of the positive fact about severnes marriage has fled in jealous sorrow to the house of an aunt where after cruelly encouraging the titled and honest suitor she falls once more a prey to the attractions of severne  all in black by the garden gate at nightfall not even the exciting effect of being saved from a bull by the good lover can outweigh the charms of the wicked one but upon the middle of the dusty highroad that leads to the registrar where they are to be secretly married zoe upon her lovers arm meets the good wife of this wicked husband who is there shamed before the faces of harrington and miss vizard and proceeds to have a fit whence he is saved by the doctress alas that miss rhoda gale should have been so clever for our third volume might not have existed whereas we must now follow the faithful ash mead through many grievous duties in managing the villain while we lavish sympathy on the despairing but constant womanhater on the pallid and sorrowing zoe on the patiently performing klosking till after many vicissitudes the husband is at length really killed by a fall through a theatre trapdoor while in pursuit of a balletdancer for which feat he is rewarded by the tender and constant care of his hitherto obdurate wife by the most learned attention of miss rhoda gale md so severne dies pathetically polite and fascinating to the last though hopelessly wicked and who shall need to be told that though shocked and sorrowing awhile ina klosking marries the proprietor of vizard court or that after a period of some pallor the fair zoe takes pity upon that titled and honest lover a novel by mr charles read requires but little criticism with the public beyond the mere remark that it is by mr charles reade and to a writer of such wellassured popularity an individual opinion can signify not at all so that we feel quite able to give our criticism as follows that miss rhoda gales medical experiences difficulties and successes are far too lengthily dwelled upon for the limits of a novel that mr reades treatment of female character is generally far from ideal and often crude and even coarse that mr reades undue emphasis of trifling realistic incident though designed to give colour to his writing is too often almost absurdly forcible that mr reades originality however striking at first comes when sifted to be scarcely worthy the name at all and yet the story remainswhat work always must be from the hands of so shrewd and clever a workman a story of decided interest and even of excitement so wellpractised a student of everyday life could scarcely fail to be keenly astute about the subterfuge of female character and the curious inconsistency even of the more logical male mind and mr read can here make us laugh and almost cry by his sharp hits at both perhaps in his strange vagueness of motive and sometimes unaccountable fondness for small if startling incident above sound and deeper truths mr read has chosen to strike a comment and point a moral on modern life with its rapid and frivolous inconsistency rather than to draw a picture of the better and higher ideal of comparative perfection and beauty,history_contra

of their countrymen that high principle and great talents will under favourable circumstances always command we will even go so far as to say that they have attained to that goodliness of reputation that scurrilous attacks upon them for their spirited yet urbane advocacy of all that tends to promote religious and civil liberty are no longer necessary to make that fame durable that is already so general mary howitt has placed another testimony upon record in the volumes before us that she is fully deserving of her share ot the family honours till they are read few can comprehend how much purity of spirit can be combined with much fervour of imagination i h these volumes we will essay to give the reader a faint idea we believe that the groundwork of it is not fiction it is so domestic so beautiful in its homeliness that invention it ought not to be a family her own goes down to take possession of an inheritance near sunbury and the stories connected or supposed to be connected with the neighbourhood form the staple of the novel for such after all it must be called  for the events throughout arc linked together so as to form what our neighbours the french call a totalitc about one quarter of the first volume is occupied with a description of the surrounding families and the idiosyncracies of their various inmates all this is beautiful writing and for the most part calculated to make us love more ardently our species it also is full of local scenery  indeed through all the volumes there is a superabounding of the pastoral we love the country with ardour an ardour perhaps the more intense that rural pleasures are dealt out to us so sparingly and we love also the writings which describe them but we speak with hesitation it is a matter of mere taste and our taste may be faulty but we think that mary howitt has been rural almost to tediousness take any three or four pages of her continuous descriptions of scenery and we shall find them exquisite  but she still describes and thenand thenwe say it unwillinglywe grow a little weary the descriptions seemed to us in the midst of our admiration like the rapid views we gain of a fine country through the windows of a postchaise travelling quickly  another and another and anotherwe felt overpowered by a succession of beauties the first story of any length incidental to wood leighton is  the sinners grave certainly the most pathetic that we ever read this is the mere fact we found it distressingly so we think that it would have been as a whole much better had it not been so very agonizing the authoress seems to have tried how severely she could wring the heart we do not like uv be thus fooled into tears and to have recourse to twenty little stratagems to conceal the violence of our emotions from whomever may be near us when we read wc know all this will be its best recommendation to the generality of readers your regular devourer of fiction like your inveterate snufftaker requires after a time strong stimulants however this will satisfy them the moral of this tale is excellent and enforced with the strong gentleness of a woman and the authority of an apostle after this strong excitement in order to be quietly let down from our altitudes we haye some excellent gossip about rambles and wayfarers and beggars all in a smooth gossiping gentlewomanly way after we have thus subsided into a dreamy and pleasant quietude we are introduced to the arena in which we find the heirs expectant here mary howitt again becomes great in her strength and vigorously couches her lance against pride in all its hateful ay and in all its graceful disguises too this is a noble talethe pride of power for powers sake which is tyrannythe pride of circumstance anel situation which is follythe pride of stratagem and circumvention which is wickednessand the pride of possessing masses of unused wealth which is avariceare all in their turns exposed aud castigated flus is the holding up of the mirror to mens vices we are strongly inclined to give an outline of this eventful story and of some of the terrible scenes that it involves  hut as to many readers the gradually unwinding of the skein of the narrative aud thus feeding their curiosity discreetly is one of their greatest pleasures we will not rudely tear oh the veil but allow every one to withdraw it from the picture as slowly and as gradually as he chooses lu all sincerity we tell our frieuels that works like this which we are noticing will tend to place the novel in the highest class of writing and make it almost the only vehicle for the inculcation of domestic morality and the rectitude of private life they have already driven the essay from the field of literature we are not sorry for it it is epiite as pleasant to be won as to be coerced to wisdom aud in this light we consider our gifted authoress as au ethical instructress we will dilate no longer on the merits of  wood leighton did we express what we thought of them those who have not read the work might think us guilty of exaggeration whilst those who have might with more justice accuse us either with incapacity sufficiently to commend it or

are in fact two sorts of linguists the men who by study of literature win to themselves a closet use of many languages for the enlargement of their sphere of knowledge and reflection are distinctly to be parted from the men who by devotion to small talk pick up a variety of languags and speak them all glibly and idiomatically becu the have given themselves up with equal stisfaction to enjoyment of the shallow idleness of a dozen towns of a dozen different nations these linguists who are helped to become what they are by want of thoughtfulness are really the dull proftless men mr odowd finds them when lord wad replied to prince schwartzenbergs flippant remark on the bad french of english diplomatists by the apology that we had not enjoyd the advantoge of having our capital cities so ofen occupied by french troops s romi of our neighbours he uttered not merely a smart epigram but a great philosopbical truth it was not alone that we had not possessed the opportunity to pick up an accent but that we had not subordinated our minds and habits to french modes and ways of thought and that the tone and temper of the french people had not been beaten into us by the roll of a french drum one may buy an accomplishment too dearly it is possible to pay too much even for a parisian pronunciation i not only have i never found a linguist a man of eminence but i have neve seen a linguist who talked well fluent they are of course like the stecknadel gun of the prussiani they can fire without cessation but like the same weapon they are comparatively aimles it is a feu roulanl with plenty of noise and some smoke but very few casualties announce the succes the greatest linguist of b modem europe mezzofanti was a most inferior man of the countries whose dialect he spoke to perfection he

an insolent confidence they fall back upon the petty superiority of their iluency and lord it over those who are immeasurably their masters just as blondin might run along the rigging of a threedocker and pretend that his agility entitled him to command a squadron  xr odowd comments truly on the servility to france common among italian politicians but we suspect that in the following passage there is some excess in his application of like censure to the italian people is it not partly because they speak over the heads of their own people with their faces turned to the french mecca that there is the want of a full national accord between parliament men and the main body of the nation  i have often heard public speakers mention thedifficulty of adjusting the voice to the size of a room in which they found themselves for the first time and the remark occurred to me as figuratively displaying one of the difficulties of italian public men the speakers in reality near clearly knew how far their words were to carrywhether they spoke to the chamber or to the country is there or is there not a public opinion in italy  can the public speiker direct his words over the beads of his immediate surrounders to countles thousands beyond them  if he cannot parliament is but a debating club with the disadvantage of not being able to select the subjects for discussion the glow of patriotism is never rightly warm nor is the metal of party truly lleable without the strong blast of a public opinion i the turin chamber has no echo in the country and so far as i swe the italians are far more eager to learn what is said in the french parliament than in their own  i remember aa old waiter at the hibernian hotel in dublin who got a prize in the lottery and retired into private life but who

son at present we are not aware of facts that would justify us in bringing a charge of vanity against the not unknown author of these unquestionably amusing essays but there can be no injustice in hinting that the authors friends and those other persons who have laboured to place the book favourably before the world are to be commended for zeal rather than discretion some weeks have elapsed since the papers were gathered from the pages of a monthly magazine and according to the current slang of the literary market were  offered to the public in a collected form and from the date of their republication up to the present time the readers of gossip in english and continental journals have been almost daily assured that society is burning with a strong desire to penetrate the mystery of the writers noni de plume and discover whether he bc mr this or sir soandso that a month since the english tourists assembled in paris were informed by a paper well known in the hotels of the continent that public opinion in the british islands still remained in doubt whether cornelius odowd paid rent and taxes under the name of cornelius odowd or was but a name assumed for professional purposes by a distinguished literary baronet or some other familiar novelist it was gravely asserted that for months past the clubs of pall mall the smokingroom of the house of commons and all other institutions to which the popular mind attributes an excess of bootless curiosity had incessantly and vainly striven to trace odowd to his particular writingdesk that at ball and fete the first question put by a fashionable lady to her friends was sure to be an inquiry for the private history of the brilliant essayist and that interest in the purely personal affairs of the new censor of  men and women disturbed the even flow of gossip at provincial teaparties it is scarcely necessary to say that this intelligence was a surprise to us we could recall a time when all the world between the hebrides and the crimea exclaimed with one voice who is dowb but though we had spent a large portion of the preceding twelve months in social intercourse with our fellowmen we could not remember a single occasion when human voice had asked us who is dowd we turned from the puff with a suspicion that our own state with regard to the particular question did not widely differ from the experiences of the rest of our fellowcountrymen either in society or out of it in justice to the author we must say that his book in no waystands in needof dishonest praise it is so sure of receiving a liberal amount of unbought eulogy that those who are responsible for the success of its voyage through the shoals and quicksands of circulating libraries may confidently decline the aid of flatterers the papers are cheerful brilliant articles on a few of those light and not important topics in which the clever idlers of cultivated society find their principal amusement of continental life as it may be seen by observant tourists through the windows of fashionable hotels mr cornelius odowd gives some clever pictures and occasionally he sketches national character with a erecision and delicacy that induce us to regard im as one who has lived in foreign countries for higher ends than mere pastime his paper on italian traits and characteristics is admirable  and his essay on  adventurers and his sketch of  r n f the great chevalier dindustrie of our day will cause much hearty laughter and lessen the number and success of that numerous body of english swindlers who prey on the simplicity of foreign innkeepers and the credulity of british tourists indeed every paper in the collection will bear a second reading besides perfect command of his pen mr cornelius odowd displays judgement and tact never found in like degree in an untried writer well aware that in these busy and frivolous days workers have little time and idlers no humour for grave moral treatises he plies his readers liberally with anecdote and satire assuming his drollest aspects and making his brightest jests at the moments when he is most anxious to give profitable counsel for the greater part his illustrative stories are old tales familiar to all who have dined with the witty conversationalists of the departing generation  but his mode of producing an old mot is so thoroughly artistic that we could imagine ourselves laughing over joe millers drowsy witticisms if cornelius odowd edited them with his peculiar piquancy habitual narrators of timeworn tales who are guilty ol the common error of expanding their good stories in the belief that by overlaying an anecdote with new phrases they can draw attention from the antiquity or feebleness of its point would do well to take a lesson in their not lofty art from this new master of colloquial narration who employs words with equal discernment and parsimony and takes every opportunity to flatter his readers sagacity by allowing them to pick up the pearl which he has thrown before them and to complete the story which he has intentionally left not quite finished perhaps the paper in which the art of the storyteller is seen to best advantage is the sketch entitled a friend of giobertis this little piece is in its way a perfect gem of humour and cunning touch and though it takes up scarcely twenty minutes of the readers time it is a work of prose fiction that would reward the labour of any dramatic writer who should put it properly on the stage thc following passage from  the decline of whistthe most whimsical and wrongheaded of all the writers drolleriesmay be taken as j a fair sample of his style the late cabinet of lord derby contained some good players two of the secretaries of state j were actually fine players and one of them adds whist to accomplishments which would have made their possessor an admirable crichton if genius had not elevated him into a far loftier category than crichton belongs to rechberg plays well and likes his game but be is in whist as are all a j germans a thorough pedant i remember an inci  dent of his whistlife sufficiently amusing in its i way though in relation the reader loses what to myself is certainly the whole pungency of the j  story i mean the character and nature of the per j son who imparted the anecdote to me and who is about the most perfect specimen of that selfpossese sion which we call coolness the age we live in can s boast of i own that in a very varied and somey  what extensive experience of men in many coune  trie i never met with one who so completely v  fulfilled all the requisites of temper manner face h courage and selfreliance which make of a human ir  being the most unabashable and unemotional creal8  ture that walks the earth i tell the story as nearly jx  as i can as he related it to me i used to play a good  deal with rechberg said he and took pleasure in worrying him fer he was a great purist in his play x  and was outraged with anything that could not be a  sustained by an authority in fact each game was d followed by a discussion of full half an hour to the s  intense mortification of the other players though r j very amusing to me and offering me large oppor1 tunity to irritate and plague the austrian one d evening after a number of these discussions in r j which rechberg had displayed an even unusual y warmth and irritability 1 found myself opposed to him in a game the interest of which had drawn around us a large assembly of spectatorswhat the french designate as la alarie towards the conclusion of the game it was my turn to lead and i played a card which so astounded the austrian minister that he laid down his cards upon the n  table and stared fixedly at me  in all my expeys rience of whist said he deliberately i never ee  saw the equal of thatof what asked i southeast  of the card you have jubt played rejoined he it is not merely that such play violates every principle of the game but it actually stultifies all your own combinations i think differently count said i  i maintain that it is good play and i abide by it let us decide it by a wager said hein what waythus we shall leave the question to the galerie you shall allege what you deem to bethe reasons for your play and they shall decide if they accept them as valid i agree what will you betten napoleons twenty fifty five hundred if you like   cried he warmly i shall say ten you dont like losing and i dont want to punish you too heavily  there is the jury sir said he haughtily  make your casethe wager is this said i that to win i shall satisfy these gentlemen that for the card i played i had a sufficient and good reason yesmy reason was this theni looked into your hand i pocketed his ten napoleons but thoy were the last i won of him indeed it took a month before he got over the shock  hiving been generous to cornelius odowd we must now be just to the reader a hint will suffice to indicate that the essayist is not without his faults we could point to more than one place where his rifle misses fire when it is maliciously pointed at an adversary two or three of the later papers are very inferior to though best chapters of the volume on climbing boys for instance signally exposes the writer to the fine thread of the critics lash the whole fun of thu essay consists in an overstrained comparison of sweeps and statesmen  it would says the writer be temptingbut i resist the temptationto show how many points of resemblance unite themhow each works in the dark in a small narrow confined sphere without views or outlet how the tendency of each is to scratch his way upwards and gain the top caring wonderfully little how black and dirty the process has made him a volume might be written on the subtle artifices adopted to keep them littlethe browbeatings the insults the crushing cruelties the spare diet intermixed with occasional stimulants the irregular hours and the heat and confinement of the sphere they work in still nature is stronger than all these crafty contrivances the little sweep will grow into the big sweep and the small undersec will scratch his way up to the cabinet mr cornelius odowd is a clever fellow and boasts that he has  been everywhereeaten of everythingseen everything but notwithstanding his modest assurance we are inclined to suspect that he has never seen a smarts chimney sweeping

she dedicates herself to him and brings him up bravely sir richard himself is represented as almost human perfection cut short at the kneehandsome stately wellformed possessing in every respect an ideal physique with the exception of his shorn extremities the result of the feet being planted on to the extremities of the thighs rendered it impossible for him to be furnished with artificial limbs hence he could only hobble about in a more or less hideous fashion the first half of the book is devoted to a description of how the poor boy thus marred from birth grows up and suffers keenly at

honest love i will have gratified lust my imagination has been stimulated into rather dangerous activity by the prenatal insult put upon me and now that i have emancipated myself i propose to apply my imagination practically he is as good as his word and he embarks upon a wild career of debauchery and unnatural and morbid vice in the midst of it all he still cherishes love for helen his cousin whom in spite of the wreck of all his other gods he continues to cherish in a secret temple of his own as the one pure woman in the world in reality she is a veritable messalina although as the authoress says in a sentence of almost unique coarseness in modern novels the artist was at least as present in her as the whore and to the delineation of this great courtesan with fine aesthetic appreciations and inevitable animality lucas malet devotes herself with a minutenessof analysis much more frequently found in french than in english novels for some reason or other lucas malet appears to be fascinated by this shepanther of a woman she paints her minutely in almost every phase of emotion she describes the woman with the licentious city of naples as a background deliberately laying her snares and completing her arrangements to lure her cousin to his undoing it is not often that in english fiction there is a picture drawn at full length and in vivid colours of the way of a strange woman with the man whom she has marked down for her victim and what makes the thing all the more horrid is the emphasis which lucas malet lays upon the effect of physical deformity as an incentive to sensual desire in the midst of a scene in which helen was plying all her arts in order to fire calmadys blood sir richard had to move his positionshe stared fascinated by that cruel spectacle for the instant transformation of the apparently tall and conspicuously wellfavoured courtly gentleman just now sitting at table with her into this shuffling longarmed crippled dwarf was at first utterly incredible then portentous then by virtue of its very monstrosity absorbing and to her adorable whetting appetite as veritable famine might chastity became to her more than ever absurd a culpable waste of her own loveliness of sensation of emotion a sin against those vernal influences working in this generous nature surrounding her and working in her own blood all the primitive instinct of her womanhood called aloud in her that she must wedmust wed and the strident voice of the great painted city coming up to her urgent incessant carried the same message as did the radiant sea whose white lips kissed the indented coastline as though pale and hungry with love while the nan before her by his very abnormality and a certain secretness inevitable in that heightened her passion he was to her of all living men most desirable so that she must win him and hold him must see and know of course the inevitable result follows she held this man in the hollow of her hand by right divine of beauty wit and the manifold seductions of her richly endowed personality this of her many loves was the crown and the climax as the adulteress hunts for the precious life so this lithe shepanther tracked down her prey and triumphed without remorse in the satisfaction of her revenge and the consummation of her desire like her prototype in the book of proverbs she ate and drank and said  i have done no evil it is very different with her victim calmady who had wilfully trampled under foot all canons of morality and was shocked back into virtue by the sudden destruction of his last ideal  the last of mv selfmade gods he told her has indeed gone overboard he fled from the scene of his undoing took refuge on board his yacht but venturing out feverstricken to attend the opera he was again tracked down by his conqueror who came to him in his box and vowed her determination never to leave him  richard she said very softly laying her hand lightly upon his thighi forgive all i am not satisfied with loving i will come with you i will stay with you i will be faithful to you yes yes even that your love is unlike any other it is unique as you yourself are unique i want more of it  her lips were parted in naughty laughter and then not without a shrinking of quick horror richard beheld the soul in herthat being of lovely proportions exquisitely formed in every part yet black as the foul liquid lanes between the hulls of the money ships dowvn in naples harbourstep delicately in between those parted lips returning whence it came he refused to go with her whereupon she summoned a former lover into the box who struck richard again and again across the face with his metalbuttoned gloves calmady tried to strike him and fell heavily stunning himself as his temples struck the lower step of the descent from the back of the box the man kicked calmady as he lay asking  dear madame are you sufficiently avenged is it enough helen expressed herself satisfied and the two went out into the blackness of the dark night the third part of the book describes the regeneration of sir richard calmady the fever possessed him and he came for a time near to the door of death he was nursed back by his mother who rejoiced to welcome back the prodigal who had found the husks which the swine did eat so very bitter to his taste sir richards repentance was genuine and final his mother had the satisfaction of finding for him an excellent wife from whom he conceals nothing either of his deformities or of his lapses from the straight path her acceptance of him is characteristic and somewhat original  for heavens sake she said  dont take me out of pity i would never forgive you there is a good deal of us both one way and another and we should give each other a hell of a time if i was in love and you were not butshe put her hand on the peak of that very ugly saddle again but if you do care here i am i am yours body and soul marry me she said having made up her mind to accept him she found that his crippling was dearer to her than any other mans wholeness and his wrongdoings dearer than any other mans virtue what wve wonder wvould people think if a man were to say such a thing to a woman like helen everything goes so well that in the last page he tells his mother he is thankful that she brcught him into the world even as he was which was good for the most perfect of mothers to hear speaking of the book as a whole no one can deny its ability or the nerve of its authoress  but whether it is a book which makes altogether for edification is a question upon which readers will probably agree to differ whatever other significance it has it undoubtedly marks a definite stride forward across the barriers which have hitherto differentiated the english from the french novel

B1237,"['8673696', '8502457', '4384134']",  in silk attire new novels by william black 3 vols tinsley brothers allowing for the improbability which lies at the root of this novel and which leads to some minor faults of the same kind we say at once that in silk attire is thoroughly pleasant and readable marked by much and varied cleverness mr blacks plot is not in itself a new one the unavoidable rivalry between two girls who are in love with and are almost equally loved by the same man has often been treated but in the present instance the contrast is not so strongly felt as usual both girls are worthy both are unselfish each seems to wish the other to win it must have given mr black great pain to have to cut the knot if we cannot fully sympathise with him that is owing to the way in which the opening improbability is brought back again at the closeand has an air of bringing down the curtain perhaps mr black would urge in excuse that with an actress for his heroine stage effect is allowable he would add further that his heroines mother was an actress and that what is bred in the bone will never come out in the flesh the episode of annie brunels birth and infancy which serves as a prologue to the story has of course been put in for the bearing it has on this side of her character and makes the transformationscene at the end less abrupt but even this does not reconcile us to it wholly and with all mr blacks skill we never quite get over the beginning and the end of his story all we can say in their favour is that the author never loses sight of them they have their effect on the whole conduct of the plot if we forget them now and then and if we enjoy the book most when we do forget them mr black has not set us the example he is consistent throughout and is alike true to what is natural and what is unnatural the faults of the story swell the success of the artist when we dismiss from our minds this aspect of the novel we find that in other respects there is a want of absolute freshness and originality pleasant as the characters are and clearly as they are drawn they are only variations on the old types count schbnstein for instance the man who has made a fortune in business and bought a german title without being able to speak the language is merely new in his surroundings we think mr black ought to do better ought to be able to strike out something new in itself instead of contenting himself with placing things in a new light so too mr anerley the father of the hero is intended to be a likeness of the modern materialist and he is great in the scandal he causes to the clergyman of the parish in the difficult theories he inflicts on womankind in the goodnatured sarcasm which is infused into all his words as naturally as smoke is breathed from between the lips that sustain a pipe mr anerley is capitally drawn and we delight in his paradoxes  only we know him already we made his acquaintance in days when materialism had not yet laid its icy clutch upon him when he still went to church or was kept at home by a slight return of his old complaint when he did not suggest that it was a sign of imperfect development in a scotchman not being born with a macintosh here again we think mr black might have done better we have no such objection to make to his two heroines of the two we prefer dove anerley partly because she is more complete in herself partly because mr black so cruelly sacrifices her the change which is wrought in the character of annie brunel when she conies off the stage and mixes with other people is in some sense significant of her part in the novel we know more of her as an actress than as a woman yet mr black professes to show her to us as a woman and only to tell us what she did as an actress we must take her great artistic powers and success more or less upon trust and if they seem to us exaggerated we have no means of testing mr blacks account of them but the woman is brought nearer to us and we are called upon to judge her from our natural point of view here we confess dove anerley shows to greater advantage though mr black will hardly see it he may not take it as a compliment to be told that his minor characters do him yet more credit but we are far from intending this to be a censure the distinction that may be drawn between his fulllengths and his miniatures is that in the one we miss either novelty or power in the other we are able to do justice to cleverness and observation when mr black sketches the surface of life the daily occurrences when he pictures the retired teabroker acting as country gentleman in kent and still more when the counts foot is on the soil with which he bought his title nothing can be pleasanter the days shooting in the black forest is a perfect scene what with count schonsteins bad german and his general awkwardness what with the fine figure of the tall keeper and will anerleys accident our interest is fully excited and we share the regrets of all the party at the necessity ofa return to england but there are scenes in england which are worthy of being named by the side of this one and english characters by no means inferior to the counts faithful but unintelligible germans all that concerns mr anerley himself is as good as all that concerns count schonstein with the same abatement as to the principal characters and with one grave exception the ruin of the anerleys and mr anerleys last interview with the count are a blot on the novel and the more so that they are alien to the usual bent of mr blacks ability at least no other part of the story can be called poor whatever else may be said against it  in silk attire a novel by william black in three volumes tinley brothers a strange wild story of our own times very subtly told a young marquis marries an actress of great talent and high popularity she does not care to face his noble friends and relations he srinks from introducing her to them so they go abroad avoid english society and settle at thun wheu their only child is four yea old the husband suddenly tyres of his bnient and longs for london life pleads business takes leave of his wife affectionately and hurries away sending his man of business after the lapse of a few weeks to offer her whatever income she may desire she covers her broken heart with a mantle of pride and refuses to accept more money than will suffice to carry her to new york where she resolves to resume her profession for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  those whom god had joined  become utter strangers to each other but after a few years the marquis lying on his deathbed repents of the wrong he has done his wife and makes the only reparation now in his power by bequeathing to her and their daughter the whole of his property his executors who hardly knew of her existence have much difficulty in discovering her abode for her theatrical reputation is not now worldwide as it had been in her early days the old fire had gone out when trouble fell upon her when the lawyer waits upon her to announce her good fortune he is astounded by her renunciation of the proffered wealth he begs her to reconsider her decision urging the advantage to her daughter of being placed in the position of an english lady she replies that her daughter has been brought up in total ignorance of her birth and thinks it best that she should remain so she feels acutely how muuch happier her own life would have been had she never passed beyond the bounds of her profession and desires that her daughter should know nothing of the outer world however she will give her the lawyers address and tell her to apply to him should she ever find herself in distress this introduction to the main story for it is the daughter who is the real heroine is improbable in fact and questionable in taste it seems to us a mistake to have opened the book with it calculated as it is to produce an unfavourable impression on the readers mind it would have been better first to have excited an interest in the wonderful annie brunel and then to have gratified the readers curiosity by accounting in some measure for the strongly developed features of her remarkable character in telling the strange story of her birth and the sad tale of her mothers sufferings and wrongs let the reader open the book at the fourth chapter and he will find the orphan girl in london at the zenith of her fame as an actress her juliet is a complete success and we will venture to say as to our authors conception of the character that it is certain be cannot have seen the part so played we must unfortunately go back l to theatrical traditions for such an impersonation of shakespeares betwitching creation l suddenly there was an extraordinary commotion throughout i the house and a burst of that fine strong thunderous music which artists love to hearand then dove saw advance a girlishlooking creature with a calm somewhat pale and interesting face i and beautiful black hair she was only girlish in the slightness i of her figure there was an artistic completeness in her motions and a selfpossession in her bearing which gave her something of a queenly look she wore a magnificent white satin dress the train of which lay in splendid masses behind her and down over this white and gold fell a black lace veil partly hiding the rich i hair and enclosing the clear beautiful dark face dove was spellbound by that face it somehow suggested italy to her and blue skies and music and the passiona artistic warmth of the south nor was the illusion destroyed by the low chestvoice with which the girl replied to the questions of mother and from that moment dove thought no more of mliss brunel and wills friend 1 she saw only juliet and followed her sad story with an aching heart anl trembling lip during the matchless balconyscene will saw this intense sympathetic emotion growing upon the girl i believe it is con e sidered to be the proper thing for young ladies to be able to turn l round and smile compassionately to each other when the traic sadness on the stage is making the women in the pit sob bitterly and raising great lumps in the throats of the mei it is a pretty accomplishment in its way and may be indicative of other l iualities which these young persons arc accused of possessing doves emotional tendencies had never been educated however  and in this balconyscene as i say size watched the lovers with a painful interest which wrote its varying story every moment on her face the theatre was still as death the scarcelyuttered l tendernessesof juliet were heard ts distinctly as if they had been i breathed into ones ear and the yes of the audience frank in  the trembling lights and shadows ot her girlish passion with an unconscious delight and admiration elie abandonment of her affection the reluctant declaratioirs the coy shrinkings and piteous playful tender apologies were so blcnded as to niakc the n scene an artistic marvel and dove sat laughin maist like to greet as the old scotch song says tnii cd she scarcely knew t whether to laugh or cry with the delightthe absolute delight which this piece of true art gave her and wheti at last juliet had forced herself to the partingtis almost morning i would have thee gonc r and yet no farther than a wart nis bird t who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twist gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty  i when lingeringly and sadly she had withdrawn from the t balcony dove rose suddenly and with a halfchoked sob in her voice sad  oh will i should like so much to see herandxd  kies her she had nearly said but thinking it might be ridiculous she stopped  its against the rules dove said will with a smile  be sides that isnt miss brunel youve been looking at tat s b juliet both are very nice ladies bus they are quite unlike eah other a  a a  just as the curtain fell upon the scene in friar lawrences cell at the end of the second act mr melton conducted dove and will down a tortuous little stone stair into a narrow passage from which they entered into the wings a noisy and prolonged reca1 was thundering throughout the house and miss brunel was being led on to the stage by romeo to receive renewed plaudits when x she returned and passed under the glare of the jets in one of the 3 entrances will went forward to shake hands with her  i have to congratulate you again he said  thank you she said simply there had been a pleased smile of welcome in her eyes when r they met and yet it seemed to him that there was a strange intense expression in her look which was not natural to it once or twice before he had seen her in the same circumstances and invariably this unconscious mesmeric intensity was present in her i eyes he explained it to himself by supposing that the emotional idealism of her assumed character had not quite died out of her i yet then she turned and saw dove standing with mr melton will r begged to introduce his sister and the brief ceremony was sufficiently singular for a moment the dark lambent eyes of miss brunel were fixed upon the fair young girl with a sort of s hesitating lookan inquiring apprehensive look which will never forgot then all at once she frankly extended her band l dove a little frightened approached and shook hands with her  mr anerley has spoken to me about you said annie brunel i and dove was conscious that the darkhaired girl before her knew 3 her secret how singular it was to hear herself addressed in those low rich tones which a few minutes ago were addrcssing romeo in the r moonlight dove almost felt herself enchanted and could have ri believed at that moment that she herself belonged to the old sad e sweet play which seems to contain everything that was ever uttered about mans love and womans devotion e i must go down to my dressingroom now said miss brunel f to dove  will you come with me if you are curious to see r the place  i will send some one round with you to your box afterwards  will saw that dove would like to go so he settled the proposal by telling her not to be in miss brunels way and then he and 0 melton returned to the front of the house i while she is on the stage she ceases to be annie brunel  and becomes for the time the character she represents 3but this heavensent actress is mortal she loses her heart i and as the woman developes the actress dies out she begins to feel a loathing for her profession she has become lselfconscious she sees the people who are staring at her i she resolves to quit the stage and then there comes the ivery serious question how to live it is only as a last resource that she applies to the lawyers whose address her mother had confided to her the reader who has followed her thus far who has rejoiced with her in her professional triumphs who has pitied her misplaced love and felt for her in her distresses will be quite prepared to sympathise with her in her prosperity and admire the true nobility of her character equal even to the severe test of sudden unexpected and almost unimaginable wealth indeed the tale would have been more believable had the property been less enormous the rank of her father rather less exalted the ideal actress is admirably contrasted with the real actress a very pleasant kindhearted little lady a staunch friend in adversity though at times addicted to frivolity the lover is a welldrawn sketch of a thorough englishman very well meaning but rather weak in purpose who being engaged to a very tender sweet girl allows himself to fall desperately in love with the brilliant actress and has not the tact to keep his secret his efforts to bind up the broken heart are very commendable but the great truth that it is a mischief past repair is very forcibly and pathetically told the picture of his family circle is a truthful home scene of english country life and life in london amongst theatrical people is admirably sketched there ale pleasant views upon the rhine with its quaint old cities and majestic breadth of waters ruined towers and vineclad hills and some highly picturesque and characteristic scenes in the black forest where the vulgar millionaire of the tale who persecutes poor annie with his addresses has bought an estate which gives him the title of count his attentions to miss brunel are very far from being so disinterested as he strives to make them appear when he urges his suit with the promise that s she shall walk in silk attire for he happens to know who she really is and has a clear intention of claiming her property if he can only cajole her into becoming his wife the pretensions and the soliloquies of this purseproud retired teabroker are very absurd yet we cannot call the character overdrawn the many touches of his apparent generosity in which a reference to the promotion of one or other of his pet schemes may always be detected are very skilfully thrown in and his notion that all the world is bound to do his bidding and help forward his plans is a clever exemplification of the views of many a prosperous mana persuasicf which has probably aided him in achieving his prosperity we wish the book the success it deserves it possesses much originality it is agreeably written the characters are thoroughly lifelike and carefully thought outcertainly the heroine is almost too good to be true we have spoken of her as an ideal for though such an artiste may not now exist it is an accepted fact that such have been and there certainly is no reason why so perfect an actress should not be as perfect a lady as noble as generous as sensitive as truehearted as lovable as teachable as pure we much prefer the creation of so glorious a being to the representation of a mere ordinary mortal those who are not of our way of thinking may find in dove anerley a young lady more suited to their taste  in silk attirm the three first chapters of this story which form a sort of prologue introduce us to annie napier a distinguished actress who while in the height of her fame is wooed and won and married by harry ormond marquis of knottingley who carries his wife to switzerland dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her or otherwise make her life miserable after living with his wife several years on the shore of a swiss lake during which time a child is born to them harry ormond takes a longing to revisit england which he does leaving behind him both wife and child whom he never again sees arriving in england he thinks it better or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better not to return to his wife any more but to live apart from her the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful marchioness of knottingley declining a separate maintenance which he offers her the marchioness retires to new york where under the name of brunel she once more goes upon the stage to which she also trains her daughter annie brunel whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother at the death of the marquis ten years after his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by  acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property of this however she refuses to avail herself choosing rather to live by her profession and she arranges with the english lawyers that even her daughter who knows nothing of her real rank shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality when she may learn her position and claims thus far the prologue the story then follows the fortunes of annie brunel the young american actress who has captivated the heart of london by the brilliancy of her genius we get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the playthe party consisting of mr melton the manager miss brunel with several other members of the company a number of critics aparvenu count the graf von slchonstein will anerley a friend of the count and others who figure in the tale this is among the first glimpses we get of annie brunelslight in figure and somewhat pale and dark there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features and a stateliness in her gestures which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey they were eyes under those long eyelashes capable of a great sadness and yet they were not sad there seemed to play around the beautiful intellectual face a bright superficial unoonsciou activity and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her for the rest she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists and there ended in a faint line of blue and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it the artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of for she wams an arist one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage  for once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter meltabandonment of her impersonations p on the stage she was no longer mistress of herself her eyes deepened until they were almost black her face was stirred with the white light of peasion and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore when the sudden intensity died down when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres she seemed to have come out of a trance not a trace remained of that ore and those intonations which were the result of uncomsious cration her eyes resumed their serene happy indifference her face its pleased childlike expression swif bive dexterous she was full of all sorts of genial marry activities that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dreamlife she led elsewhere this is annie brunel the actress and unknown to herself marchionese of knottingley holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance some of which soon force themselves into fact for it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever the story of her parentage is known to count von schonstein who has it from his brother a member of the firm which is the depository of the knottingleybrunel romance and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play having met mis brunel before in ia sin atty a novel b wilim bla author of i love or mariage thm vols losdom  tiniey i america he renews his acquaintance with her in england and with the knowledge of her parentage resolves to marry her if he can expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility one can feel of course that the count cannot be the man and as the result proves in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes he fails but the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness but because a better man is bound to succeed and that man as the prophetic instinct perceives can be nobody but will anerley yet one is puzzled at this for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation in the first place there seems no necessity for it then although as annie brunel and will become acquainted they grow to like each other liking is not exactly loving besides she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady a distant relation of his own dove anerley who has been brought up in his own family down at st marykirby in pleasant kent in spite however of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary though one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that somehow the destinies of will anerley and annie brunel are steadily converging towards each other and will finally become one in the mean time there remains the difficulty of dove anerley whose portrait is thus suggested it was one of those rare faoes which tantalise you in the eryact of admiring them there was nothing in it of that mature vigorous definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman but a tender uncertainty a halfsuggested and shrinking loveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features it was not that the girl samed unwell or in any degree fragile but simply that one in looking at her face could not help regretting that her loveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes this is the lady who has been the companion of will anerleys youth whom he loves and to whom he has been spiritually if not formally affianced long before he encounters annie brunel but that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change in physical and mental structure will who is the son of a country gentleman is a thorough englishman and is above treachery and deception he does not deceive and desert dove anerleybe does not even cease to love her but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound inspired by the young actress who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentleminded dove it all seems natural and inevitableand as inevitable too that annie brunel should fall in love with will anerley the two are thrown much together during a trip to count schdnsteins residence in the black forest in germany and on wills return to england dove notices the change in manner and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause yet as if foreboding what the end is to be she hardly resents the change in her lover a change also comes over annie brunel remembering the teaching of her mother she conceals her passion for will feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession and even when their mutual affection is confesed they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of dove anerley whom wim is bound in honour to marry the impossible game of suppression goes on for some time when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress the power of genius seems to die within her in the light of her strong passion the idea of a higher life dawns upon her she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her and leaves it almost penniless if not friendless at this time too the anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodgedan event which will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest worse than this to them is the fact that dove having somehow been smitten with cold is now dying of consumption suddenly in the midst of their wellborne distress fortune shines upon them from an unknown place this is the cause of itmiss brunel having at length been reduced to her last shilling and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer does so and there and then discovers that she is the daughter and ole heiressofthemarquisotknottingley although for a time quite stunned by the revelation annie brumnel soon masters the situation and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the anerleys but dove is dyingend from death there is no escape and she knows it but she sewe eager to get mrried to will before she d joa to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife for this purpose she gets will to buy a wedding ring and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words we two loving each other very dearly write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife and as a pledge of our constant love this however remains qnsigned and meanwhile dove getting gradually worse desires to see annie brunel whom will finds in her poor lodging attired in a simple black dress for her great secret is still undivulged i was going to me dove she said when i heard she had sent for me butis there an thing the matter     dove is ill he said abruptly  ii cannot tell you but she wants you to come andplay a piece of musio for her  neither of them spoke a word all the way to the house when annie brunel puee and oalm and beautiful went to the girl and took up her white hand and kissed her there was a pleased expression on davsn fae   why didnt they tell me you were ill  she said  i should have been here before  i know that said dove in a whisper forfor you have always been kind to me but you have come in timebut i am too weak to t4h youask willthe betrothal  the brief explanation was speedily given and then dove said  i am very tired will you go into the next room and play me the goulin  and when you come back   she went to doves piano and found there the air which she knew mo well and as she played it so softly that it sounded like some bibisr sd leavetaking that the sea had heard and murmured over dove lay and listened with a strange look on herface wills hand was in hers and she drew him down to her and whisperedi could have been so happy with you will so very happy i think but i

her line hair still drenched xvith the xvater we told her xve came as friends and begged to know how we could serve her  she said her father had sold her at sixteen in the kings bench to a fellowprisoner after having given her a ladys education xvhich her language and manners confirmed  that she was at present to use their absurd tenn under the jirotection of an officer of the guards to whom she xvas strongly attached  that she had lately found he neglected her that he had gone the night before to the masquerade without her  that suspecting this she had followed him that she had seen

correspondence of the late bobtti southey 8c sfc vol ii  second notice it was mentioned at the close of our last notice  that southey took up his abode at kenrick early in 1803 this step was decided in patt  by the bad timeswhich induced mr long man to postpone the scheme of a bibliotheca i britannica a work projected to be superintended i by southey and which would have rendered his residence near london indispensable there i is a sort of comfort in turning back to the conj temptation of straits through which england hu i passed  and therefore we will give a glance towards the complaints

uponrich but not too cumbrous simple but never meagre the next item in this cento of miscellaneous extract refers to far different topicsbeing the commencement of a letter to coleridge characteristic both of its writer and of the friend addressed  i am not sorry that you gave godwin a dressing and should not be sorry if he were occasionally to remember it with the comfortable reflection  in vino veritas for in plain truth already it does vex me to see you so lavish of the outward and visible signs of friendship and to know that a set of fellows whom you do not care for and ought not to care for boast everywhere of your intimacy and with good reason to the best of their understanding you have accustomed yourself to talk affectionately and write affectionately to your friends till the expressions of affection flow by habit in your conversation and in your letters and pass for more than they are worth the worst of all this is that your letters will one day rise up in judgement against you for be sure that hundreds which you have forgotten are hoarded up for some curl or philips of the next generation and you will be convicted of a double dealing which though you do not design you certainly do practise and now that i am writing affectionately more meo i will let out a little more you say in yours to sara that you love and honour me upon my soul i believe you  but if i did not thoroughly believe it before your saying so is the thing of all things that would make me open my eyes and look about me to see if i were not deceived perhaps i am too intolerant to these kind of phrases but indeed when they are true they may be excused and when they are not there is no excuse for them   your feelings go nakedi cover mine with a bearskin i will not say that you harden yours by your mode but i am sure that mine are the warmer for their clothing  it is possible or probable that i err as much as you in an opposite extreme and may make enemies where you would make friends but there is a danger that you may sometimes excite dislike in persons of whose approbation you would yourself be desirous you know me well enough to know in what temper this has been written and to know that it has been some exertion  for the same habit which makes me prefer sitting silent to offering contradiction makes me often withhold censure when perhaps in strictness of moral duty it ought to be applied the medicine might have been sweetened perhaps  but dear coleridge take the simple bitters and leave the sweetmeats by themselves then comes the passage abusing the author of  st leon referred to in our last succeeded by this hearty little codicil  i am never ashamed of letting out my dislikes however and what is a good thing never afraid so let him abuse me and we ll be at war not less hearty than the above outpouring of a tiny phial of gall is the following outbreak of delight in which every bookcollector will join cordially  you would rejoice with me were you now at keswick at the tidings that a box of books is safely harboured in the mersey so that for the next fortnight i shall be more interested in the news of fletcher than of bonaparte it contains some duplicates of the lost cargo among them the collection of thc oldest spanish poems in which is a metrical romance upon the cid i shall sometimes want you for a gothic etymology talk of the happiness of getting a great prize in the lottery  what is that to the opening a box of books the joy upon lilting up the cover must be something like what we shall feel when peter the porter opens the door upstairs and says please to walk in sir that i shall never be paid for my labour according to the current value of time and labour is tolerably certain  but if any one should ofter me 100007 to forego that labour i should bid him and his money go to the devil for twice the sum could not purchase me half the enjoyment it will be a great delight to me in the next world to take a fly and visit these old worthies who are my only society here and to tell them what excellent company i found them here at the lakes 01 cumberland two centuries after they had been dead and turned to dust in plain truth i exist more among the dead than the living and think more about them and perhaps feel more about them we shall conclude the present notice with glances at metropolitan society the following was written by southey after returning from a visit to london in the year 1804the person addressed being coleridge  i was worn to the very bone by fatigue in londonmore walking in one day than i usually take in a month more waste of breath in talking than serves for three monthsconsumption in the country add to this a most abominable cold affecting chest head eyes and nose it was impossible to see hah the persons whom i wished to see and ought to have seen without prolonging my stay to an inconvenient time and an unreasonable length of absence from home   i went into the exhibition merely to see your picture which perfectly provoked me hazlitts does look as if you were on your trial and certainly had stolen the horse but then you did it cleverlyit had been a deep welllaid scheme and it was no fault of yours that you had been detected but this portrait by northcote looks like a grinning idiot and the worst is that it is just like enough to pass for a good likeness with those who only know your features imperfectly dances drawing has that merit at least that nobody would ever suspect you of having been the original   i dined with sotheby and met there henley a man every way to my taste sotheby was very civil and as his civility has not that smoothness so common among the vagabonds of fashion i took it in good part he is what i should call a clever man other lions were price the picturesque man and davies giddy whose face ought to be perpetuated in marble for the honour of mathematics such a forehead i never saw i also met drat dinner who after a long silence broke out into a discourse upon the properties or the conjunction quain except his quamical knowledge which is us profound as you will imagine he knows nothing but bibliography or the science 01 titlepnges impresses and dates it was a relief to leave him and find his brother the captainat rickmans smoking after supper and letting out puffs at the one corner of his mouth and puns at the other the captain

of mark belonging to modern athens ap 1805  elmsley will have told you of our adventures in scotland if the nonadventures of a journey in great britain at this age of the world can deserve that name i am returned with much pleasant matter of remembrance well pleased with walter scottt with johnny armstrongs castle on the esk with pleasant tiviotdale with the tweed nnd the yarrow astonished at edinburgh delighted with melrose sick of presbyterianism and above all things thankful that i am an englishman and not a scotchman the edinburgh reviewers i like well as companions and think little of as anything else elmsley has more knowledge and a sounder mind than any or allof them i could learn more from him in a day than they could all teach me in a year therefore i saw them to disadvantage inasmuch as i had better company at home and in plain english living as i have done and by gods blessing still continue to do in habits of intimate intercourse with such men as rickman wm taylor wordsworth and coleridge the scotchmen did certainly appear to mc very pigmieslieratuli   my trip to edinburgh was pleasant i went to accompany elmsley we staid three days with walter scott at

salmonspearing on the tweed in which though i struck nt no fish i bore my part and managed one end of the boat with a long spear it subsequently appears that mr jeffreys review of  madoc was displeasing to the author of the epic  who permitted himselfafter the fasluon of the ettrick shepherd when talking of  huz teviotdale poetsto write of himself as a poet in one and the same paragraph with  homer shakspeae and miltonand who promised mr richman  that he would like madoc better if ever he read it again scotts lay was  fillipped off in a much more summary and patronising fashion  i have read scotts poem this evening nnd like it much it has the fault of mixed language which you mentioned nnd which i expected and it has the same obscurity or to speak more accurately the same want of perspicuousness ns his glenfinlas i suspect that scott did not wric poetry enough when u boy for he has little command of language his vocabulary ofthe obsolete is ample but in general his words march up stiffly like halftrained recruits neither a natural walk nor a measured march which practice has made natural but 1 like his poem for it is poetry and in a company of strangers i would not mention that it had any faults the beginning of the story is too like coleridges christoboll which he had seen thc very line jesu maria shield her well is caught from it when you see the christobell you will not doubt that scott has imitated it i do not think designedly but the echo was in his ear not for emulation but propter amorem it remains to be seen whether thc icaria lieview of anno cuhct

B810,"['8810960', '3170192', '8941391']",   irish idylls by jane barlow hodder  stoughton the comparison between miss barlow and miss wilkins is a very obvious one for what one is to the humble new englander the other is to the dweller in the bogs of connaught each author reveals to us the life and habit of thought of a class hitherto but little known and eachpossesses the magic of clothing humdrum trifles with interest and charm but as the new englander and the wild irishman differ much from one anothernot only in way of life but in habit of thoughtit follows that the resemblance between the two writers is the result of many differences the new englander is shrewd protestant and struggling the connaught peasant idle dreamy and resigned and as each author has the power of making us live the life of her puppets and enter into their way of thought it follows that anything like imitation is impossible the irish idylls all occur in the desolate hamlet of lisconnel among cottars huddled together on a low hill or knockaun in the bog in a destitution never far removed from actual starvation  the hopes and cares of the inhabitants centre mainly in the little greydyked fields which make a plaid pattern on the hillside and along a meagre belt beneath and this renders it the more regretable that their most prolific and certain crop should be such an unremunerative one stones upon stones scattered broadcast by some malignant hundredhanded and perennially working up through the thin soil in mockery of tenfingered attempts to collect and keep them under those looselybuilt boundary walls which intersect so frequently that the bit of land looks as if a coarselymeshed net had been flung over it fail utterly to exhaust the supply in each diminutive field a

clear of fateful riddles h is bit o land then is dear to the dweller in lisconnel not mainly  i a bit of land but rather as the fragment of solid tangible fact contact with which keeps i his whole

paradise yet it may be at least the site of the only one that can appear possible to him  should a sequel of calamity such as jobs overtake him sweeping away his flocks and herds and children no eventual doubling of his live stock could console him  and as for the ten new sons and daughtersthey would be a failure indeed the working of the irish peasant mind has seldom been indicated more clearly than in this passage and the thoughtful speculative turn of bogland brains reveals itself in a dozen racy conversations which the reader will find only too short though they are too long for quotation in character drawing miss barlow succeeds best with mature women old mrs kilfoyle the widdy mgurk and herself are admirable sketches and mad bell with her face  like a wizened lemon looking shrewdly up at you is a delightful creation but the girls are less living and the menwith perhaps the exception of poor larry sheridanare types rather than individuals like the characters in a modern play but in spite of this defect and of the authors excessive fondness for adjectives the irish idylls are delightful reading and afford a truer insight into irish peasant character and ways of life and thought than any hook that it has been our fortune to read for a long time  irish idylls i imagine that as this book goes the round of the reviews it will become a trite thing to call miss barlow an irish barrie like him she has found her book waiting her in a little and humble place of the earth like him she has the delicate observation that is the harvest of a quiet eye she has his gifts of tenderness of dignity of true and simple pathos of sympathy that comes by love like him she has a fine and beautiful vocabulary and a style that makes pictures to us irish she is more welcome than barrie can be to the scotch we are so long awaiting our real irish novelist while mr barrie comes in the line of succession to great men who have made the world intimate with scotland and scottish folk we have had no such interpreters carleton was too shapeless and too melancholy miss edgeworth despite her genius was oldmaidish and restricted the banims and gryphon did but piecemeal work at best miss lawless in our own day writes of the same sunless country and grey lives that miss barlow treats here but her  grania leaves one an impression of a solitary page of the story a single lonely figure desolate on a low shore amid a waste of waters there is many a lisconnel in ireland at the back of the bogs or  the back of god speed but who else could make of it not a human document but a human book fluttering whose pages we run all the gamut of emotions we have here the human tragedy in such pathetic things as one too many or  herself miss barlow has the gift of tears in verse or prose and as one could scarcely read th old master to take one of her poems without a  irish idylls by jane barlow london hodder and stoughton catch in the throat so it is not easy to be dryeyed over poor larry sheridan and his homely tragedy or over mrs odriscoll and the children going to america but what good honest pathos it is none of the unwholesome things that take you by the throat with a stony horror like those that stalk out of ibsen and the russians irish idylls leaves us more human and kindly when it has wrung our hearts then the humour is truly delightful what a child only we see too little of him is jimmy kilfoyle and what mingled humour and pathos is the warp and woof of all their lives one gets to know them mrs doyne and stacy dear little mrs kilfoyle and mr mcgurk and all the other worthies of lisconnel as if one were going in and out every day among them the humanity is not starved olt of lisconnel it is an innocent little community indeed in which the only thing starved out seems to be vice miss barlow sees not only the primitive lives but the lonely country and the wild skies that seem a part of it she has superb descriptive bits which paint us pictures as finely as any sky painter or painter of moors who works in the legitimate medium i wish i had space to quote the skies that flash into her pictures fixed for us in her nervous and fine english it would not be easy to better this all at once something happened in the western sky it was as if some vast tentrope had suddenly been snapped for the dark riftless cloudcanopy seemed not so much to abruptly rise as to actually recoil back with a swing up from the horizons verge and ere one had realised that it had begun to lift it was flying eastward scudding in festoons and trails and shreds or furled into rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering blasts i believe  irish idylls will be an irish classic i have read every line of it with increasing delight and am glad messrs hodder and stoughton have bound it so substantially not like your mushrooms of a season miss barlow writes a little more from the outside than does barrie this is shown by her occasional slip in the matter of the brogue though she has much mended since  bogland studies another matter in which she does not see far is that in such lives as these religion would be a far more potent element than she makes it katharine tynan  irish ways by jane barlow illus trated by warwick goble allen  sons miss jane barlows reputation as a writer of irish tales or rather irish sketches of character is too high to require any recommendation from us this new instalment has all the merits of her previous volumes but it does not manifest any advance in her art the style is finished and shows evidence of high education and long familiarity with classical and modern literature hence it is remarkable that she should confine herself to so narrow a field where that large learning can show itself only indirectly and where a love of nature and an insight into peasant character form the whole matter of the volume there is but little plot in her stories  the elements of broad farce and of wild tragedy are not there but we find endless quiet humour and deep appreciation of the virtues and foibles of one of the most attractive peasantries of europe the opening chapter  ourselves and our island gives a summary of the complexities of irish character very similar to the larger but not so subtle treatment by mr lynd which we noticed on october 23rd but when we penetrate into the book we find that two or three leading types which other books treat at great length are ignored by miss barlow we say ignored for it is inconceivable that she does not know them the first is the roman catholic priest and indeed the protestant clergyman whose influence on the life of the poor is so great yet so disputed there is occasionally a priest in her backgrounds but as a character she will not tolerate him the same is the case with the local agitator and thirdly there is the gombeen man local moneylender who haunts every village and every market in poorer ireland and gives ample scope to the painter of irish life as for example to william carleton yet though this is the author who has most in common with miss barlow she omits these three types as carefully as the letters upon ireland are omitted from the published correspondence of queen victoria we can offer no clue to this negative feature in miss barlows irish stories but we must say that it limits her field and makes her gallery of local types smaller and more monotonous if she also omits the jackeen and the buckeen the apes of the squireen she would doubtless reply that she writes only about the very poor and only about the country poor who have exceptional manners no one knows better than miss barlow how to bring out this feature in her tales  and she paints the life and feelings of these indigent but refined peasants with a charm that has fascinated the reading public of our day her descriptions of the scenery of bogs and moors and of wild western coasts is often truly poetical indeed she allows herself the licence of french rather than english prose in this respect the beauties of bogland are by no means obvious yet no man who has travelled that sort of country deliberately as for example for sport will hesitate to acknowledge the truth and accuracy of her observation the writing down of dialect is always difficult some eminent irish novelists are very deficient in the power of hearing the sounds and catching the idioms such is not the case with miss barlow though we are not always in agreement with her we make the following suggestions as she surely professes to give the ordinary diction of western peasants and not their occasional use of strange words though the eastern irish speak of an awkward person as a thwart we do not remember the verb  to thwart in their use or with like limitation the verb  to question the irishman does not say  i question whether this is true but i doubt if it is so to be surprised  is also unusual though  surprizin  is common  and the pronunciation  scandeelious  for  scandlous  is new to us the irish know a spruce tree well enough but a spruce lad is a use of the adjective which is surely uncommon  should you suppose is also to be rejected  shall  and  should  being very unusual and replaced by  will  and  would the general impression which the english will draw from the book is that the western irish peasant is not the gay rollicking careless figure of angloirish fiction but rather a patient hardworking creature living in such squalor and gloom as to make his life a prolonged effort against despair miss barlows peasants represent the preceltic population often called firbolgs which was subdued by the invading celts and either exiled to the mountains and bogs of the west or reduced to the condition of churls who tilled the land for the tyrannous and ungrateful celtic swordsmen and their chiefs the hard treatment which the latter received from the english was probably a mere repetition of what had happened ten or fifteen centuries earlier when the celts were the invading conquerors it would be an interesting inquiry to trace the influences of this earlier stratum  probably pre  aryan  on the life of ireland but these are speculations regarding remote and forgotten causes which have drawn us away from the living pictures of today which are the object of this book we need hardly say in conclusion that we commend it strongly to our readers a word of praise should be added for the excellent illustrations of mr goble,history_contra

city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr

cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet novel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to

us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the

originally published in french some five years ago showed how much he could teach us about our own literature his researches are now presented to us in a revised and enlarged shape and the result is a contribution of permanent value to the history of elizabethan literature m jusserand has chosen ground that we ourselves have neglected but his explorations have not been superficial and we are inclined to think that future travellers in the same country will find little new information to supply and few erroneous impressions to correct with thoroughness as an investigator m jusserand combines a faculty of placing his results attractively before his readers and he has been fortunate in securing the assistance of miss elizabeth lee who has done her work of translation satisfactorily throughout miss lees english is always accurate and when it suggests a french idiom we appreciate the scholarly flavour of the rendering the book abounds in pertinent illustrations william rogerss faithful engraving of queen elizabeths portrait forms the frontispiece a view of burghley house exemplifies the richness of elizabethan architecture with which contemporary literature had much in common portraits of sir philip sidney and his sister wellselected plates from such works of imagination as topsoils  fourfooted beastes and  serpents examples of the illustrations employed in french seventeenth century romances all give a charm to the volume which the scholar will appreciate no less than the general reader the useful index deserves a word of praise m jusserand traces the sources of the novel even before the remote date of beowulf but he wisely avoids merely archaeological speculation and begins a detailed treatment of his subject with sir thomas malorys  morte darthur as everybody is aware caxton was the printer of this noble and joyous book but it is less generally known that this was only one of caxtons efforts as printer editor or translator to gratify his patrons insatiable taste for works of fiction the new forms of literature and the new lines of thought which the renaissance introduced seemed to stimulate rather than to check the demand for chivalric romances which had grown steadily through the middle ages as we watch in m jusserands pages the development of the novel from caxtons translations through lord bernerss unwieldy romances to the works of fiction produced by shakespeares contemporaries lyly and greene we are deeply impressed by the permanence of mediaeval influences the early elizabethan writers of romances assimilated much renaissance sentiment but it is not until wo reach nashs studies in real life at the close of the sixteenth century that the medico val leaven is superseded lyly with his wealth of illustration drawn from the scientific speculations of the middle ages and his fanciful descriptions of athens or naples and greene with his stories of knights and kings and courts of chivalry look like lineal descendants of the jongleurs of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they reflect the past and despite m jusserands ingenious and luminous suggestions to the contrary only occasionally foreshadow the future but m jusserand has invested his accounts of lylys work and of that of lylys successors with so much fresh and appreciative comment that it will be impossible hereafter to refuse to these survivals a literary any less than an historical interest lylys hero euphues becomes an attractive figure in the skilful hands of m jusserand but euphuess undoubted affinity at some points to richardsons heroes does not convince us quite so readily as m jusserand is convinced that he is in any literal sense  the ancestor in direct line of grandison  or of lord orville the theory at any rate needs further testing of sidney and pastoral romance of thomas nash and the picaresque novel and of english fiction in the seventeenth century m jusserand treats with far more judgement and knowledge than any of our own countrymen have devoted to the subjects m jusserand is able at times to render his criticism and information more effective by drawing upon his knowledge of french literature for illustrative comments sir thomas malorys sole mention of himself or of his personal opinions throughout his monumental epic is in a short chapter in which he laments the decay in his day of virtuous love m jusserand well contrasts the cold seriousness characteristic of the english romancewriter with the impetuous warmth of the author of aucassin and nicolette the relations between early english and french literature have never been fully investigated and the fact that french translations of greenes romances and of sidneys  arcadia became while elizabeth was still queen almost as popular in paris as the originals were in london will be news for many wellinformed students of our literary history some of them may not be more familiar with the circumstance that the debts which french readers of romance contracted to english authors in the sixteenth century were amply repaid in the seventeenth century when english lovers of fiction satiated themselves with the interminable romances of scud cry or la calprenede in english versions these international amenities which have been much neglected by literary historians are worth dwelling on and in the elaborate history of english literature on which it is generally understood m jusserand has long been engaged we may fairly anticipate to find them fully discussed the points of interest about this book are so numerous

ever faithful and constant lover s g william i1uwitt wvbo resided for some years in germany notices the similarity between an old german custom and an old english one the observance of mothering sun aand it suggests some reflections in which we cordially sympathize mt1t11frm sunday it was called mothering sunday because says brand while the ronian church wis thie establishied religtion it was the custom to visit their mother church on kidlent sunday and make their offerings on the high altar so ancient and deep was this feeling that the epistle for that day which alluded to jerusalem mater onsinumjerusalem the mother of us allgalatians iv 21 is still retained by the english church though the occasion is forgotten this feeling of the beautiful maternal relation descended from the church to domestic life and it became the custom for all servants and apprentices on this day to be allowed to visit their mothers and carry with themr some little presents they were reecivel with a rural feast in keeping with the old customs of the day beans in the progressive refinement of living had given way to peas andl peas to boiled corn and therefore the entertainweut of todiay was a dish of excellent furmety why should this beautiful custom have died out with the mass of rubbish which encumbered or defaced the popular festivals of past times why should it not be revived and made a holiday of the heart why should not every family on this day still unite and expect those of its children that are gone out into the world as servants or apprenticesat least such as are near enough to avail themselves of such a privilegeand make it a day of family reunion and affectionate enjoyment why should not the young still be anxious as we are told they used to be in different parts of england  to visit their parents and make them a present of moneey a trinket or some nice eatable and why should not thc ancient dislh of excellent furmety be set to welcome them on the table there is something so beautiful ill this custom that we know of no holiday that can in this respect compare to it the principle embraces all that is lovely andt endearingall that is purifying and strengtlening

fancied she could hear the cries of distress the husband listened but could perceive nothing but the raging of the storm and the thundering of the billows upon the shore he therefore urged his wife to sleep again treating it merely as the excitement of a frightful dream the wife who had in vain urged her husband to take his boat to ascertain at all events whether a wreck really were in the

the wreck appeared to lie and the miserably perishing state of the few survivors whose cries still seemed to ring in her cars tlhe husband who had no inclination to brave all the horrors of this stormy night in his boat merely on the strength of his wifes dream positively refused aed treated it all as a mere fancy caused by the tumult of the storm the wife on the contrary on whose mind the dream had made the impression of absolute truth and who was a woman of great resolution and courage and who was quite conlretent to thle management of a boatas many of these fishermens wifes aredetermined to go out by herself to rescue these unfortunate wretches who she was convinced stood in such need of help the man however either shanmed by her courage or unwilling that she should peril herself alone in suchl a hazardous attempt and finding every effort to alter her purpose vain consented to accompany her the boat therefore was launched she directing according to her dream the course which they should steer before long they discovered that the dream really was true at the point where she had stated lay the wreck with several human beings fastened upon itas far as i call

gallienne the titles are the star worshipper the elusive melody the mandrake venus the futile quest  the kingdom of dreams and  the well of truth george egertons fantasias do not appreciably differ from the allegories of other writers except that her satire is more bitter john lane 156 pp 3s 6d  fantasias by george egerton lane i   jll j11 1  h george egerton is irredeemably dull when she attempts allegory chiefly because she does not in the least understand how the thing should be done an allegory which starts with pilgrims or vague arcadian characters with illdefined habitations should not launch out into allusions to county councils or popular newspapers or great critics or the state regulation of vice  the whole point of an allegory is thereby lost which is from personalities or places drawn from au imaginary world to extract lessons for actual circumstances or else by a representation of an ideal world to suggest a picture of reality but suddenly to interrupt the imaginary picture by an allusion to crude realities is like gumming real flies on to a picture to make it look lifelike there is a certain amount of satire intended in the pictures produced in fantasias but it is not very biting in a word it is the dullest book yet produced by an author who is not very amusing at her best a departure from tradition and other stories by rosaline masson bliss sands  co is a pleasant volume it consists of two comparatively long stories and six of shorter dimensions  one of the six is selected to give the title to the volume the best story in the book is that entitled  a moulted feather which might be better described as  passages in the history of a family of no importance not only is the story well told but it shows genuine pathos and literary capacity the whole of the book is carefully written and it should find favour with those who wish to vary the reading of singlevolume novels by dipping into volumes of collected stories the writer is one whose work should have attractions for the magazine editor of the day hagar of the pawnshop by fergus hume skeffington  son consists of a series of stories strung on a slender thread hagar is a lady of gypsy birth who is compelled by circumstances to take charge of a pawnshop in london  and the writer constructs a set of stories mostly dependent on crime or cupidity for their interest associated with her customers these stories are well told and are decidedly readable though in less skilful hands they would possess very slight elements of interest fergus humes readers may be interested to know that the italian renaissance is described as a wild and contradictory time that the word otherwhere  is to be found in these pages  and that a second edition of the  divina commedia was printed and published in florence in the fourteenth century it is not surprising to learn that this edition is extremely rare and worth much money  fantasias by george egerton 3s 6d lane whatever was bold or naughty in 1 keynotes and its successors has vanished and in its place we see nothing but insignificance the sketches in george egertons latest book are mild and dull allegories such as young persons of much vague sentiment and little knowledge of life find their easiest expression in the gospel behind being that of the pioneer club somewhat weakened the symbolism is not always very successful the woman with an inordinate love of porridge standing for the philistine and the huntsman who hunted butterflies on horseback for don juan are unhappily chosen we think there is less extravagance of language than formerly but we come across such doubtful phrases as  eyes filled with luminous speering and inborn sadness is  speering  english or scots either way it is misspelt her old habit of coining words is not yet successful 1 advertisive is surely a bad shot and what is one to say of anyone who pretends to style and makes use of the vulgarism  common or garden   as for the matter of it all it is old and trite and truethe loneliness of genius the grossness of the world the love of lying great themes but feeble sentimental grumblings will not wake us up anew to the truth of the charge and the pity of it  fantasias reviews by  george egerton john lane by fantasias  george egerton  means very much the same thing that olive schreiner meant by breamsshort moral stories wherein the characters are not men and women but types of men and women or personifications of abstract qualities the new prac titioner of the art of allegory takes however more liberty than her predecessor she would not only teach but chastise also the satire is bludgeonly and  george egerton mingles real and ideal until we are disconcerted by bizarre effects  for her method she seems to have gone to hans andersen bunyan and thackeray  the well of truth  has this passage  no one is in society who does tell the truth added the governess who was a privileged person mendacity is the essential oil of the social machinery  you need not be a liar my dear said the family friend who was in the foreign office  because you have acquired the tongue of well bred society it only needs

called fantasias might at any rate be free from smart lady journalists as for the thought contained in these allegories it is not new and not particularly subtle but such asone might expect from a

drunkards perhaps find it not very easy to understand how mr matthew arnold came to write a sonnet to the artist the bottle is scarcely a work of art it has indeed a central interest but that interest is a moral purpose and no one can say that the picture of the crowds of boozy and bulbous figures is one that gives pleasure to the spectator  say what shall calm us when such guests intrude like comets on the heavenly solitude   asks the poet and the reviewer may be allowed to say that mr jenkins story the devils chain on which he has no intention of writing a sonnet is more a moral comet of the bottle sort than a work of art indeed mr jenkins admits that he has not tried to write a pleasing work of fiction his aim is  to exhibit in rude stern truthful outlines the full features of the abuses he would humbly help to remove the abuses are those that spring from the traffic of drink  mr jenkins finds men dining comfortably and voting steadily in utter disregard of their fell disastrous and diabolical effects he  cannot acquit himself of having too long done the like one hopes that mr jenkins will continue to vote with his wonted steadiness  it would not however be easy for a sensitive person to dine comfortably immediately after reading his devils chain the devil8 chain is a tissue of horrors the first link shows us a woman of bad character and of about fortyfour years of age entertaining a secretary of state and a young gentleman who had left balliol at the age of nineteen after a distinguished career with brandy sherry and champagne this is bad enough but the secretary had scarcely time to tell his precocious friend that their hostess was a mrs hurlingham sister of their acquaintance captain conistoun when she leapt out of the window and fell dead at the feet of her husband who was staggering past in the last stage of drunkenness but one on beholding this spectacle miss lucy merton a virtuous grisette fainted and was entertained by a young man a total stranger with the refreshment of hot brandy and water an unpleasant episode follows about which we shall merely say that the christian name of the total stranger is singularly illchosen meantime the secretary of state had wrapped himself up in a large cloak which he wore for purposes of disguise when pursuing his nefarious pleasures and had retired with the balliol man from the disastrous scene mr jenkins may have borrowed the cloak from pericles prince of tyre act iv scene 6  here comes the lord lysimachus disguised a coroners inquest was held on the dead woman and mr jenkins points out with very great force and truth the wretched results of the unseemly habit of holding coroners inquests in public houses at the inquest the drunken husband is brought forward and a letter is read which had been addressed to him by his deceased wife why did she call him henry when his name was lucius why did mrs merton p 167 call her husband john when his name p 155 was william  or do people change their names when they take to drink joseph cray becoming john cray in part of the narrativeas they do when they enter religion  but mr jenkins has not aimed at artistic results the coroner elicits the facts that lucius or henry hurlingham was a man of family and wealth that his wife took to brandy and other sins that he had followed her example till he sank with a life of gindrinking

alcohol in moments of exhaustion cannot too often be preached it may even be allowed that fic tion is a good medium for morality but one fails to see how the heaping up of so many thickcoming horrors

that are spread over the whole history of the villein and in temperancetales we look for the horrors of a year crushed into a few weeks and we are not disappointed mr jenkins does not attempt to prescribe the purge for the evils he catalogues and it is not likely that his book will arouse any one to the sense of these evils who was not alive to them before it is a shameful thing that the trade in liquor should be  forced  by advertisements and by public houses started by distillers it is a wretched thing that society should be based on forms of labour which disfigure the body and that

romance to go upon with a mystery to hunt out and unravel by way of occupation for three goodly and wellfilled volumes the english is good and the style in which it is written proves the author to be a scholar and a gentleman but the novel that is the result of all these good materials is not entertaining on the contrary it is decidedly dry we are very sorry to say it but we have read stories without a tenta of the virtues which we have ascribed to mr t a trollope not only readable but decidedly interesting and compelling the reader in spite of all the protests from his common sense to read them straight through to the end and to confess with some shame after closing the last volume that it might be great rubbish but that he could not sut it down until he knew how it all ended tow no reader will venture to call artingale castle rubbish but we question whether any reader will feel the least anxiety to know the end or will be unable to lay down the book at any page or period when he ought to go about other business artingale castle is not as a novel well constructed there are so many false starts before the main story fairly begins that the reader is disappointed and fatigued and his interest is languid the third page gives great hopes of what is to come there are two cuttings from an old newspaper one announcing the approaching marriage in fashionable life of sir george artingale to lady georgiana tarla tane the other advertising the sailing of the good ship mary thornton  for boston in the colony of massachusetts north america the connexion between these two pieces of intelligence is made clear by the interview of the family lawyer mr harding with the beautiful scotchwoman who claims to be sir george artingales lawful wife but whom that gentleman entirely disowns confessing he had imposed upon her by a fraudulent marriage as t she has no means of proving her own case or of disproving his assertion she meekly accepts her position and an allowance of two hundred a year for the sake of her child both of them sail for boston in the mary thornton and are heard of no more the family lawyer mr harding entertains his own suspicions and writes a letter to the baronet his client which comes to light on a future dav and proves where a mystery has been hidden which on further search reveals itself sir george dies and is buried his wife the lady georgiana dies and is buried and their son sir hildebrand reigns in their stead he has a beautiful sister named agnes who is the heroine of an episode that leads to nothing except to prove the great family pride both of miss agnes artingale and of her brother sir hildebrand all these are preliminary to the story sir hildebrand has to marry and to have an only daughter and the daughter has to grow up fair and blooming before the tale can be said to he fairly afloat by this time the reader is pretty well fatigued by so many beginnings besides all this artingale castle itself has fallen into disrepair and the reigning baronet wishes much to rebuild it but the wicked sir george has so impoverished the family estates that there is no prospect of keeping the roof over the venerable old castle there is however a certain friend and neighbour mr farland of farlandstoke who has an only son felix by namealso much money and he and sir hildebrand agree that the young people are to marry and mr farland is to build up oastle artingale the arrangement looks promising mr felix is an excellent young man miss mary artingale is a charming heiress with all the traditions of family pride carefully instilled into her neither of them has any great objection to the other but neither of them is disposed to love or marry the other matters go on calmly an architect is brought to consider plans and estimates he is to give miss mary drawinglessons and they fall in love the vicar has a pretty and piquante daughter and mr felix finds her pleasanter than miss mary there arrives a fine young american sailor introduced by a retired seacaptain he bears a strange resemblance to sir hildebrand gradually the mystery grows and the old secret comes to light the missing links are ferreted up by a sharp young attorney and the result is what all readers will anticipate the alleged false marriage of sir george was a valid one the handsome american sailor is the lawful heir and poor sir hildebrand is illegitimate a fact which pains him more than having to give up artingale castle much happiness to others comes incidentally from this setting right an old wrong we do not think the young american behaved too generously to sir hildebrand but all the young people are married to their hearts content miss mary who as her fathers heiress could not have marriedher drawingmasterfinds

B3011,"['2445682', '3174747', '6856828']",  a daughter of the morning by hugh de selincourt chatto and windus 6s in spite of inequalities and a certain rather annoying way of twisting all events to his theories mr de selincourt has produced an acutely alive piece of work to which his somewhat farfetched title gives little clue the theme is the old old one of love versus convention but even more than in the vivid manner of its treatment the success of the book lies in the character drawing which is a real achievement the only people who do not ring true are smith the gardener his extraordinarily broadminded wife and the servant girl lucy whom he loves but constance howard the pleasantfaced young woman of twentyeight who never in all her prosperous life has been startled into thought until she comes on smith and lucy passionately kissing her mother that gentle humorous lady and james the young painter cousin who sleeps out of doors in a bag airing his head and his theories are all in the picture though we confess to agreeing with constance when she feels that she can never really like james but the triumph of the book is reginald trew the middleaged and married art critic and he is such a triumph that were there nothing else good in the book he would justify it trews affair with the awakened constance the way he makes literary love to her his longing to take all she offers and his cowardly withdrawal at the last in the relation of these things as in the description of constances survival of her pain mr de selincourt has achieved much and most of all does he succeed in the letter which TRUE writes to constance when he fails her youd have made me a different man if id been ten years younger and circumstances had been kinder writes trew the child of circumstances youd have put spirit in me shes taken the spirit out of me it was my luck to meet her too soon and to meet you too late    everyone likes me people beam when they see me    ive a sweet nature and a gentle voice i cant help saying the sympathetic thing oh if vou knew how i loathe myself    i am trying to tell you the truth i dont know the truth i can only curse fate you would have made me a man   youth has gone manhood has not come im to be pitied that is his cry to the last as it always is to a man of his type impressionable yet shallow affectionate yet incapable of understanding the wounds he deals to those for whom he professes affection and through it all till vision of him becomes too clear how lovable  it is the presentment of reginald TRUE that makes of a daughter of the morning a book to be read  a daughter of the morning by hugh de selin court 6s chatto  windus constance howard a young lady of some twentyfive summers awoke one morning unusually early and was annoyed to find that she could not go to sleep again she was at a loss to know how to occupy the time before breakfast she had a horror of thinking about such elementary questions as her own life and her own body such matters were considered morbid in her respectable household and constance distrusted  morbidness eventually she jumped out of bed and gazed out of her window and then fell on her knees to pray that she might be made d a daughter of the morning she was not quite sure what she meant by the phrase but it remained in her mind constances prayer is answered and the steps of her development are cunningly portrayed by means of two threads in the story smith the gardener in constances home has an invalid wife who is so devoted to her husband that his happiness is her only joy hence an illicit connexion with lucy constances maid merely causes the good lady gratefully to sing her  nunc dimiltis before constance could gain spiritual insight however it was necessary for her to fall in love with a man who was already married and who only withdrew from an alliance on the ground that if one lives in the world one must conform to its standards it was impossible for the story as conceived by the author to proceed on anything but unpleasant lines and we are sorry that his great gifts should not have been displayed to better advantage  a daughter of the morning fiction by hugh de selincourt chatto and windus 6s was it mere coincidence that after reading mr de s61incourts latest book a certain poem which begins  by this he knew she wept with waking eyes haunted us with its sad solemn organtones we find in a daughter of the morning despite its charm of writing and its pages of thoughtful and amusing dialogue little but sadness one would imagine that instead of being a practised author and a competent critic mr de s61incourt was one of the crowd anxious to shock the sensibilities keen on finding a fresh situation of the weariful  problem  description he has undoubtedly found it here but frankly it is unpleasanta mans mistress welcomed by his invalid wife for the sake of the possible child and no amount of draping with roses will make it less so this is a pity after the delightful promise of  a fair house and it is not the only shadow on the book that a woman so strictly and innocently brought up as was constance to the age of twentyeight should suddenly undergo a smart volteface and virtually not virtuouslyask another womans husband to visit her is quite incredible he failed her at the last having reserves of strength which she did not suspect he was  a coward and this constituted her trial  the knowledge seared and burnt her somehow the sense of proportion is lacking from this novel and we are doubly sorry for there are memorable pages and some perfectly delightful characters and certain metaphors and sentences that mark mr de selincourt as of the tribe of henry james perhaps in his next work he will hark back from  modern love  to  love in the valley and recapture the magic spell,history_contra

are of a more quaint and feminine order than those of the oriental tourist miss bunbury exhibits herself as bustling curious sentimental resolute to see and not averse to be seenin a manner calculated to suggest whimsical thoughts of the impression which her solitary appearance must have produced in circles wherein the travelled englishwoman is a rarity our authoress appears avowedly to have announced herself as travelling with a view to publication and to have got on in a fashion sufficiently unique let us take an instance at randomwhile waiting in christiania for an j eclipse it occurred to miss bunbury that she  would improve the interval by taking a run into the country never having learned to drive j herself in a carriole and feeling that a solitary expedition in a strange land of which she could not speak the language might be unsafe as well as conspicuousshe met willingly a proposition made by those whom she consulted that she should hire a divinity student on the point of taking orders to drive her and to keep her company the narrative shall be continued in her own words the tomorrow came i could scarcely sleep from excitement however having my travels before me i tried to make a good breakfast every book of travels in the north i had read asserted that in these regions one might always calculate on good eggs so eggs i always have ordered hitherto in the

have a tree passage and will attend you then i must go on the road to bergen very well it is the most  beautiful road i will go for him now and return  in half an hourwhat easy resources they have i here  i said to myself in three or four hours the i professor returned i should have come sooner i he said but the lieutenant has now promised to i accompany a blind man who has come to see our country and a promise to a blind man you know must be kept before one to a lady  perhaps  yesbefore one to a lady who has eyes but no matter i have another plan much more suited to you yes this you will say is the very thing see now one of our fairylegend writers is going to make a tour a tour in fairyland  i interrupted clasping my hands and feeling myself wafted back to the jar far distant years of my blessed childhood  j  and i shall share it yes he will drive and if  you wish to draw draw what the carriole  j  ack nay he is going to collect fairylegends  and if you wish towhat do you

oh  dear no government would pay me for mine  we have no governmenttrain to fairyland but you must wait till tomorrow said the professor    the professor had told me that the fairylegend   hunter spoke english a delightful knowledge this   was to me for i am by no means strong in northern i tongues thus in the hope of using and hearing my  own i was quite at ease when the next day they both j made their appearance the professor presented  i me formally herr fairyhunter made a great many   bows and as so many bows involve a good many s i curtsies i inclined nearly as often then with a last  j reverence he spoke in english and said very slowly  i complain of you much that you are so dis t agreeable but now i make an extra i made my r i last reverence in reply such a speech by way of a i i complimentary one was rather startling and not a s j little alarming i looked nervously at the professor who with profound gravity interpreted his friends meaning thushe pities you for being so disagreeably circumstanced  but he is making an abridgment of his book and therefore cannot now make his tour i bowed with a sense of relief and the 1 j fairyhunter and myself exchanged some sentences

their affairs here they expect you will pay all the travelling expenses they will bring their own provisions because there are none to be got on the road that is fair  very fair indeed i answered  the

board that boat was a poor little frenchwoman the wife of a professor of paris without any sort of cloak or defence against it i gave her part of mine and made her put her feet at the open door of the

only occasionally diversified by the appearance of such fine places as skokloster and if such be the case at all times it may be supposed what it was on a dark rainy and bitterly cold day we landed however and got to an hotel and were given an immense room with a couple of sofas in it which at night were opened and the treasures they contained were taken out anti laid upon them and so your sofa is turned into your bed and your sittingroom into your steeping room with very little ado and the evening was so wet that i stayed in the house and tried to persuade myself i was in upsala   when i went out of the hotel on a sunshiny morning i went about and about and said where is upsala and my companion said  you are in it and i answered no i am in a clean modern goodlooking town of new wooden houses painted or coloured in all colours chiefly red the streets are wide very wide indeed and the whole thing looks as if it had sprung up in a night by the work of a few carpenters hands there is

little adornment which nature herself had bestowed upon my head by wearing the plumes more lavishly bestowed on other creatures without being guilty of usurping the honours of matrimony i felt it necessary to make the most of my natural advantages by calling in the aid of a hairdresser kccolleering having seen a shop of that description kept by a frenchman from paris somewhere about bruukehcrg i thought there was no ditliculty in the way and asking froken to accompany me on a walk i went out intending to make this matter its object the shop proved to he a perfumery ami fancy tttionery one also there was a woman only therein who when i asked for monsieur said she was his wile and supposed she would do as well i replied no for i wanted him to come to dress my hair  not your own hair she said in a solemn and questioning manner certainly my own hairon your headcertainly on my own head can i see him the good woman looked at me with a face that plainly said what an audaciously hardened creature this must be to make such a proposal then abruptly saying  he is absent he is in paris he is very ill in bed she turned her back and looked up at the articles on her shelf i went away on our road i saw a sign with  pcrukmakare upon it and before froken could stop nie i entered the shop there was a man here  is it to make a peruke he inquired  no to come to dress my hair the poor man seemed to undergo a convulsion to avoid laughter then he looked so awkward i think he blushed but i looked out and saw froken standing with a very pretty face of perfect distress in the street madame madame she cried at the door when i appeared that is impossible that we can ask for a hairdresser in stockholm pray madame come home i want to be at home i went home with the poor girl thinking only that it is very unpleasant for any one not interested in an object to go about thus on an unpleasant day looking for what is not easily found a few minutes after we entered the house i followed froken to the salong and found my hostess leaning her back against the kakelugn or stove and laughing most heartily while froken stood before with a halfashamed halfrelieved countenance evidently in the act of confession  yes madame cried the former interrupting her laugh to speak to me and taking it up again yes i am telling her that is not so dangerous and the laugh recommencedwhatto ask for a hairdresser that there was some infection going which such persons were in danger of conveying i was now quite convinced but when i simply asked if this were the case a roar of laughter echoed through the great room it brought out some young ladies to see if what was going on were roliga word i think oftener used in the swedish language than in any other certainly oftener than we use its english expletiveamusing but to see all the modest faces that were put to the blush when they heard that madame had actually been inquiring for a hairdresser  well said the hostess at last it is not wonderful that madame should do so for in my younger days it was not thought improper to employ a man to dress hair improper i cried opening my eyes as a new light dawned on them and that good wifes shocked expression of face reappeared before themimproper why in england where propriety is very much thought of and in france too that is an everyday occurrence1 yes yes that is not dangerous and that i find quite a foolish idea though it is our custom said our hostess for once in her life giving up the perfection and immutability of swedish ways  it was not so in my youth no when i was in the world it was not improper to have a hairdresser the ladies ran away and i asked the elder one in private what it was that constituted this impropriety that is just what i cannot well say she replied but no lady here would have a man to dress her hair they have women who are taught to do so but these women are taught by men yes but man kan inte hjelpe det the fact is it is a ladys propriety but not a womans that is shocked by employing a male hairdresser i remarked it is our custom madame but i grant you i do not think it a wise one for it was not thought dangerous when i was in the world forty years agobut how can it be so now  whyyou know he must go into the ladies apartments yes but men often do so here at all times and sit and talk there with them yes but you know their toilet is not complete when their hair is to be dressedbut propriety is much more outraged when it is complete i answered man kan inte hjelpe det said the noble dame and ran off to the kitchen the above extracts will suffice to give the reader a fairand we think a not unpleasant idea of miss bunburys book she is not so much wanting in good nature ns wanting in taste she possesses the power of observation in larger proportion than the faculty of selection a sledge accident which confined her to the house made her the object of affectionate ministration on the part of miss bremerto whose thoughtful and

then this being the third day of june and mir samuel pepys gone to deptford upon his affairs i lay a page between the folios of the book of requests and begin jtune 3rdthis morning the king walked in the privy garden with the duke and there was very merry declaring that his brother s confessors did nominate his ladyloves to him for a penance they being so plain of their featuresalso old at this the duke tooajl offence and turning on his heel was gone in a huff to the navy office into which he entered like a whirlwind while his brother stood still leaning on his cane and laughing then the kling betook himself to mistress frances stewart with design to pay court to her but she would do nothing but pull cherries from the trees of the royal garden and eat them letting one hang from between her lips by the stalk and calling upon his majesty to declare if lie did not think it desirable then dld she climb a cherrytree with the kings help and being freakish would have him follow to a seat beside her among the branches but this his alajesty refused though smilingly and as one who had it not been for the courtiers would gladly have yielded then came the queen out and so there was an end of the frolic for though her majesty hath need of patience and practises it yet in portugal her country is no jesting wvith such things yet beeause the queen also is fond of mistress stewart and cherishes her for her beauty and simplicity though not boldly witty like our nelly of the kings house there was no anger only the queen did shake her finger at the king and bade him think of his latter end rather than to go climbing trees after scapegrace maids to which the king replied lord madam that was the very thing i was thinking of which all took very well and held to be of a mighty pretty wit it was indeed rare sport to see how little stewart could flout the king and yet keep him more on the edge of himself than castle maine davis gwyn or all the drove of themwithal giving him no satisfaction but only saucy answers and all wvith such a mockery of civility that perforce the king laughed himselfyet methought with a wryish face but afterwards my lord of richmond and the chancellor smiled at her and she at thein so that it was easy to be seen how the three were of a very good intel ligence but the king guessed nothing of it only continued to make eyes at pretty frances till they fairly bulged out of his sallow faceas saith the proverb like the 1101s on a gooseberry fool this mistress frances is used to behave like a child knowin that when she smiles none can find it in their hearts to scoldher face being the most ierfect that ester was seven so much so that the king hath caused his maker of m1eldals john iloettiers to take a medal punching of it in the profile but it is her childishness which wtins upon voui for it is illmpossille to be angry with her she moves quickly like a bird nervous uand light as if ready to dart off in any direction at auy moment though she wears short gowns and those of grey there is always a look about her as of a trolic bird with glossy plumage which ones hand desires to caress but on a sudden lo she escapes from under and is at the end of the corridor laughing and twitter ing and looking back like a thing that always perched upon twigs so at least says the duke and i believe him and so much for mistress frances this day we saw not much of his grace for instead of abiding in the navy office he merely walked a little to and fro stamping his foot and so returned back as he came for this all in the garden wvere heartily sorry for it only made little stewart the more mirthful so that she kneeled anid denianded of the duke of york his fatherly blessing meaning thereby that the story which the lord brunker had told was truenamely that lie was a jesuit still it is a pity to see great men so used in public and the king himself looking on and laughing this doth not make the country respected but the contrary for all the while the french ambassador wvas writing in his tablets and i doubt not all goes to lewis as fast as spur and sail can drive it but after all was done and the king and duke retired once more mistress frances laid aside her spritely manners to talk with the chancellor and my lord richmond very gravely there was none to overlook and mistress stewart did give a hand to each as though mnaking some promise and even the stiff old chancellor set his lips to that which he held while as for my lord richmond he kissed his finger by finger like an holy relic it was by virtue of her maid who is of the country of wales having come hither with miss price that we get us news of the court at first hand of course being my lord dukes servants iv hear much of which i do not speak but what little ann hughes doth prate i think it no shame to tell for if i do not my master will and it is a pleasure to forestall him besides hughes being of the welsh folk doth most merrily invent there is no fear in her being miss frances stewarts favourite woman yet do i believe that for honesty there is none in the court like mistress stewart except only miss jennings who is so for interest and m1iss hobart bv nature and inclination the queen is also well advised of this and tis said little frances doth carry all her sweethearting letters to her majesty to laugh overwhich for a child such as she appears to be is very well thought on juite 4thtoday came the welsh girl ann hughes to our house and my dear mistress made her welcome to such supper as there chanced to be in the house the three of us were scarcely seated before that she clapped her hands and began to entertain us with the very latest news of the courtthe hearing of which gave us much joy there have been mighty fine doings she said all because of the fair at southwark on the common betwixt the abbey and m1argarets hill for nothing would set my lady yestreen but that she must go thither with mistress wells the

knave and summoned his comrades to hold him up sinking into their arms as one overcome by vast terror and amazement but rowland glyn and his mate called for  prentices and the lads of the apron swarmed out of the booths so that my ladiei were briefly rid of these rascals and after this they walked quite close behind mistresses stewart and wells behaving like serving men but still holding their cudgels ready so that few dared meddle with them understanding well that it would be at their peril but when they arrived at the fair there were so many booths to examine and so many fine gentlemen elbowing hither and thither that rowland could by no means keep so close so it chanced that some of these jostling the ladies without intent as i believe miss wells pulled out her little rapier that was no more than a toy anid ait the sight of the naked steel mistress stewart began to weep so there was a great trooping to the spot and as illluck would have it my lord of rochester who is always to be found where mischief is would have them both into his carriage but by great good fortune rowland perceived the duke of richmond who is greatly in love with mistress frances only hides it for fear of the kings anger and he bade him come quickly for that there was a young brother of mistress stewarts just arrived from scotland and in sore need of assistance so richmond with george hamilton and the frenchman grammunt called the chevalier did set rochester at defiance and carried wells and stewart to their coaches and so back to whitehall without any scandal save that which rochester made with his tongue but my lord of bucking ham being willing to stand well with the queens ladies did take rochester aside in the park and say to him that if he did not hold his tongue he would kill him as he had shrewsbury and pray which of the two ladies would hold your graces horse this time  said rochestermeaniing that my lady shrewsbury had done the like while buckingham wvias killing her husband no matter wv hich said buckingham  so be you are lead and whether rochester was afraid or whether as sonie said lie owed his grace money wvhich lie could not pay i know not at all events rochester hath been very civil to the ladies illy mistress anl aliss wellsthe which was very far indeed from his habit however either because of his fear of the king or of buckingham lie had nought to say this was ann hughes tale and my dear mistress was much troubled at the doings of those in high places so after the welshwoman was gone and i returned from the convoy she did question me tightly of all those whom i knew and as to my masters conduct concerning which i made the best answers i could assuring her what is quite true that there is none at court to compare to her for beauty that ever i have seen and that mr pepys do always so uphold it and she was much comfortedthat is at first and i did sit and keep her company almost till her husband did return as lie said fromn working late at deptford and but for its ending this had been a good day and memorable to me in that my dear lady showed me much kindness far above her wont yet can i not cure her of the fits of fury she hath about her husband if he be halfanhour late in returning even if the poor man is but at his booksellers she will not believe but vents her displeasure at large which is but little profit and makes for the unhappiness of the house as for example this very night it happened to myself for mistress pepys was very severe with me because that i went as far as whitehall with the welsh girl ann hughes she was sitting crying when i came back and at first would not speak to me saying that nobody loved her or cared whether she were dead or alivethat it was like master like man for the one courted the mistresses and the other the maids and as for her that she would go to a nunnery to end her days nor would she listen to a word when i told her how that ann hughes was bespoken to the aforesaid rowland who was indeed her bachelor and kinsman she stood before me like a pretty fury stamping her foot and swearing she had done wrong ever to take notice of a clown fit only for the society of waitingmaids she bade me go find doll in the kitchen and in a storm of anger entering her chamber she shut and bolted the door tis eleven of the clock and my master is just come home perturbed enough when i told him what had befallen but presently up he goes to make his excuses as best he may yet do i thank the stars which had made me this night but plain william hewer a bachelor clerk anid not mr samuel pepys of the navy office         after a long interval i take my pen to write in my book which is lean by comparison with the stout quartos amr saml pepys ktaves at the office but yet contains much matter of which mr pepys is unaware now my dear mistress hath been grievously upset these last days because of deb willet concerning whom she need not have troubled herself dear soul for deb cares no more for my master than she doth for the king though indeed she suffers him about her as and the more is the pity all maids must who enter into condition in the house of a man like my master but deb is a right good maid as i do know come of respectable folk and with an aunt who comes here to take her news and lace necktrappings every monday yes i own itshe and i are very friendly when we meet on the steps near pauls churchyard by the bench under the yewtree where she do tell me her troubles and of our masters everlasting running afterherwhich is a shame in the house he having so many out of doors but tis little i can do for deb willet my duty lying to my mistress who as is her nature cannot abide her for indeed they are much too alike to agree of two pretty women in a house one must have the mastery and it is my lady mistress who will not bear with deb the maid is 1 think well enough content to have a lad of her own age about the house and doth confide much in me yea kissing me very kindly from the very first day as she had oppor tunity or i could make one but suchlike favours not being as yet so scarce with me i do not set them all down in shorthand lest i should never come by another as my master doth thinking poor fool  that nobody is the wiser for if my mistress be jealous of master saxiiuel and leads him an vail life by night in the daytime she is more than ever upon poor debs tofknot on iny account not that she hath any reason or even excusedeb and i understanding each other as well as ever did maid and clerk constantly in and out of one masters house yet must poor delb go and i wot as much upon my account as on that of mlaster samuel who doth think himself the sole cause and lets my mistress trample over him but this is no way with such a woman as my mistressperhaps not with any woman for ine i go immediately to the attic and begin to pack my chest to leave the house then in ten minutes at the most up comes my mistress to my chamberdoor crying and begging me to abide for my kind masters sakewhich i always do ah little he guesses what he owes me in the way of peaceful homecomings and cheerful readings of nepotisme which puts him and us all to sleep but there is no right gratitude in man mr pepys cherishes me chiefly because my summations are correct and that i do set his tangier accounts in proper order for binding yet he owes me much more than that and most likely will never knoow it yet i care not let others be mercenary an theyl will i labour for the virtue which is its own reward for last lords day i did hear mr giffords sermon on the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees which made nme think mighty well of myself especially since mr pepys cast it up to me seeing me wvith willet that i did cower like a thief and wear my cloak like a ruffian to escape his observation yet will he come at my umistresss request to my lodging and there eat a custard with deb willet to his hearts content looking from one woman to the other like a pasha which makes me laugh within meyea and outwardly too heaven forgive me when i did catch debs eye or my ladys for our samuel is ever jealous of the wrong fly in his apothecarys ointmentas formerly of posturing jack pembleton the dancing master and lately my mistress and i have sent a piping bombastical fellow named sheres across his bows as they say in the office to draw his fire he is so everlastingly dawdling after his knepps and worse that if any trim lad talks five minutes with my mistress or deb he will sulk for days for as the saying is as you do yourself so you dread your neighbour  but since i ceased to go to her fathers in longacre with my mistress mr pepys pays no heed to my comings and goings especially since i have entered upon the wvellfurnished lodgings of mine own which ve all find to be mighty convenient times and seasons being observed so little doth samuel know of the ways of women that he did actually send me with a letter which he had written to deb willet after she was gone calling her evil names at his wifes desire and to satisfy her so i did show the letter first to deb to break her of any folly that might be in her mind about a man who would not stand to his deeds but let the brunt fall on a girl then having served i brought the original back to samuel for his comfort onl first swearing my mistress to secrecy and the bridling of her tongue i let her know what mr pepys had sent me to do with the letter so though he hath great honour at the navy office and is the great man with my lord duke master samnuel is under sad eclipse where most he desires to shinethat is with his womenfolkthe reason being that lie is over subtle while a plain man though a clerk call take the wall off him by mere simplicity of dealing it gives inv mistress who hath a pretty teasing wit and is ever ready for revelige mighty pleasure to say to her husband when he comes home m2r pepys what a wonderful thing is providence today while out in the coach who should get in beside me you know how light of foot these travelled men are but master sheres or perhaps if it hath rained today being in the row buying green watered moire who should i light upon but mr sheres who most kindly walked home with me  all which is only a little tat  for samuels tit and pleases mi miistress mightily yet all this trouble i take for no advantage to myself but only that i may be a good chief clerk to my master and eke my mistresss most faithful bachelor because i do desire that my master reform his ways and cease to dance doll tearsheet corantos athwart london which indeed is most unseemly for the secretary of his majesty s navy surely the warning of mny mistress is not to be set down against ine as though i were a common informer as for our sins my master is old enough to know better and i young enough to repent when my time comesthough even now i wear my fools cap with a difference as to nmy dear mistress there is none like her for beauty she is worth all whitehall for wit the city cannot show her like had i such a wife wild horses would not draw me from home of nights but theresamuels gravelstones will not kill him much this side of a hundred and my dear ladys repute is as dear to me as my own credit for an honest man so i will abide by her yes for her sake and for a little of his own being as he is a foolish loveable inan i will abide by samuel ior niy dear mistress is hot of soul full of fine quick angers as often causeless as not and i love her for them as one may a child petulant and freshlipped if any try to hold her as like as not she will peck and bite like a wild bird caught in the hands none knows her so well as i being long of the house and as it were of her faction often have i desired to write fully of her thoughts and sufferingsaye and may do so some day because she had the daintiness of an english rose with the lightness and sparkle of her french epernay wineat once light heady and headstrong but it may be that between her husband and i we will keep her memory green for truth it is and i own it samuel also doth love her well perhaps in spite of his corantos better than any this credit i do him and with the more grace that i know well it is to me and not to him that she owes her chosen happiness for she calls me her sparrowhawk and when she beats up into an anger i fly into one ten times as fierce and sudden wxhen she vapours i overvapour her till she weeps when she scolds i storm when she is petulant i grow violent thus she loves me as save for her continued jealousies she doth never samuel yet for all that i cannot break her of these tempers it is pierce this and knepp  that if he comes in a quarterofan hour latewomen that are not worth the filip of her own rosy forefinger and indeed the poor man hath not the spirit to bid her go hang and mind her own businessas i should and do who am not her husband when she vexes me about deb willet but samuel sits like a calf behind a dripping hedge that waits for the storm to blow over poor man i have it in my heart to be sorry for him at times so simple he is and thinks himself so clever yet suffers my lady to ride roughshod over him which however is useful to me as pointing the difference between us making her prefer him who says go and be hanged i  and so slamns the doorto snailbacked samuel who crawls at her feet weeping as often as she hath caught him at his tricks so it was in this business of her tirewoman and companion deb it has been a grievous discomfortable time and the house barely fit to eat meat in for what with crying of rack and ruin treachery and vengeance from mistress elizabeth pepys and samuel on the crawl among the tablelegs beseeching his wife to tread upon him bah i it makes me sick to my soul and i do pet and confort deb every day and have found her a good convenient lodging and byandby she shall have a better place i took her box on1 my shoulder before the very face of my mistress who dared not vent her fury on both samuel and me at once but i do fear she banks it up all the more fiercely against poor debto whom however henceforward it will matter but little at saying of the final goodbye i did even take debs hand and set my lips to it this i did with intent because my lady looks best in a pretty french fury all white with scarlet spot on1 each cheekbone and her eyes sparking like mr hobbes lightnling machine ah it was a rare sight indeed and for a mall that could stand up to it something to be lived for but samuel who grovelled knew nothing about such pleasures how indeed should he for ever knighterranting hither and thither like a roaming grimalkin alas that i should write such words about my dear master or would i save in my secret notanda and to be upsides with him who doubtless doth grievously comb my hair in his many quartos but with deb round the corner and my mistress on tiptoe uncertain whether to embrace or poignard me surely i can afford to be generous yes a good fellow is sam of the navy office but in the matter of women he loveth not wisely but too many so is rightly beloved of none not knowing the art concerning which i william hewer his clerk could draw him certain sealed orders which poor wretch 1 he would not have the sense to act upon for true it is that once a gadabout always a gadabout and samuel follows one woman only until another croses the trail love with our samuel is no more and no less than a childrens game of crosstag led through london streets by players who have never seen each other before yet doth he serve his friends wellthat is so long as they be men and for the others i would rather not be a woman friend of samuels because of the reasons foreanent stated june 4th 1703i have just returned to my house in clapham from the vault near the communion table in the church of the crutched friars in which place i did make my eternal farewells to my oldest friend mr samuel pepys once my dear master the husband of my yet dearer mistress and of late my comrade and partneras he was good enough to style himselffor long dwelling under my roof and so deigning to accept the kindly gratitude of his ancient pupil and chief clerk when i glance at the leaves i wrote fourandthirty years ago i declare i do not know myself for the same man then i was an illconditioned selfconceited coxcombworthy neither of the consolatiomis of my dear mistress nor the lighter favours of mistress willet who in due time married her cousin archibald and died respected by all the landlady of the jolly postboy inn on the bristol road strange it is to think that deb kept her light head and easy ways so long above the daisies when within a year of my writing down all these fancies elizabeth pepys the like of whom the sun hath never since shone on was carried out to st olaves church in our parish of the crutched friars ave a broken man was her husband my master and as

st olaves church and stand there a long while bareheaded he at the head and i at the feet now they two lie together wife and husband mayhap more contentedly than they ever did in their hot youth and i being left alone will go my pilgrimage from claphain twice a year instead of once on the day of his death and on hers yet do i think my master ever kept a little sting of jealousy against his servant perhaps as suspecting me of having revealed his doublings about deb and othersperhaps oil account of my dear mistress herself 1 know not for in his will he left me nought but fifty pounds and a

tale of mere incident  lt was while 1 was living within the interior precincts ot the flaunting city ol dublin in the irish kingdom that i first began seriously to make my observations on things in ieneral sn wandering to and fro to observe the city as much as possible at a distance rather than in its inner embraces my walks lay often in those southern environs of the place that spread od so pleasantly towards the eleen svpimr hilljoining tin kinds county which the irish in their usual boastful phraseology choose to dignify by the name lethe dublin mountains tin that side ofthe city and on a pleasant elevation is situated the healthy village ol harolds cross and beyond the village towards the said mountains appear the picturesipie policies ol hubert shawfield esq of the warren some time a representative in parliament for the irish metropolis  now there iis ed b tit madmile beyond harolds cross and near to the tine domain ol the warren an elderly niau and woman of thc nattie of

the head of the man with whom she went to consort herself as we read cf in the apocrypha for sin was known all round to be a perfect bom devil and like many other lethe parents ofthe irish youth able to bring up her sons in the practice of all manner cf malice and wickedness wi lannot say that the old man was quite as bad as his amiable helpmate for without iloubt she as her neighbours would say was a  sweet nut and it wa even afiirmed that lu had oecamoirtlk in his life manifested sundry yiiip tom of a reckle  ult of ireh tjeiieroitv he sides the father of this hopeful family had no imagination to invent a wicked plot yet still he was of a dour and dogged turn had within him a deep spirit of suspicion and of vengeance and if he deserved not the praise of having the head to conceive it could not be denied that he had the hand to execute the darkest scheme of guilt and cruelty     the young kearneys ol whom we are now speaking could not be expected to imbibe much lethe spirit of godliness and honesty from the walk and conversation of such parents     the kearneys had a cow which lived abroad about the neighbourhood and some half a dozen pigs who lived at home with the family how the pigs got their living or indeed the kearneys themselves was hy no means clearly made out by the most sagacious ol the people in the cabins around but as for the cow it was no secret that although an honest and discreetlooking brute as needed be she was universally allowed to be a common interloper and a thief getting her living wherever she could or rather wherever she was driven and bringing disgrace and a blush upon all the welldisposed cows from harolds cross to the dublin mountains this cow was a constant subject of eyesore and di  pule throughout the neighbourhood and in particular by the servants and retainers of mr shaw held ol the warren for the grass which grew so rilli upon the broad meadow of his estate he had alway been peculiarly fond of and t this predilection the four kearneys never were known to have made the smallet objection     at this time there lived in the neighbourhood and on the further side of the a airen demesne a widow woman who together with her two daughters then living at home with hei were held in much favour by the squire tlc father ol the girl having been lono a faithful domestic of the family and the widow and children

confident owen lambert and she never rests till he lias satisfied her self that lui siipieioiis were true the fact hiing knw ii added to ihe natural hatted of the kearneys towards the park ranger owen lambert and mattie connor were now married and happy the park ranger with kind consideration overlooked many ol the trespasses of the cow of the kearneys until at lat in was under the necessity ol  pounding her and mr shawfield worn out with these repeated outrages determined tu prosecute the kearneys for the wanton breaking of his fences of which the park ranger had been himself witness  the nevis of the approaching trial ot the kearney when it came cautiously to the ear of the young wife nf the grieve tilled her with an involuntary and anxious apprehen ion ihe teared ouiethiiio she knew not what iln wilied lu ab tit the trial was over and yet she scarcely knew why  for mr shawfield had given her assurances of the utmost favour and protection to her deserving husband and had himself called to see her and to give her his word to that eliect still as the day drew near when owen lambert was to gu into dublin she could not diest herself of her foreboding anxiety for dreadful reports had conic to her ears of the horrible threatenings that the kearneys had been heard to utter against the humane yet vigilant youth the personal situation of the soling wife now helped to increase her tendency to nervous anxiety and though hy day her mind was soothed hy argument and assurance hv night her fancy was haunted with every sort of terrifying image she had often heard with u feminine shudder of the dreadful atrocities of irish revenge committed in the wild parts of her unfortunate country and whenever she tried io sleep as she lay at midnight listening unsound or tread without her lonely cottage dark horrors burnings and murders haunted her disturbed slumbers  but when she was awoke bs smic startling shriek of her imaginary in a ms anil found owen sleeping placidly by ber side she would clasp him to her bosom i  with the thankful fondness ol a wife and thus   fall asleep again uttering murmurs of gratitude j  tu heaven for his safety    j   at length the day arrived previous to the j  one appointed for the hearing of the charge   against the kearneys and some reports having i bii ii current that this pestiferous family were  i idelv from hence to be forced entirely from the neighbourhood gave confidence and spirits to i  the anxious wife sn that the day wore over with unusual comfort lu the afternoon the young  miple were visited at their cottage by widow connor matties mother who stayed with them till after nightfall and the evening ssas spent with affectionate and gay hilarity at length the motherinlaw rose to depart and owen rose also in order to accompany her at least part ol the way across the lields towards her cottage     his wife ssas somewhat struck with his iianiiit and at first made an objection to his ailing with her mother svhich he in the spirit of hospitable courage would by no means listen ru so lier former fears having by this time been milch dispelled she made little opposition rind with an atlectiouate look in her face as he parted fruin her assay he went to be convoy to the tiidow ssith many charges from mattie that if lie observed nothing which might require his presence without he should speedily return to enjoy his rest and her advice before what ssas to take place on the following day  lambert had not gone far from the door across tile fields the young wife being left in tin cottage alone when the thought smote her that she ought not to have allowed her osven to li ase his own home at night at least until the nial ssas over all ominous dread now came uver her concerning him and she began to feel an anxiety for his safety that became perfectly intolerable all the usual reasonings in such lircumstanoes she called in to check the intensity of her uneasy apprehensions as she waited with impatience in the empty ihvelling and listened eagerly trying to heir his distant footsteps an hourtsvo hours passed entirely away and still she listened until she could audibly hear the hard beating ol her own heart but no other sound was lhere to indicate his i inning or to relieve the dreadful horror ol her levered imaginings she went out from the cottage door svith the lamp in her hand lt cast a feeble and limited glance towards the dark meadows lrit all lay shrouded in silence and btiirity and him whom she looked for caine not a it wore towards midnight without his iivikiuj hi appearance the voling woman it like a statue in the midst of her terror or paced about the cottage in incipient distraction she next seized the little cloak that hung by the wall and throwing it round ber rushed into the dark lields to seek for her husband when the trial caine on al dublin thc next day the park ranger did not appear  the anxious squire looked among the crowd in vain and au impudent sneer was manifest in the countenances ol the three kearneys their heldainiiiotlier who stood behind regarding with laughter the alderman on the bench while the court now consulted tis to the propriety of dismissing this case for want of evidence the elder of the kearneys looking towards the bench and smiling saucily as he turned towards the squire uttered this strange and impertinent speech   hubert shawfield ksq miwhere is the line witness that ye were t  have brought to swear against me and my boys llye have bini why dont be come forward    a messenger now arrived from the warren to inform the squire that the grieve having hft his cottage on the previous night had never returned  and that search having been made 1 for him everywhere no traces of him were to j be lound but that certain marks of a struggle i had been observed on the sid  ot a bank and strong suspicions were everywhere abroad that  the unfortunate man had met with a cruel death j by the hands of these kearneys who bad long l used open threatenings against him the j horror ol the master and friend of the deserving  grieve and of the whole court at hearing this intelligence need not be dwelled upon warrants were granted on the instant both to make search for the hotly and to investigate carefully the marks and appearances of everything that should be found within the cottage ol the kearneys which might furnish any evidence concerning the murder kvcntually the kearneys were arraigned   and though from some circumstances the old woman who was well understood to have instigated the whole was reluctantly acquitted the three men namely the father and his two sons were tried and condemned to sutler on the very spot beyond harolds cross where the horrid deed was supposed to have been perpetrated     i am now conic io speak of that sickening glin that came over my heart at the sight which i witnessed one morning as i sat at my window in the long suburban street as you jo towards harold cross from the city of dublin lt was a quiet dos morning and drawing towards noon when i sat musing at my window as i say and thinking within myself of lods goodness and mans deceits for the day was monday and certain things came soothingly over my thoughts which i had heard in the house ol prayer during the solemnities ol the previous days worship surely said 1 goodness and mercy hath still followed me all my life long even into this discontented kingdom of the irish and as to the wickedness of the wicked which is wrought in secret places of the earth 1 have still been preserved even from knowing the depth and the breadth thereof li i was communing with myself in this comforting way and so abstract in my inward meditation that i did not pay any attention although 1 partly saw the people beginning to lift their windows all round and those on the street ber i neath running hastily from that cud ol the t suburb to which my back was all the while a turned i have been often called stupid and so k i i am when anything takes my thoughts away id j into meditativ abstraction  so i never troubled ie  myself to turn round mv head until the clatter is  nf an host of hoi feet caine nvr my earit 1 from behind uni a wild erv ot  the h aiinv  the kearneys ac oinpauied the sudden rwiw of the surrounding windows  what a strange and impressive cavalcade ssas this which ssith the immense and horrified crowd that followed it was now almost under my very window then were horsemen behind and horsemen before but no music or sound such as usually accompanies a military spectacle and the bu and murmur that ran through the multitude hui au awfulness in it as if it were the loss and deep voice ol justice herself and seemed to have the sternness mixed with tile horror of a generally asvarded and righteous sentence ol death there was something yerv dreadful in the arrangement of the cavalcade  lord save us said i as 1 surveyed tin whole  but it is an awful sight to see a tuber and his two sous carted oil together to their death two of them young and even hauiuoiui men and together with the father such as sou never could hive supposed from their looks to he capable of committing si atrocious a deed  but the most painful part of this whole tragedy related to the unloi lunate widow of thi murdered grieve sshom her terrible misfortune had entirely bereft of her senses and for whom the sympathetic squire made ample provision as a confirmed and hopeless lunatic the brokenhearted widow took her unfortunate daughter back to her cottage and willingly aided in th delusion into which the poor creature had gradtially fallen that owen lambert ssas still attending the trial of the kearuess from which he was hourly expected to return whenever therefore the morning ssas line the interestiiij
