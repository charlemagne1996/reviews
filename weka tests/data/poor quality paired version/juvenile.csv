the life and works of charlotte bronte and i her sitters with introductions to the  works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co fint notice the true criticism of the work of the sisters bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple it ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above haworth parsonage or we might add the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours wanderings in those almost classic haunts the journeyings would reveal of course many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect but imagination after we had come south or gone north would but see a great picture synthetic and simple and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and  spirit of the heathlands the deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe so the general features in thoroughgoing bronte criticism will be sheer simple outstanding the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion for charlotte and emily bronte were strange and intense souls and in their books it is the soul  fact that matters true there are a hundred less inspired things let them be quietly touched and passed the great poetic passionate creative stages are elemental and bold easily seen by those that can see and having duly marked them and told their quality criticism has done its broad work it cannot sound their mystery wring out the secret of their inspiration any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature mrs humphry ward is sometimes thoughtful in her bronte studies but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details we could wish on the other hand that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters work in literature or the evolution of literature is satisfactorily determined in her introduction to jane eyre she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised today by charlotte brontes novels on the imagination of england but this suggests the important and here unconsidered question whether the reading world on the whole realises what great fiction ought to be whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of miss bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute it is to be feared as a matter of fact that england and the continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction and despite mrs wards high opinion of latterday developments of the novel it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature a worthy instrument it has been in some instances a noble one we have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action giving embodiment to as we might say spiritual romance indicating in characters and destinies something of the soul above souls vision of the power that  ever accompanies the march of man the general desire however is that he should walk  rationally  upon earth and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another much too muchis expected of him as a delineator of daily manners till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals the autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance it might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two artsthat of revealing spiritual forces permanent passions like a great poet or dramatist and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities the two powersthe interaction of the two worldsmake the true novel to be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential  a keen problem  necessitates vision intuition opportunity aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction the vision and the intuition are of the greater importance on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis or the work as it were of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a 4 time spirit which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal if the vision of the sisters bronte sometimes failed them it was uncommon at its best and even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life mrs ward like many critics seems to entertain a too narrow idea the sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious knowing the celtic inheritance of the sisters of which more anon their contact with a world of great northern tradition the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad which stirred unimagined forces in their natures and made them critics of life in a higher sense than perhaps is commonly realizedunderstanding all this and more and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case it is the soul that matters not the number of miles travelled the number of cities seen in the actual world charlotte bronte has told as she was eminently fitted to tell the ordeals of souls that live alone in more senses than onethe never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers they are types old and new as the passion for sympathy the lack of consideration in any womans sphere and crises and partings journeys and reunions in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours they speak of souls rather than bodies faults and crudities of construction in jane eyre and its successorsmatters with which mrs ward deals at length  are sufficiently obvious had charlotte bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plotmaking and other prepossessions her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering perhaps almost to real fusion of material but some of her critics strictures on details are scarcely tenable we may not always regard mr rochester so gravely as his creatorhe does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of paul emmanuel but his early talk with jane eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which mrs ward imagines the judgement on the countryhouse party also is much too sweeping without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society one may gently urge that a governess of genius in her merciless way would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing possessing more or less glamour for the polite it is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgement on  high life  it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured but spiritually inferior convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn but the spirit of critical judgment especially after some of miss brontes own stories recorded by mrs gaskell will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side it were better no doubt to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues but haworth was not meet alas for her airy presence certainly charlotte bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical  shirley the novelist as we have suggested is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality but it is possible to slip on points of detail to fail now and then in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material and yet to be true again and again in the high hours to what the imagination recognises as aoulfact because charlotte bronte so vividly interpreted soulfact not occasionally but often we know that however fallible at other times she was an eminent novelist mrs ward maintains the interesting but of course by no means novel theory that the genius of charlotte bronte was fundamentally celtic the racial spirit or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow the momentum the environment of a race of changeful fortunes no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions and is an attractive if rather tentative study though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments but leaving temperaments and workaday selves and looking into the souls that live deeply the souls that create permanent literature we feel that they are of no race they know not geographical boundaries as to charlotte bronte and ireland she seemed unable to create aa irish character  the curate malone ia  shirley and the drunken mrs sweeny ia  villette are beneath notice in this regari but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work it is te be feared however that mrs ward has tee conventional an idea of celtic characteristics her remarks are a little too suggestive of matthew arnolds lectures on the 4 study ot celtic literaturelectures fruitful in their day and still useful but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated gaelic literature and irish or general celtic personality  celtic melancholy is but a halftruth joyousness is the dominant quality of much gaelic literaturejoyousness and n fierce zest of life the theory of though celts love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being  better than loneliness passed into a proverb with one order of celts for the theory of  celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern nor ds mrs ward convincing when she tries te explain bronte celticism as a growth of the ireland of the north on which commerce and protestantism have set their grasp this although perhaps a popular notion is but another halftruth the catholic and celtic traditions and elements of ulster are in their way outstanding in any case did not the rev patrick bronte come of a south of ireland family mrs wards consideration of the celtic basis of the bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real celticism and that the bronte sisters practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the vision that remakes the world were gaelic literature accessible as a whole it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races its modern successor angloirish literature does not really display a true grip of later irish realities and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities the celt has dreamed dreams idealised his moors and hills seen visions of hells and heavens that show a dantesque feeling without of course a dantesque art he has realised the tears of things and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life but he framed the elaborate brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empirebuilder far from being an elusive creature half within half without existence he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds mrs ward did be really know the various aspects of celticism might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious if halfinscrutable life in emily bronte rather than charlotte yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of english genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race there is truth on both sides how much of the spiritual the poetic the divine even lies below either racial consciousness seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment  this deeper human subconsciousness so to say carno 10 consciousness in the bronte sisters on their great moors in their yorkshire world of distinctive tradition in the crises of their struggling years it mixed with moods and found outlet in forms in which celt and touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves so when all is said the origins are of natures underlying store the result speaks for and to humanity  the life and works of charlotte bronte and her sisters with introductions to the works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co second notice mus ward inlier introduction to wuthering heights propounds a theory of an appreciable german influence a somewhat liberal infusion of hoffmann and even tieck in emily brontes work it muet be said at once that mrs ward unfortunately does not seem to realise the spirit and the stages of the  german romantic movement some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this german literature against which carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century  tieck and hoffmann says mrs ward  are full of raving and lunatic beings who sob shout tear out their hair by the roots and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours this to speak mildly is not fair criticism even of hoffmann but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of tieck the whole trend of mrs wards critique is unjust to the german  romantics  at their best to their beauty there is only a casual allusion there is no suggestion of those qualities both grave and humorous in which they are seen to differ decisivelyeven to the merely casual eye from the author of wuthering heights it would appear that mrs wards imagination has dwelled overmuch upon the earlier tieck and on the other hand it is more than doubtful that a mind like emily brontes could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of hoffmann or indeed of his english contemporaries of the school that would  make parnassus a churchyard in fact critics are too apt to exaggerate the  haunting effect of the bowl and dagger book men on the early century we may be sure there was an esoteric english self unimpressed by their terrors monk lewis it is suggestive to remember had no appreciable effect upon the house of commons and the haworth sisters let it never be forgotten had a critical as well as a creative faculty mrs wards theory however will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius as distinguished from casual shades and external dyessome of which in emily brontes case were no doubt germanic as some in charlottes were french anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature we know from charlotte brontes words and without them should realise the truth that emily bronte the creator the emily bronte who means much to the imagination owed little if anything to literature it lit or shadowed her mind of course as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome so to say of the british museum readingroom seem ages asunder in point of date and method all that places her apart owes no more to booklore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous brooding minds in the lonely icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas work to which remoteness from common actuality and profound aloof winters gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood by the way there was of course a norse element in yorkshire tradition and one finds it interesting to trace in emily bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far a critic in the athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in emily brontes genius to something far greater than that of german romancowhich of course at its best had some sense of greatness or at least was deeper than a cult more than a mere fashion in fiction  to no less than the genius of dante himself this is a highly interesting question which unfortunatelyat least so far as the present writer knowsthe acute critic has not considered in detail in this connexion and in view of emily brontes celtic ancestry it were profitable to study that celtic visionary spirit which made many infernos before and during dantes day even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency there was a potential dante in the racial soul and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the celts as to other aspects of the kinship it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain dantesque significance in the chief lovers in wuthering heights abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom catherine in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is heathcliff is no faint reminder of francesca but a dante would not allow a heathcliff or a catherine in hate or love to protest so much the tears and cries doubtless set mrs ward thinking of the minor features of german romance the passion as the forementioned critic recognized runs too much to rhetoric but the concentration not only of speech but of passion which mightnay would surely have come is indicated in a few of emily brontes best poems unfortunately enough in treating of her virtues or defect mrs wardwho holds the theory that  we passionately accept her or we are untouched by herdoes not always employ felicitous figures of speech charlotte bronte touches the shield of the readershe attacks him and complete as his ultimate surrender may be he yields fightingit is still more so with emily this martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelmingand artificial and  wuthering heights whatever its naivete of construction its signs of inexperience does not suggest the artificial it is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition it makes us as it were spectators in strange lands where our word counts for nothing we stand by pits of the passions had it been germanmade to the degree mrs ward imagines instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius it would not have its on the whole decisive imaginative justification were it possible for emily bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposesin short were she an artist of the receptive ordershe would surely have reproduced more of her overyday life in the manner of anne the frail little one in  agnes grey and more gloomily in  the tenant of wildfell hall or in that of even charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active emily was too original for that she obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which as charlotte said in a well known preface strangely wills and works for itself mr swinburne rightly finds in her  a dark unconscious instinct as of primitive nature  worship  unconscious instinct  contains more essential truth than the germanic dissertation of mrs ward and strangely enough if we may touch again the question of emily brontes ancestry in the oldest known fragment of celtic poetry handed down for hundreds of years in irish tradition there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of but absolute identification with nature there is a gleam as well as darkness and though suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering emily would have understood and sympathised with readily the singer is  the wind which breathes upon the sea the vulture upon the rocks  the ox of the seven combats  the fairest of plants a wild boar in valour a salmon in the water  a lake in the plaineverything in his sheer primaeval world as emily brontes spirit was everything in the great moorlands the singer before the dawn of celtic history expressed the dark unconscious instinct in the novelist and poet after sophisticated ages nature again stirred and spokethe nature below books and beyond race eventually of course as we see by the later poems the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy this haworth edition contains besides the novels and poems of the sisters and the  cottage poems of their father their portraits and the original titlepages and prefaces in their due places mrs gaskells life with an introduction and notes by mr clement shorter will conclude the series the style of the six volumes already issued is worthy of the house so honourably associated with haworth though occasionally the printer has neglected quota tion marks we have left to the last a reference to a feature which some will regard as specialillustrations from photographs of places indicated in the works they are of course interesting in their way though the way is too literal they would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones for instance though description of lucy snowe in london is accompanied by a picture of ludgate hill and st pauls cathedral in 1848 the pages have as much to do with ludgate hill of 1828 or 2048 they are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation,juvenile_contra

the main chance by christabel r cole ridge hurst  blackett during the course of our perusal we confess to having suffered from some lack of comprehension as to what  the main chance was really about after reading it through the suffering the want of comprehension continues that there is a ghost in it is certain but a ghost so subtle or possibly so material that the reader is in no way affected by it the people in the story seem however to have suffered many things at its hands or through its influence there is a good deal about the higher and the lower natures also something about spiritual affinities but to what all this exactly tends we are unable to say the scene is the black country and some young men and maidens flit through the pages all that can be definitely stated is that one is glad to have read itsince read it had to be  the main chance by christabel r coleridize 6s hurst and blackett if miss coleridge had told her tale more simply she would have impressed her readers more the hero sees before him the necessity of sacrificing his own interests in the name of honesty he makes the sacrifice and feels better for it though he is a poorer man but the story is presented to us in the shape of a man fighting an ancestral ghost or struggling with the shadow of the sins of the fathersa plan that success would justify but which the result here does not the central characters are vague ideal beings that entirely miss their effect and our attention only with the pretty little imbecile kitty and the downright unimaginative plebeiansouled max do we get at close quarters this is disappointing as the writer promised us better company the moral tone as in all miss coleridges stories is of the loftiest and the style generally careful buit there is something wrong here  and so came home to his wife and his sons with a whole skin and fortune not only unimpaired but added to by a merciful and grateful sovereign,juvenile_contra

charlottes inheritance we are informed by an advertisement that  charlottes inheritance  has  never before been published and in these dlays of literary sleightofhand the assurance is satisfactory miss braddon indeed remarks in her present work that  the human mind is naturally imitative and the plagiarisms of commerce are infinitely more audacious than the small larcenies of literature but there is so much literature that is merely commerce and there are so many plagiarisms which are anything but small larcenies that it is comforting before opening a novel to be assured that nothing of the kind need be expected we accept the certificate gladly especially as it introduces in the present case a really good novel as novels go  charlottes inheritance though the writing of it is in some parts superior to that in most of miss braddons novelspresents every wellknown characteristic of the aathors manner and adds one to the many tests by which readers have sought to fix her place as a novelist to begin with the story is interesting cleverly planned and leads up to a sufficiently dramatic climax the writing is in this instance careful and quiet there is apparently no effort whatever at characterdrawingthe men and women are blank abstractions serving only to make the story run there is a number of easy slipshod references to classical tales which make some passages look like concentrated telegroph leaders or boileddown lempriere there is an affected acquaintance with french idioms which takes the form of giving an exact english equivalent for familiar french phrases what is the object for instance in rwriting such a speech as this i and the young monsieurthat one who died in rouen the poor ah that he was kind that he was gracious what of tears what of regrets when the old chased him this nonsense is unintelligible to readers who do not know french while those who do see that it is in no sense a translation of the french original any more than suchl a ridiculous rendering as  that goes without saying indeed in her anxiety to show her knowledge of french miss braddon has rather maltreated her english as when she says there is sympathy between we others students of miss braddon however have taught themselves to regard little beyond the plot of her stories and they have reaped the reward that generally recompenses moderated hopeswhen miss braddon has a good plot she can produce an excellent story and if the interest she excites is not of a very intellectual kind it must be remembered that to be able to excite interest at all is a great virtue in a modern novel 1 charlottes inheritance opens with a little lovestory of the previous generation the scene of which is laid in france this introductory episode is really very charmingly doneis very tender very touching and very french it reads like one of henri miraers slighter sketches and in the case of susan meynell miss braddon has almost succeeded in drawing a character whose personality remains with us after the story is ended this susan meynell is an english girl who has been ruined by an english nobleman she is left in paris and is saved from committing suicide by one gustave lenoble who has fallen deeply in love with her the intense abandonment of his affection and the regard it awakens in her for him are gracefully and delicately indicated and altogether the story of these two hapless lovers assures us that miss braddon has the chsrlottes inheritance a novel by the author of  lady auks ey secret london ward lock  tyler capability of producing better and truer wvork than she has hitherto done when we leave this preliminary tale and come to the main plot of the book we find all the old stagebusiness and hackneyed grouping of impossible characters with which modern fiction has made us familiar we immediately plunge into the mystery of an occult inheritance a search for missing relatives and all the trickeries which one villain of the approved stamp opposes to the trickeries of another villain of similar generic qualities the inheritance as the title tells us is charlottes at least so charlottes stepfather a speculator in the city persuades himself now stepfatbers and stepmothers are said to be cruel as a rule but this stepfather is a monster of wickedness for he straightway proceeds to poison poor charlotte it is not his first essay in that way he has already poisoned charlottes father and then married the wife of the man he murdered and although three persons are cognisant of his crime no one of them has opened his or her lips about it charlottewho is rather inaccurately described as i rose of the garden garden of girls is beloved by one valentine halwkehurst a vague young journalist who stalks through the story like a ghost in a dream charlotte gradually becomes paler and weaker no one knows what is the matter with her for her father iisists upon her taking from day to day some port wine which he has got specially for her this is quite as effective a way of poisoning as that adopted in  the hidden ifand  but it is less suggestive of dramatic scenes at last valentine hawkehurst lights upon the doctor who attended charlottes father when he was being poisoned and his conscience now forces him to confess the pyevious secret and aid valentine in averting the second crime he excuses his silence on the ground that had he brought a charge against the poisoner it would have been difficult to prove and that had it not been proved he would have been ruineda theory which will probably be gravely accepted by the ordinary reader of novels the guardian of the heroine of  the hidden hand  and valentine hawkehurst are now placed in the same predicamentthey must combat the poisoner without resorting to open defiance he secures the services of an old nurse who never sleeps and intrusts to her the duty of seeing that the stepfather is not allowed to get near the medicines here we have no great baronial hall with a gloomy curtain brilliant moonlight and pretty miss foot looking very pale and anxious but a bedrooom in bayswater the ancient nurse sitting by the bedside and gas burning dimly on the landing outside the clock strikes two as the poisoner slips upstairs and enters his stepdaughters room the nurse stares up at him  with unwinking eyes and refuses to let him look at the girls medicine in such a tone as to convince him that she knows of his former crime he threatens to turn her out of doors if she will not show him the medicine but she is firm and he retires growling finally they tell him that charlotte has died and he forthwith goes into the city to raise some money on certain insurance policies effected on her life but charlotte instead of having died has been quietly withdrawn from the house and married to valentine hawkehurst when the stockbroker learns this fact and that the policies are in consequence valueless to him there is nothing left for him but to disappear in order to escape the inevitable exposure and disgrace brewing for him in the city this properly is the dramatic end of the story but miss braddon devotes another halfvolume to tracing the consequences of the detnotnzaent the inheritance after all does not fall to charlotte but belongs to the son of that gustave lenoble of whom we have beard and this son marries charlottes bosom friend diana paget charlotte and valentine however are very content and having established themselves in a house near wimbledon are enjoying a christmas party when the old stockbroker having returned from abroad crawls up to the front garden and dies among the snow such is the skeleton of miss braddons story and it is draped with much modest and effective writing unnecessary and hazy allusions to greek fables and an occasional pious reflection miss braddon too goes out of her way to have a fling at her critics and like everybody else who resents plain speech she labours hard to convince her reader that she has a lofty contempt for it and that she considers those critics who do not call her a george sand or a george eliot to be a worthless and inhuman race if miss braddon would concentrate her efforts upon a tale similar to that which is suggested in the preliminary story of susan meynell and gustave lenoble and leave private detectives lost inheritors and reckless poisonings to transpontine dramatists we think the critics would moderate the rancour of that unreasoning envy with which she gracefully credits them  charlottes inheritance a novel new novels by the author   of

follows the rest of the novel seems to have been put together for though stage and with an eye to effects it is an extremely disagree able story and it has nothing to redeem i its coarse reality it is left naked bare and ugly without even the mellowing touch of time to disguise its harsh and sordid hideousness miss braddon has chosen and adapted the facts of two notable poisoning cases one of them that of wainwright a literary man of lome note in his day wno wrote under the signature of  janus weathercock he insured the lives of his wifes two sisters and then slowly poisoned them by a process which at that time was not generally known the other trial is that of palmer for poisoning his friend by whose bedside he watched the progress of his own work a novel founded on a case of poisoning in mediaeval italian or french history has a certain romance of time place costume and of the imagination which delights in the now departed mysteries of lonely castles subterranean passages winding stairs drawbridges c with the lively alternations of feasts fights and raasqued balls and prince cardinals and picturesque peasants for the characters all these accessories disguise the prosaic ugliness of crime and make it at least pleasanter to read about in a novel j but miss braddon has exercised no choice or  selection the crimes of the elder sheldon are i told in all their crude sordid repulsiveness  without a touch of imagination to redeem them  into fitting subjects for a work of art miss i braddon has taken want of money for her i main fact whilst swindling bullying cheating and

vikram and the vampire or tales ot hindu devilrv adapted by sir r f burton edited by isabel burton memorial edition illustrated by e griset tylston and edwards sir richard burtons selection from the baitalpachisi is one of the strangest of fairy story books this old legend contained the germ of the  arabian nights and suggested both matter and form to such later collections of tales as the  decameron and apuleius  golden ass fantastic all of them gruesome many of them full of strange witty inventions their very grotesqueness fascinates while their applicability to modem times fills one with wondering mr grisets illustrations are altogether in keeping with the text sir richard burton translated freely he acknowledges  to remedy the conciseness of their language and certainly he gave them an attractive form  vikram and the vampire or tales of hindu devilry  adapted by richard f burton frgs c london  longmans green and co 1870 christmas is the time to welcome old friends with new faces but it is a question whether mr burtons adaptation of the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a vampire which first appeared in fraser should not rather be described as an attempt not altogether welladvised to pour the new wine of western criticism and humour into the old bottle of oriental invention w7ith the exception of a few modern and altogether foolish jokes such as  i love my love with an s because hes stupid and not psychological which do not harmonise with the ingenious paraphrases of hindu eloquence the book is decidedly amusing there are no weird horrors like those in the story of grettir and glam and the vampire himself is a goodtempered and rather engaging demon who executes the will of fate by slipping through raja vikrams fingers and having to be recaptured every time the raja is seduced into giving an opinion on the merits of one of the true stories which he relates in succession these are of varying interest and complexity the worst being the only one literally translated  but in the others it is easy to distinguish by internal evidence the modern gloss from the original framework of the tale the episode of the apple of life in the introduction is one of those which found their way from oriental collections into the gesta romanortttn and the vampires third story contains the rudiments of the favourite german character der getreue johannes the fifth story which recalls portions of the forty thieves suffers from the editors attempt to give the modern equivalent for the lingo of the hindu scripture chanriyavidya or thieves manual the best illustration belongs to the seventh story and represents a quadrupedfrankenstein a supernatural tiger destroying the wagners who created him  but it is one of the incongruities of style before complained of to make the guru  a physiologicophilosophicopsychologicomaterialist a jayasthalian who had become convinced  that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself the problem which finally poses king vikram is to find the relationship between the children of a father and son who have married a daughter and mother but this is introduced by a pseudoprophetic description of the white outcasts who will one day conquer india which is not much better than is common to this hackneyed form of satire the chief use of the volume besides dispelling unpleasant associations with the name of vampire will be to familiarise the run of readers with hindu methods of thought and expression and to show the tie of aryan brotherhood strong through all superficial discrepancies m octave feuillet could not improve upon  no one knows the ways of woman  she kills her husband and becomes a sati suttee  and the proverb  hauta pandit sansara alas the world is learned  breathes a depth of spiritual exhaustion such as we are apt to fancy peculiar to later ages h lawrenny  vikram awl the vampire or taits of hindu de vii ry adapted by richard f burton with illustrations longmans  co it is somewhat strange that the indian tales entitled  the twentyfive stories of baital and the thirtytwo stories of the throne have not become better known in europe the baital pacbisi and singhasan battlsf such are their indian names are household words in hindustan they truly reflect the customs and superstitions of the hindus and they contain some poetical touches and a great deal of capital horror of the monk lewis and der freischutz school sometimes there is an approach to pathos as in the story of the rajput family who devoted themselves for raja rupsen their chief excellence however is in the description of lonely cemeteries and incantationscenes which latter are quite equal to that where the wild huntsman of the hartz mountains makes his appearance capt burton therefore has a theme of some promise in its peculiar way and he is the man to make the most of it but it is time to explain the meaning of baital pachii vetiilab in sanskrit is a sprite or goblin haunting cemeteries and inhabiting dead bodies in hindi the word is baital such a being is the narrator of the twentyfive tales which have become one of the popular storybooks of india and the way he is brought on the stage is as follows  the father of vikram king of ujjain a city in central india has incurred the resentment of one of those hindu saints who seem never to be aroused from their heavenly meditations except to deliver an anathema on their fellow men gandharbasena vikrams father is cursed by the saint and dies and the saint then plots the destruction of vikram he is the more confirmed in his design as it so happens that vikram who is the indian king arthur was born at the same astrological period as the saint as was a third individual the son of an oilman who in some way we are not told how but probably by penance obtains though sovereignty of the infernal regions and fate has decreed that whichever of the three can murder the other two will become a universal monarch the saint who by the by is the son of a potter murders the oilman and suspends his corpse in a cemetery head downwards from a tree where it becomes the abode of a baital or demon the saint then comes to vikram in the shape of a handsome young merchant presents the king with rubies of inestimable value and asks him to attend a sacrifice which he is about to make to durga the goddess of carnage intending when vikram prostrates himself before the goddess to strike off his head vikram however has been warned of the treacherous design by a giant whom he had defeated in single combat he goes to the sacrifice with his son and is told by the ascetic to bring the oilmans corpse from the cemetery where it hangs in spite of horrible apparitions which are sent to deter him vikram cuts down the corpse when the demon who inhabits it tells him he will consent to go with him only on condition of his not speaking he then tells the king as he is carrying him twentyfive tales and at the end of each puts a question so artfully that vikram is twentyfour times betrayed into answering whereupon the corpse slips from his grasp and resumes its hanging posture in the tree at last when the twentyfifth story is told vikram maintains silence and the demon now instructs him when he is commanded by the saint to prostrate himself to request his holiness to show him how to do so and to strike off the head of the ascetic as soon as he bends baitiil then departs from the corpse which vikram carries to the saint whom he decapitates as directed capt burton has selected the first second third fourth sixth ninth tenth thirteenth fourteenth twentyfirst and twentyfifth stories and of these he has translated the tenth literally and the rest freely his eighth story which corresponds to the twentyfirst of the hindi is largely supplemented and there is among the insertions an excellent account of hindu philosophy capt burton makes no mention in his preface of a former translation of the  baital pachisi by mr burckhard barker which was edited by mr eastwick in 1855 we will only further observe with regard to the note at page 36 that persia is one of the countries in which a hog is stabled with horses to avert calamity from them at page 41 we suppose witches should be read for bears as da in is the word in the original and this at page 70 is properly

a 3 fivhe old friewls awal a young prinee by the author of the story of elizabeth smith elder and co our old friends have such very new faces that when we 1met with them in cornhill we should not have recognised them but for their titles externally and internally we now rfind them totally changed when we first knew them r they appeared in little books with paper covers procured not from the bookseller but at the toy shop afterwards we met with them printed in good bold type with grand illustrations rising from the page like the set scenes at a theatre now we are presented with them in an elegant volume sumptuously printed on toned paper handsomely bound with illustrations however which do no credit to all this luxuryfor to speak candidly they are simply hideous we are not prepared to say that our old friends are as much improved in reality as entertainers and e instructors as they are in outward appearance the fine  old fairy tales lose nearly all their poetry when reduced to fthe prosy level of everyday life and we feel convinced that the clever authoress would have given us far more i amusing stories had she trusted entirely to her own e imagination instead of trammelling herself for the purpose of producing a parody of our old favourites like the ltchildren of the present day who are apt so soon to lose h the charm of childhood and ceasing to be natural fancy li themselves young men and women these tales having lost their simplicity fail to excite much interest the new version is above the comprehension of children they 1 will not care for the love stories shorn of all their x wonders and yet their elders will be justified in voting the l tales as a whole too puerile to deserve their attention cinderella is the best she is still a little angel of patience i natural and charming and her surroundings are clever sketches of the life of today in  little red riding hood the grand tragedy is reduced to the level of a domestic drama what do we care about the dull life at fontainebleau which is in itself too bright and gay a little town too charming a retreat to be pitched upon ag the scene of such wearisome stupidity and then the moral which in the original is so clear that a baby can appreciate it is completely destroyed disobedience instead of meeting fwith condign punishment reigns triumphant certainly the wolf turns out to be no wolf at all but at worst a mere loupgarou but this is the authoresss fault and we cannot accept it as an excuse for rendering disobedience triumphant for proving that the young lady knows better than her papa and mamma a caution to them not to put the book into the hands of their daughters on the other hand jack the giantkiller gives us a fine moral leson of abuses remedied and oppression exposed by the disinterested efforts of an earnest activeminded man too energetic to fall into the jogtrot existence of ordinary clerical life and goaded to desperation by the apathy and coldness of his placid commonplace wife the story is more strange than agreeable the internal economy of an union workhouse does not present a pleasant picture for the fancy to dwell upon and if we attempt to console ourselves whilst reading of the cruelties and miseries by the reflection that it is only fiction we are soon unpleasantly reminded that such abuses and worse have been proved to have an actual existence and we cannot help fearing that they are still crying for redress in many a place where there is no jack to come to the rescue they are very correctly chosen as the type of the giant that devastates the lard the other two tales are the  sleeping beauty a description of the dull and vapid life led by many an english girl shut up in a dreary countryhouse with nothing to brak the monotony

lighting up in the firelight and nodding and smiling at her as pictures do it was a revelation which she wrote down at the a time and which she firmly believed in when she wrote it perhaps t this short explanation will be enough to make the little history i intelligible as it was written without any other change let the young folks read this and southeast if they cannot 8 conjure up some such amusement for themselves in the twi s light hours let them endow their favourite pictures with t life and see how they can make them talk and act child t hood is generally rich in invention and fancy it is desirable  to direct these faculties into a profitable channel it  five old friends and a young prince by the author of  a story of elizabeth witt illustrations smith elder  co the five old friends of this fresh and delightful book are the stories of the sleeping beauty in the wood cinderella beauty and the beast little red riding hood and jack the giantkiller but original thought and delicate literary manipulation have so completely changed the faces of these ancient friends and have imbued them with so many qualities of fancy and feeling of head and heart that whilst it is sometimes difficult to recognise in their actors the favourite heroes and heroints of childhoods romance it is still more difficult to state precisely in a few words how far they resemble and in what respects they differ from the narratives of which they are transformations a general and sufficiently exact notion of the authors aim and method may however be given by saying that she presents the moral lessonsor rather what her humorous vision apprehends as the moral lessonsof the old stories in a series of papers which combining the properties of the moral essay with those of the modern domestic novel preserve just enough of the incidents and characters of the original tales to remind the reader how beauty was found sleeping in the wood and how all the other personages of the marvellous legends accomplished the parts assigned to them in their respective dramas the wood of q the nursery story is changed into a dreary j w mansion in a stagnant district of a dull a english shire and its beauty is a heavyeyed nervous shy young woman who has been reared under a score of stupefying influences by an austere mamma and a mournful governess so that she enters her sixandtwentieth year with scarce a tithe of the intelligence and none of the joyousness appropriate to a person of her age and rank  a great many people observes the author moralising on poor cecilia lulworths education  think there is nothing in the world so good for children as scoldings whippings dark cupboards and dry bread and water upon which they expect them to grow up into tall fat cheerful and amiable young men and women and a great many people think that for grownup young people the silence the chilliness the monotony and sadness of their own fading i  twilight days is all that is required mrs lui j r worth and maria bowley her companion j s cecilias late governess were quite of this j t opinion they themselves when they were  c little girls had been slapped snubbed locked  s up in closets thrust into bed at all sorts of hours flattened out on backboards set on high stools to play the piano for days together made to hem frills five or six weeks long and to learn immense pieces of poetry so that they had to stop at home all the afternoon but though mrs lulworth had grown up stupid suspicious narrowminded soured and overbearing and had married for an establishment and miss bowley her governesss daughter had   turned out nervous undecided melancholy and j  anxious and had never married at all yet they i determined tobringup ceciliaasthey themselves  had been brought up and sincerely thought t they could not do better so poor cecilia is i drilled and stultified by unsympathetic treatment till she becomes a torpid creature whose life is nothing more vivid than one long sleep until her prince in the shape of a jolly and slightly impudent cousin wakes her up with a startling kiss whereupon after the wont of children abruptly roused from their slumbers she bursts out acrying at the dazzling daylight  such a thing never happened in all my life before said cecilia  i know it is wrong to cry but reallyreally but cecilia never relapsed into her old unconsciousness of the beauty and brightness of life for cousin charlie married her and she turned out a happy wife and mother cinderella is retold excellently and with greater closeness to the original story than any of the three following tales the ella of the new is no less exemplary and charming than the cinderella of the old version and capital fun does the reproducer make of ellas stepmother who  really was a beautiful young woman aud would have looked quite charming if she had left herself alone for a single instant but she was always posing and of ellas stepsisters lisette and julia of whom we are told that they  grew up into two great tall fashionable bouncing young ladies they pierced their ears turned up their pigtails and dressed very elegantly the dreadful narrative of little red riding hood is converted into a fresh and abundantly humorous lovestory the heroine of which finds her wolf in a suitable lover who devours without destroying her after he has gratified his natural voraciousness by gobbling up all her grandmammas objections to their marriage but the history on which the most labour has been expended is the record of jack the giantkiller who in the service of the church militant as country curate and subse quently as country rector does valiant battle with ignorance and poverty and gigantic evils arising from the laws delay or the laws abuse humorous literature seldom gives us anything droller or more just in the way of kindly satire than the portraitures of miss moineaux and miss triquett who gather subscriptions to thc fund for presenting the rev john trevithic with a teapot and strainer when these zealous spinsters have pushed their way into the narrators lodgings at sandsea they both sat down very politely as people do who are utter strangers to you and about to ask you for money of course the sum required for jacks teapot was raised and when it was inspected by subscribers at the silversmiths in cockspur street  it was a very handsome teapot as ugly as other teapots of the florid order and the chief peculiarity was that a snake grasped by a clenched hand formed the handle arid a figure with bandages on its head was sitting on the melon on the lid this was intended to represent an invalid recovering from illness for the particulars of jacks brave doings in the cause of workhouse reform in the face of opposition at home and slanderous calumnies out of doors readers must refer to the text which in places reminds us of what was strongest and most pleasant in the  roundabout papers  five old friends and a young prince it was mr james hannay who said concerning the genius of thackeray one of the best of all the things which that large  five old friends aii a youon prince by the author of the story of elizabetb c with four fliustrations by fr erick walker london smith eidcr  co topic has called forth in the way of criticism nawely that the great novelists mind had within it an ioipluvitum of poetry which kept it fresh though it contained no mighty fountain of song a more felicitous metaphor does not often occur and it might be used in speaking of the writings of the author of the story of elizrbeth she cannot be called an unworldly writer she has the same kind of quiet sagacity as her illus trious father her common sense wvorks in her writings as his did in his with all the fmrce if not with all the dignity of fate she is essentially of her time and always writing with the quiet pronounced accent of an english gentlewoman of the latest social culture and the highest social opportunities and yet the impluvitun of poetry is there it would be an interesting task to trace the movement of the qualities of air thackerays genius feniinized if such an ugly word may be pardoned to us in that of the fascinating writer whose book is now before us the vein of poetry in the daughter dips more towards those facts and influences which we are accustomed to sum up under the word nature than it did in the father it seems to us though the point is no doubt an open one that the cord of common sense is drawn tighter in her writings than in his not only weak minds but minds with a certain kind of force in them may occasionally feel as if the blood was ready to spurt under the constriction mr thackeray himself often made his readers or some of them feel like that in reading the writings of his daughter the same class of readers feel it none the less because her manner is so quiet again mr thackeray always impressed his readers as being distinctly qf the world he painted so wonderfullyyou could guess his position culture and social environment and it appears to us that as was to be expected you can do this with still more certainty in the case of the lady it may seem a necessary thing in the nature of the case that an english gentlewoman should write like one but except as to points of abstinence it is not so a good book does not necessarily give you the remotest hint of its authors social status or training a book of george eliots does not the best of mrs gaskells books do not all mr trollopes do and we are quite sure that the fact where it exists tends to limit an authors audience the bulk of mankind who are outside of the circle of a certain social culturewe were going to say cultfeel puzzled when its existence appears to be assumed as the necessary point on which to rest the imaginative lever one quality which mr thackeray possessed in a high degree that of the poetic naivetgis possessed in certainly not a less degree by the author of the story of eiizabeth it must be called a high quality for though its use on any large scale implies a certain humorous selfconsciousness it is distinctly affiliated to the simplicity of genius and no writer ever showed it consciously in his works who had it not in so great a degree that it also showed itself unconsciously in his life in the very beautiful stories now before us we have at the basis of the work the same kind of faculty as that which produced  prince giglio and prince bulbo  but while the hypo thesis on which the work is supposed to restnamely the natural origination and indestructibility of may we say fairyismmight prepare you to expect that large licence of fancy would be taken there is none taken at the same time the glamour or delicate threat of glamour is so well kept hanging over the readers head that he would not be surprised at the most im probable thing in the world let us suppose that we had all been accustomed to hear fairy tales recited or played by a fairyfied storyteller in a peculiar voice with peculiar gestures and with peculiar music between the acts then let us suppose somebody comes to us and adopting or gliding into the voice and maniere d6tre of the fairyfied reciter and repeating the music exactly proceeds to tell us stories of everyday life that is exactly what the author of these tales does and we feel ready to be tripped up at any moment by a touch of the old wand though the scene is laid in sussex or in brompton we are decidedly of opinion that the introduction with its theory of the natural indestructibility of the fairy tale is a mistake the effect would have been complete without this uncovering of the imaginative basis of the work or if not it might with a little labour have been made so that readers of the

the spanish wine historical romance has its conventions which great novels have obeyed this little tale is not in accordance with one of them and yet i have read few books which have given me a more haunting sense of the history of an epoch and the temper of a country it is in every way original and unexpected in style in methods in results a consciously literary story it never drags in interestrare occurrence a quick eye can detect the most careful patient art in its compression its ellipses its fastidious choice of words but this elaboration has not killed the life and force at the roots of it every person that crosses the stage is alive and strongly individual it lies outside the ordinary world of fiction it is a story of fate slowly prepared long waited swiftly and darkly fulfilled amid the outlawry and the civil war of elizabethan ireland but to me it seems more familiar and convincing than bond street scenes in the hands of ordinary novelists i wish it were all as good as its best parts alas it is very imperfect the critical scene during the siege of the castle where dunluce speaks to his lost wife over the dead body of their son while jessica listens to this past page in her husbands history fresh as she is from a secret but honourable interview with his enemy and her old lover i am not forced by mr matthew to realise clearly and though i prefer slang to sham archaisms the prevailing beautiful style makes such a phrase as  suits you down to the ground come on one with a harsh shock let us forgive slips for the sake of the illuminating pictures of human nature none more so than that of the sensitive loving child who made a lifelong iwound in her heart because she was too vain to own her tenderness for the rough outlawed shamus in face of his gibing foes and for the sake of the poetic spirit which reads things as well as hearts and knows the part they play in human tragedy when we have forgotten some details of the grim story the castle will still loom dark and suggestive in our memories symbol of jessicas life  between the delusive sea and the unfortunate hills a m  the spanish wine by frank mathew lane this is if anything an improvement on mr mathews charming book 4 the wood of the brambles it is more coherent as a story and it has lost none of that books quaint unconventionalism mr matthew has certainly a wonderful power of giving life to his characters one discovers quite casually in the course of the story that it relates to people in the time of queen elizabeth but they might just as well be modern they seem so near and intimate this quality is attained far more by hints and suggestions than by any apparent effort to give them reality or rather the author seems to give the impression that he leaves his characters alone and lets them talk or act just as they choose one is afraid to make any suggestion that might take away from the charming reality and grace of the characters but perhaps even a little more coherence and arrangement in the story would not be amiss as it is there is just a slight difficulty in understanding where the previous history ends and the actual events begin again but after all this is a small matter and in no way spoils the pleasure in a singularly delightful book,juvenile_contra

the white monkey art resembles love in many ways and not least in thisthat the most complete capitulation may be the most complete conquest when a character created by a novelist imposes his wrill upon his creator the creator wins and this is what has happened to mr galsworthy it was in these columns a year ago that i wrote  mr galsworthy wanted to make soames unlovable but soames is not at all unlovable that in face of the general opinion about  the forsyte saga was a paradox but here is a sequel to  the forsyte saga and my paradoxas happens to most paradoxes if you leave them long enoughhas became a platitude before mr galsworthy while apparently with his conscious mind vilifying soames and everything that soames stood for was yet somehow compelled by artistic integrity by direct inspiration by subconscious inclination or by whatever else vou choose to call that divine something which shapes the ends of books to give soames the credit for distinction of mind and nobility of character the unintentional irony was indeed complete for in the conflict in which the saga terminated the conflict over the mutual love of fleur and jon it was soames the  man of property who behaved with sense unselfishness and generosity it was the champions of light and liberty who behaved with malignant and indeed inconceivable egotism and in  the white monkey which tells the result of that conflict and of its solutionor rather of the failure to solve itsoames at last comes openly into his own his merits seem to have risen above the threshold of his creators consciousness and are accepted golden in the light of day he is the one wholly sympathetic and admirable character in the book and perhaps it is because the presumable struggle between mr galsworthys impulse and his intention is over that the new story has an effect of lightness and clearness and at the same time of hardness and solidity like a jewelan effect which was certainly lacking in its sombre and powerful predecessors a sequel is always expected to be a failure but here is one which is a triumphant success 1 am inclined to think it is the best novel mr galsworthv has ever writtenand that is saying a good deal it has many faults but they do not matter much so great is the force of the work considered as a whole it will be remembered that  to let the concluding section of the saga proper ended with a marriage and a funeralthe marriage of fleur soamess daughter to young michael mont the funeral of the almost prehistoric timothy in  the white monkey soames fleur and michael are in the centre of the picture but neither fleur cold and restless in the disappointment of her love and her marriage with a  secondbest nor michael charming and chivalrous and inconclusive is drawn as surely as some of the minor charactersas for instance aubrey greene the artist who occurs only casually and briefly fleur is tempted to try for  experience and engages in a dangerous flirtation with wilfrid the sardonic poet her theory is that as she cannot have love she   the white monkey by john galsworthy 7s 6d net heinemann may as well have sensation but she is not  modem  enough to carry the theory into practice and anyway her immediate perplexities are shelved one cannot say solved by the opportune arrival of a baby michael is a publisher and this gives scope for some excellent satire of contemporary fashions it also provides a link with the subplot the story of bicket who is a packer for michaels firm and is dismissed for stealing he steals to get nourishing foods for his sick wife and she when she has recovered becomes an artists model to get money for him so that they can emigrate and be happy she conceals her method of raising money as he conceals his of course there is suspicion discovery and final reconciliation but this whole subplot is unnecessary and unreal on the other hand another complicating thread of excitement provided by soamess seat on the board of directors of a speculative insurance business is artistically relevant and most admirably handled nobody does directors meetings or shareholders meetings like mr galsworthy he does them very often but not too often for he makes them both thrilling and funny indeed the book is rich throughout in thrills and fun in sheer narrative energy it is amazing and the writing is of the finest galsworthy stampwith one or two almost incredible lapses how in the world does a writer of his stature and of his conscientiousness come to say that a thing  became almost a phenomenon when he means it was

but softening almost mellowing at one moment romantic coincidence strikes a serial note and admits the  bicket  idyll during which soames blows out balloons and releases them upon the night air

both are representatives of an older and wiser civilisation piquantly used in the distutbing whirl of the uppermiddle society world fleuts poet lover and her postwar husband supply the touches of passion and goodfellowship and all ends well with the redemptive baby the old proud stability and the new humanism meet in agreeable contrast upon the brink of a more adventurous and more lively

still waters new novels by the author of  dorothy 2 vols parker  son  the avriter of these volumes has aimed at depicting the moral contrast between an active impatient character and one that reposing upon a more calm and solid basis is developed by imperceptible degrees this however is only the suggested meaning of her story since she nowhere pauses to manipulate her ideas into a theory being chiefly engaged in narrating the sayings and doings of two remarkable families in a midland county of england as well as of jasper clinton an outsider destined to become the luminary of the novel though  mild as a star in water his weakness is that of pride bis heroism that of selfsacrifice but the turning point of his career is an incident adapted from the wildest melodrama jaspers father has been transported long long ago for forgery but jasper himself is an honourable youth and obtains confidential employment in a lawyers office one day he has 2001 in charge the property of the lord of dyne court where the highborn maiden of his admiration lives he disappears and the money disappears also but it is at once apparent to an attentive reader that the convict parent is at the bottom of it all and that not to enhance his fathers infamy jasper takes flight with the stigma of embezzlement upon hun all this is very theatrical and commonplace but the author has a peculiarly quiet and tasteful style which saves her from absurdity the tale is gently gracefully pleasingly told and wons the reader to an interest which at the close is not disappointed,juvenile_contra

a memoir of jane austen by her nephew j e austenleigh bentley the writer of this memoir occupies the classical post of vicar of bray how long he has held it does not appear yet as he remembers attending the funeral of his aunt more than fifty years ago we can conclude that the air of the vicarage of bray is still favourable to longevity mr austenleighs recollections of miss austen are somewhat scanty the impressions left upon the mind of seventy by the persons known at eighteen can hardly be otherwise when the favourite aunt jane of boyhood has developed after death into an admirable painter of character wheii the works which were treated half contemptuously by friends and indifferently by the public have become classics there is necessarily a greater gulf than can be measured by years all we learn of miss austen is that she was attractive in her appearance that she had a charming animated face which is faithfully reflected in the portrait prefixed to this volume and that she was a delight to children particularly to her nephews and nieces her tastes and habits were simple and homely she was not accomplished according to the present standard of accomplishments but her modesty was almost as conspicuous as her genius when we add that there were no events in her life that she was never married nor asked in marriage that she lived in total seclusion from literary society and neither knew nor corresponded with any contemporary authors we have given a summary of the materials out of which mr austenleigh has constructed this volume that he has made a pleasant sketch is under the circumstances much to his credit aud the glimpse we have of miss austen will add to the charm of her novels we have said that her personal characteristics may be summed up in a few lines not much more is told of her method of composition she wrote on a little mahogany desk in the general sittingroom where all the rest of the family were occupied and where she was liable to constant disturbance readers of  northanger abbey will remember her modest account of her own powers  the little bit two inches wide of ivory on which i work with so fine a brush as produces little effect after much labour but of this labour we hear scarcely anything it seems indeed that miss austen began to write when almost a child that before the date of her first published work she composed several tales not without merit but which she considered unworthy of publication and that  pride and prejudice was written when she was only twentyone in one of her letters she speaks of having lopt and cropt at this novel so successfully a3 to make it shorter than  sense and sensibility which though written later was published sooner something further might surely be obtained by referring to her papers many of these mr austenleigh says have been destroyed by her family but we infer from another part of his book that there are some remaining as it is internal evidence is sufficient to show that in the midst of family distractions miss austen worked up her novels to a high degree of finish currer bell speaks of this characteristic while professing herself unable to understand why miss austen was so much admired sir walter scott writes apropos of  pride and prejudice on his third perusal of it  the big bowwow strain i can do myself like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early it is a still greater pity that she met with no such appreciation as this during her life her first novel was offered to a publisher and declined by return of post the manuscript ofnorthan ger abbey was sold to a bookseller in bath for 10 and remained in his drawer for some fifteen years miss austen herself collected some of the opinions expressed by the reading public of her day and was much amused by their diversity one lady called  mansfield park a mere novel while another said its language was poor and there was nothing interesting in the characters one gentleman read the first and last chapters of emma but did not look at the rest because he had been told that it was not interesting while a lady pronounced  sense and sensibility  and  pride and prejudice downright nonsense how remarkably these opinions contrast with the judgement of macaulay who as his sister lady trevelyan informed mr austenleigh  proposed to write a memoir of miss austen with criticisms on her works to prefix it to a new edition of her novels and from the proceeds of the sale to erect a monument to her memory in winchester cathedral perhaps the most significant illustration ofthe difference between contemporary neglect and posthumous fame is to be found in the remark of the verger at winchester cathedral who was asked to show her grave  pray sir he said  can you tell me whether there was anything particular about that lady so many people want to know where she was buried almost the only tribute paid to miss austen while she was alive came from a quarter where we should least expect it the prince regent was so fond of her novels that he read them often had a set of them at each of his residences and accepted a dedication from her of his own accord his librarian too gave miss austen hints of which she could not avail herself at one time she was requested to take a clergyman of the type of beatties minstrel for her hero at another to write an historical romance illustrative of the august house of coburg in reply she avowed herself the most unlearned and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress  i must keep she said  to my own style and go on in my own way and though i may never succeed again in that i am convinced that i should totally fail in any other with all her apparent diffidence it is clear that she must have been more or less conscious of her success we see this partly in her criticism of other writers partly in her boast that she attempted to create rather than to reproduce it is a high tribute to one who did not go beyond her own sphere of life for events and characters who said in a letter that three or four families in a country village are the very thing to work on that her own relations never recognised any portraits in her novels mr austenleigh says that this was not owing to lack of opportunity for several of her acquaintances had the most tempting peculiarities and laid themselves open to caricature it certainly was not owing to want of power as we may see amongst other things from the plan of a novel according to hints from various quarters which was left amongst her papers the piece is too long to quote but its quie comedy is delicious what miss austen thought of the higher class of contemporary novels appears from the following allusion to waverley  walter scott has no business to write novels  especially good ones it is not fair he has fame and profit enough as a poet aud ought not to be taking the bread out of other peoples mouths i do not mean to like  waverley if i can help it but i fear i must i am quite determined however not to be pleased with mrs s should i ever meet with it which i hope i may not i think i can be stout against anything written by her i have made up my mind to like no novels really but miss edgeworths es and my own the pleasant appreciative irony of this passage is thoroughly characteristic of miss austen she makes herself forget for a time that her own novels have put very little bread into her mouth that she has always spoken in the humblest tone of their merits she adopts the pedestal of an aggrieved author preparing to be driven out of the field by a new comer and looking forward woefully to loss of fame and profit her real feelings on this point were as her biographer tells us cheerful and contented she received 1501 from the sale f  sense and sensibility and considered it a prodigious recompense for that which had cost her nothing it is something that miss austens genius was sufficient for herself that she was ready to delight others without caring for a reward and that she shed abroad the gifts of her bright sunny nature and never paused to ask whether they were appreciated  a memoir of jane austen c1     by her nephew j e austen leiili    j i uien xeigiu second edition to which is added lady susan and fragments o two other unfinished tales london  bentley and son in obedience to the unanimous demands of his critics both public and private mr austen leigh has now produced from the family storehouse nearly all the fragments of his aunts compositions which might reasonably be supposed to be of general interest we say nearly all because he has not published  exictso the first twelve chapters of the work on which she was engaged at the time of her death neither has he had thc courage to produce even a specimen of the many half burlesque stories written when she was little more than a child the editor is perhaps right in avoiding everything that might bear the appearance of bookmaking but our faith in his judgement is rather shaken by his having waited for encouragement from without before introducing us to lady susan and the watsons the latter fragment is quite in miss austens best manner and as it was begun in 1804 or 1805 it is not easy to account for its having been laid aside the scene is laid at the usual countrytown and the story begins with a ball where the heroine humanely dances with a little boy whose uncle we gather was ultimately to marry her the watsons are the bennets with a difference that is instead of a clever elizabeth and an amiable jane we have a goodnatured but vulgar elder sister and a heroine who is only wellbred and sensible while the other sisters are quarrelsome and underbred instead of fast and silly in miss austens hands there was therefore no danger of the work turning out a repetition of pride and prefttdice and we must therefore suppose that she was not satisfied with the plan of the story or perhaps strange as it may seem that she could not get on comfortably without a leading idea of some sort or a moral to be enforced and of this there was certainly so far no sign with lady susan the case is very different it is a study rather than a novelette and a study which there was more originality in making fifty years ago than now when dangerous heroines are so much in vogue we need scarcely say that there is no sensationalism in miss austens sketch of such a character and that she keeps strictly within the limits not merely of the possible but of the real her lady susan is a clever and attractive woman far too sensible to murder anybody and not likely even to figure in the divorce court at the same time thoroughly unprincipled but fortunately without the quite miraculous powers of deception with which later novelists would have enriched her thus it happens that the young man who is to marry her daughter escapes from her snares before it is too late while we are free to suppose that the young man whom she marries herself will be tormented and perhaps ruined but probably not poisoned or otherwise made away with the story is written in the form of letters but though that device s very well suited to a subject which turns more upon revelations of character than on incident we have not time in ninety pages to feel at home with six or seven different correspondents to the memoir itself mr austen leigh has been able to add a few more of his aunts letters of the same general character as those already published and a categorical assurance that anne elliot and fanny price were in no sense whatever the fruit of personal experience on the contrary we are told that jane declined one suitable offer in her youth and though a favourite sister thought that she might have been persuaded to marry a gentleman whom they met at the seaside if he had lived to ask her so remote a possibility cannot be supposed to have affected her subsequent happiness the cancelled chapter of persuasion in which anne and captain wentworth come to an understanding is far inferior to the one in the published work and perhaps all the more on that account helps to raise our opinion of the writer by showing that judgement had a share in her successes as well as inspiration in the first draught the eclaircissemcnt was brought about by the admirals blundering and everything was arranged so easily ind naturally that the result was rather tame the captains letter written on the spur of the moment in a crowded room gives a far more heroic turn to the conclusion though it is only in real life or miss austen that so slight an incident could pass for an event as the illustrations which accompanied the first edition of the memoir are not reproduced in the second the editor should have withdrawn the allusion p 83 to  the likeness prefixed to this volume h lawrenny  a memoir of jane austen by her nephew a j e austenleigh to which is added r lady susan and fragments of uvo other un finished tales by miss austen london saturday july io 1871 1  e literature  bentley   son a humorous critic once divided the world of letters into those who admired and those who did not admire jane austens novels nor is this fantastic division entirely without some show of reason it places on the one hand all who have the love of art for arts own sake irrespective of sentiment passion or romance it ranges on the other those who care only for art as it calls out or illustrates a certain class of feelings or ideas now of all novelists miss austen is the very last to excite any intense interest from the subjects she chooses there are no highflown characters and but little scope for imagination in her stories she is a dutch painter dealing with familiar homely scenes and very ordinary people  but then how admirable her touches and how true the picture  give her a group of commonplace men and women in a stupid english village and her art makes them all alive and we count them henceforth among our own friends and acquaintances it is an art which seems half marvellous it is like that of the great french cook who wanted only an old kid glove out of which to make the most exquisite of volauvents but the great literary artists are her warmest admirers southey declared her more true to nature than any other of his age macaulay proposed to write her life and reedit all her novels coleridge was loud in her praise and guizot speaks of the pleasure he owed to her sir walter scott asserted that she  had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful i ever met with but we have still stronger because quite unconscious testimony to the hold these novels have taken on very cultivated and gifted minds without a trace of plagiarism without a thought of imitation on their part we see the impression which miss austen has left on novelists as unlike herself as well can be they may probably have never remembered at the time nor ever suspected afterwards how much they were indebted to her but nevertheless the debt must have been incurred did any one ever read  the small house at allington and fail to recall at once barton cottage in  sense and sensibility   there is the park and there is the great housethere are the widow and the two girlsthere is the lovemaking and the faithless lover the surroundings of the story are the same and much of the story itself a still more striking illustration is furnished by lady georgiana fullerton never could two writers less resemble each other than the  author of emma and the author of grantley manor they are unlike in style in temper in motive the one is a restrained and careful artist quickly working out her subject with no purpose beyond it the other is an earnest impulsive writer who has aims quite independent of the evolution of the story itself the impressions left by the two novels are entirely different and yet who can believe apart of course from some distinct denial that  grantley manor would ever have been written had  emma never been read  there are differences and contrasts enough but the main thread of the story is precisely the same when emma receives jane fairfax into the house and more than half falls in love with frank churchill then finds out the mysterious understanding between her lover and her friend and finally marries old mr knightley as the best thing left for her to do she is but rehearsing the part which falls to margaret in the later novel there jane fairfax becomes ginevra edmund neville takes the place of frank and old walter steps in at the right moment to marry the young heroine turning now to the book before us we need not speak about miss austens life of which the first part consists as we reviewed it when it first came out it has now been enlarged and improved and though still somewhat slight is well and pleasantly written but the real interest of this volume consists in the unpublished fragments of jane austens writings there is a chapter ofpersuasion which was afterwards cancelled there are the first rough notes of the story she was writing when she died there is a short but complete story lady susan which is believed to have been an early production lastly there is the unfinished beginning of a novel to which the editor has given the name of  the watsons of course these fragments must be taken for what they are worth it was a natural wish on her nephews part that nothing of his aunts writing should be lost and so he has gathered together what he could but the responsibility is his alone and as he says censure if any  must fall on him who put it forth not on her who kept it locked up in her desk certainly jane austen would never have allowed anything incomplete or less good than her best to see the light still if these remains have not the literary value which attaches to her finished works they have nevertheless a value and an interest of their own they are only sketches but we draw them out from the portfolio of a great artist and find in them all that masterly touch which scarcely any other could have given even the cancelled chapter of persuasion the place of which was afterwards better supplied we should have been unwilling to lose as for the story on which she was engaged when the pen fell from her hand for ever it gave promise of ranking with her best novels the scene is laid at a little village on the sussex coast which two great proprietors are anxious to turn into a fashionable bathingplace one of these is an enthusiastic mr parker who believed that seaair and seabathing together were nearly infallible  nobody could catch cold by the sea nobody wanted appetite by the sea  nobody wanted spirits  nobody wanted strength they were healing softening relaxing fortifying and bracing seemingly just as was wantedsometimes one sometimes the other if the seabreeze failed the seabath was the certain corrective and when bathing disagreed the seabreeze was evidently designed by nature for the cure the other proprietor is a greedy old widow a large boardingschool is expected at the village and she remarks ah well no harm in that they will stay their six weeks and out of such a number who knows but some may be consumptive and want asses milk and ive two milch asses at this very time if only the story could have been finished what fun we should all have had with this old lady denham and mr parker and the invalid miss parker of whom her sister writes  she has accordingly had three teeth drawn and is decidedly better but her nerves are a good deal deranged she can only speak in a whisper and fainted away this morning on poor arthurs trying to suppress a cough  lady susan though complete in itself is otherwise of less real value than either of the unfinished stories it is in the form of letters which is an obvious disadvantage though formerly it was a method of telling a story which was much in vogue in spite however of sir charles grandison and of evelina miss austen herself distrusted its effect she recast sense and sensibility which was originally written in this form and she suppressed lady susan altogether the narrative instead of flowing easily and naturally along is given in a succession of jerks as now one and now another letterwriter takes up the tale it is difficult moreover so to vary the style apart from the substance of the letters as to give to each writer his own distinctive character and miss austen is less successful in lady susan than we had a right to expectfor when was ever letter written like that of mr collinss in  pride and prejudice nor is this story itself a pleasant one lady susan is a widow of doubtful reputation who is never happy except when engaged in a series of flirtations her young daughter is terribly in her way and she must marry her offhand a sir james martin is chosen as her husband but the man is a fool and the unfortunate girl detests him and will fall in love with a certain reginald de courcy meanwhile lady susan herself keeps up a sentimental flirtation with de courcy and at the same time a very violent flirtation with a married mr mainwaring de courcy fortunately discovers this double dealing and marries the daughter instead of the mother while lady susan stepping into her daughters place contents herself with sir james all this half rivalry between mother and daughter is disagreeable enough and lady susan is simply odious in spite of her beauty tact and fascination no woman however of her crafty and experienced worldliness could write so openly and so atrociously as does lady susan not only has she no disguises from herself but she affects none when writing to her friend and confidante here are two amiable examples of this excellent lady   my dear alicia in what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age just old enough to be formal ungovernable and to have the gout too old to be agreeable too young to die and again  mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever and were we at liberty i doubt if i could resist even matrimony offered by him thib event if his wife live with you it may be in your power to hasten the violence of her feelings which must wear her out may be easily kept in irritation i rely on your friendship for this but if we care little for  lady susan we care very much for  the watsons what we have of it was written in a moment of gay and happy inspiration why it was never finished it is difficult to imagine mr austenleigh suggests that  the author became aware of the evil of having placed her heroine too low in such a position of poverty and obscurity as though not necessarily connected with vulgarity has a sad tendency to degenerate into it and therefore like a singer who has begun on too low a note she discontinued the strain but surely this cannot have been the reason the watsons are at least as good as the bennets and tom musgrave is immeasurably superior to john thorpe as for the heroine herself she is more charming than elizabeth bennet or fanny price or catherine morland or any of miss austens heroines anne elliott alone excepted we suspect the real reason of this story remaining unfinished may have been that tom musgrave was too real a character and she shrank from what she would call  an invasion of social proprieties certainly tom mus grave if not taken from life is one of her most lifelike and vigorous creations the spoiled dandy of a country town with his insufferable conceit to thc equals who flatter him and lls unblushing toadyism to his betters who endure him he is simply glorious the ball at the hotel where he will not deign to appear till the osbornes come and from which he must retire when the osbornes go is capitally described and then what can be more delightful than his astonishment when emma refuses to dance with him or his disgust when she declines a seat in his curricle or his bewildered surprise when she will not admire lord osborne  he spends an evening with the watsons and condescends to play vingtetun with them  the favourite game at osborne castle and keeps them well supplied with anecdotes  the ways and good jokes of osborne castle were now added to his ordinary means of entertainment he repeated the smart sayings of one lady detailed the oversights of another and indulged himself even with a copy of lord osbornes overdrawing himself on both cards the clock 3truck nine while he was thus agreeably employed and when nanny came in with her masters basin oi gruelwas the father of emma watson we conder as particular about the thinness of his gruel as though father of emma woodhouse  he had the pleasure of observing to mr watson that he should now leave him at supper while he went home to dinner himself the carriage was ordered to the door and no entreaties for his staying longer could now avail for he well knew that if he stayed he would have to sit down to supper in less than ten minutes which to a man whose heart had been long fixed on calling his next meal a dinner was quite insupportable it is tantalising to feel that we can never know tom musgraves fate did he marry into the osborne set or fall a victim to some intriguing barmaid  the more painful  nd is we fear the more strictly probable this book then possesses singular aud varied interest it is well edited and carefully arranged to one thing only we must demur on behalf of some unsuspecting reader considering that  lady susan comprises only 88 pages out of 364 that the greater part of the book is the alreadypublished life we doubt whether the name lady susan c on the back fairly represents its contents we would commend the matter to either editor publisher or both as a case of conscience for them to ktiacide  a memoir of jane austen by her nephew j e austenleigh vicar of bray berks london bentley 1870 sense and sensibilitya novel by jane austen new edition london  bentley 1870 in the same sense that keats is the poets poet miss austen has always been far excellence the favourite author of literary men the peculiar merits of her style are recognised by all but with the general mass of readers they have never secured what can fairly be called popularity the technical dexterity of her workmanship is best appreciated by fellow craftsmen and some education of the literary palate is needed to do full justice to the delicate execution and subtle analytic power which give the author of emma an unassailable place amongst english classics it has always been known that miss austens private life was unruffled by any of the incidents or passions which favour the trade of the biographer  had it been otherwise the circle of her admirers fit if comparatively few would never have consented to wait half a century for the meagre but still interesting details which her nephew mr austenleigh has now made public it fits in with our idea of the authoress to find that she was a proficient in the microscopic needlework of sixty years since that she was never in love that she  took to the garb of middle age earlier than her years or her looks required and that she excelled in telling stories for children the few extracts given from her letters have the additional recommendation of illustrating the rise of the modern novel and the school of realistic fiction which fanny burney had announced though not founded at present the difficulties against which miss austens novels have to contend are the sententiously moral titles of pride and prejudice sense and sensibility the lengthy moral dissertations which the characters allow themselves and the consequent delay in developing the story the authoress on the other hand writes impartially of pride and prejudice  it wants shade it wants to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense if it could be had if not of solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story an essay on writing a critique on walter scott or the history of buonaparte or something that would form a contrast and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness and epigrammatism of the general style it would be difficult to ignore more completely the origin and the tendencies of her success but the passage shows the difficulties she had to overcome in the form of a preconceived theory the critics of the day were equally in the dark and one reviewer allows no merit to sense and sensibility but what arises from the exemplary behaviour of the elder sister it was not till after miss austens time that the domestic novel was emancipated from the theories of the amusing and the doctrines of the edifying which chill and stiffen miss edgeworths talent she was not conscious herself of founding a new school of fiction which would inspire new canons of criticism and in the mean time since she left tales of thrilling adventure to radcliffs and porters she could only claim a literary locus standi as a wit a satirist or a moralist to all of which characters she had of course a right though neither of them includes all the qualities with which we should credit her works these there can be little doubt would have been more popular now if the morality had been taken for granted and as much reliance placed upon dramatic and narrative truthfulness as upon the polished satire and the slight though pure thread of humour which runs through every work as a matter of art miss austens novels are more perfect than thackerays but they are far from containing as many separate excellencies  and her per feet command of the materials she possessed seems to warrant the belief that a wider experience of men and things would have enriched without corrupting her style as it isr she stands nearly alone amongst novelists in drawing men and women with equal success by the help of follies and weaknesses slight enough not to reduce their victims below the level of mediocrity mr austenleigh explains as a pure misrecollection the unaccountable secondhand description of his aunt found in miss mitfords correspondence since her mother on whose authority it was given is proved to have known jane austen only as a little girl the biographers task has been performed with care and judgment though certainly with less spirit than macaulay would have thrown into the memoir he once thought of writing the scantiness of the correspondence is however to be regretted and few specimens of unpublished writings would have added to the interest of the work thus where a wellknown passage like the end of persuasion exists in an earlier and less perfect form it is for the credit of the author that we should have an opportunity of comparing the two the new edition of the novels which is coming out does not appear before it is needed but the paper and type are hardly worthy of a series which is only introduced into libraries where an honourable place has been reserved for it h lawrenny,juvenile_contra

  the siege of lady be solute by harris dickson harper  brothers mk dicksons reinforcement of the historic romance which has recently had such a run in america is ineffective work though care and conviction have evidently gone to its composition it lacks vitality or any distinction of style but contains some popular qualities for here is due compliment of duels  to the death hot pursuits and hairbreadth escapes the heroine moreover steels her heart in the approved fashion for heroines of this order of fiction to prolong up to the very last page her lovers punishment for an early and promptly repeated lapse of loyalty the scene is laid mainly in france in the latter and less lustrous days of the fourteenth louis and a few historical figures make a rather feeble appearance madame de maintenon is utilized allowably enough in her traditional character of cold and scheming devote as an evil genius of the plot the author is happier among the mississippi forests whither the demands of the action transplant most of the dramatis persona half way through the tale than he is in a french chateau the weakest point of this book is its poor suggestion of atmosphere the historical novelist is seldom altogether successful in safely steering his dialogue between the scylla of stiltedness and the charybdis of anachronistic colloquialism such expressions however as  slipping around mad sc angry what are you coming at quit work right here c in france of the eighteenth century certainly tend to destroy what there is of illusion,juvenile_contra
  the hazelhurst mystery the harelhurrt mysteiy a novel by jessie sale lloyd in two volumes london  tinsley brothers a short time ago writing of a socalled romance in three volumes we expressed a doubt whether it could be surpassed for folly and offence unlikely as it seemed the doubt has been resolved by our becoming acquainted with though socalled novel now before us which within its two volumes contains to the full as much silliness and vulgarity as did the three volnmes of the other production  while as the author has dared to fall back upon though most wellworn ticcues on which novel puppets have been strung for the last twenty years it may fairly be said to be even more commonplace its commonplaceness is indeed soextraordinary that it verges on genius let any experienced novelreader take the materials of which  the hazelhurst mystery  is compounded and we will back him at long odds to serve them np in a less appallingly inane and flaccid mess than has been made of them given a lonely and lovely girl married to a worthy young man for whom she has no passionate love a meddling aunt of the girls and a fashionable doctor as handsome and insinuating as was though fabled dogsmeat man who is the intimate friend of the worthy husband and there is already matter enough to make a thrilling if not a very edifying romance miss lloyd however has clearly shrunk in tenor before the possible strength of her ingredient and lest their flavour should bs too violent ha bhitsci them in such fashion that she has produced a far mon nauseous mess than the most sincerely immoral frencik writer could have manufactured mrs george grafton the lovely being of whom we have spoken falls in love soon after her marriage with harry cartland the insinuating wretch of a doctor and he of course can do not less than fall in love with her but his love is not revealed until one fatal evening  up tc now he had never for one moment believed that she cared for himhad indeed no reason for thinking anything but the right and proper thought that she loved her husband george grafton but now    therewasasoffc ness in her face about her lips that he had never seen beforethe something that had been wanting was there now  and kate was not only handsome but beautifult this was too good an opportunity for making love ta his greatest friends wife to be lost and he naturally leaned over her saying  kate  kate   we read that on this her eyes filled with tears and love and that the pair were  on the brink of temptation but fortunately at that moment george came in and kate like  wellconducted person flew into his arms only for a time however was this to endure george with the prudence that should of right belong te an honest husband resolves on going over to ceylon alone to look after his business and says to cartland if i go harry you will see her constantly and watch her as carefully as if she were your own yon will promise it is needless to say that the sly wretch of a doctor does promise and does watch over kate as carefully as if she were his own so carefully indeed that he ends by making her his own not however in the way in which things would happen in a shocking french novel but by what she takes for lawful marriage after the supposed death of george but here let it be noted that before she fancied grafton to be dead she had  put her arms about cartland her lips on his fevered brow and said several times that she loved him she was careful however to add  when i cease tobe his i am yours love while he lives never theseremarkable scenes took place in cartlands private rooms in london whither kate had accompanied him shortly afterwards he persuaded her that george was dead and the very next day they were married meanwhile the wily cartland had found a dying girl very like kate and when was she dead sent her off in a coffin inscribed with mrs graftons name to mrs graftons house by means of this simple device grafton away in ceylon was persuaded that his wife was dead he took the news of her death however less coolly than she did that of his and was indeed so true toiler memory that although a charming girl was saved with him from a wreck on purpose to fall in love with him he utterly refused to marry her until public opinion decided that unless he did so she could not continue to live in his house which she distinctly declined toquit however they were married and had an infant son and lived very happily until george with his usual idiotcy came straight back to england because his first wifes meddling aunt reported to him with no evidence to back her statement that kate was still alive having ascertained that this was indeed the fact and fathomed the depth of cartlands villany he refused to have anything more to do with the woman he had as he thought married in ceylon because for her to stay with him longer would be a sin his noble soul never conceived the possibility of keeping the matter secret from her about which there would have been no difficulty the fitting climax to this string of hideou rubbish is that kate having gone mad for a time recovers to be affectionately tended by her successor and while the two are talking religious platitudes which are under the circumstances only less offensive than those uttered by cartland on his deathbed george enters george graftonfor it was henever forgot that sight his two wives  it would have been surprising if he had kate immediately dies and george marries the other wife again next day what became of the unfortunate child born before this second and legal marriage we do not hear we should not have been at the pains of noticing such stuff as  the hazelhurst mystery but for its being an attempt to give to a revolting story au aspect of goodiness which is infinitely sickening we may give as an instance of this the deathbed of cartland already referred to when this excessively wicked person wras dying  kate fell upon her knees holding the almost dead hands and breathed that blessed promise into the failing ears of the dying man who had lived an unbeliever  and she saw that he believed at last for a glorious smile of intelligence passed across his ashenhued facelending a beauty even to death itselfand all was still out of evil good may come  and the fact that such stories as this are written by women with nothing better to do may

ftb d3rib comic tales and shetches by mr michael angelo titmarsh although these tales and sketches have already appeared in two of our leading periodicals they will be received as rich and racy additions to our comic literature which is of paramount attraction at the present moment this diversion of the public taste may be a reaction in parliamentary phrase we suspect that the reading classes or in one word everybody have become so weary of the utilitarian bores and their neverending nevermending doctrines that a leap from grave to gay has been eagerly and generally taken and probably more improvement may be effected by the light artillery of satiric humour than by the sappers and miners in  the march of intellect for men are more likely to be laughed out of their follies by true humour than to be worried out of them by dulness mr tiitmarsh ranks very high in if not at the head of the english school of wits as we observed in noticing his paris sketch book d he has a very nice percept tion of the ridiculous and a talent for raillery which would hale delighted even the great lord shaftesbury who maintains that nothing is proof against raillery but what is honest and just this rare talent is here admirably worked out as every page and plate of these two volumes testifies for titmarsh is his own illustrator as well as editor at the duties of the latter he glances in his preface wherein he commends the publishers custom of causing the works of unknown literary characters to be  edited by some already popularperson a custom which cannot be too strongly praised both by authors of high repute and by writers of no repute at all for the former pocket the publishers drafts and the latter their meed of fame but the literal illustration is still more amusing this little editorial fiction is one which can do harm to nobody in the world and only good to the youngauthor so introduced for who would notice him in such a great crowded bustling world unless he came providedwith a decent letter of recommendation thus captain peter simple brought forward the ingenious writer of  rattlin the reefer  thus mr william harrison rookwood took dr bird by the hand thus the famous mr theodore eye lately patronised the facetious peter priggins whose elegant tales of oxford life munst have charmed many thousand more persons than ever will read this  preface take one more instance the history of needlework in all ages a book of remarkable interest and exciting to a delirious pitch many people now would have passed over the book altogether who when

footman of mr yellowplushs distinction he is be assured a very faithful chronicler of his ladies and gentlemen for he was  some time footman in many genteel families from all of whom he received an excellent character for honesty and sobriety besides we would ask who can so well recount the private histories of  their betters as their servants and who are so fit to become their biographers  true it is that all are not equally gifted yellowplush may not like dodsley be a muse in livery nor be mistaken by his maxims for lord chesterfield nor may he in these degenerate days meet with such a

life in sweden with excursions in norway and denmark by selina bunbury 2 vols hurst  blackett when we were speaking of the belligerent and inconsolable mrs herveys travels in kashmir we characterised the present as an age of  odd female travellers miss bunburys book does not tempt us to withdraw the epithetthough it must be forthwith added that her curiosities of travel are of a more quaint and feminine order than those of the oriental tourist miss bunbury exhibits herself as bustling curious sentimental resolute to see and not averse to be seenin a manner calculated to suggest whimsical thoughts of the impression which her solitary appearance must have produced in circles wherein the travelled englishwoman is a rarity our authoress appears avowedly to have announced herself as travelling with a view to publication and to have got on in a fashion sufficiently unique let us take an instance at randomwhile waiting in christiania for an j eclipse it occurred to miss bunbury that she  would improve the interval by taking a run into the country never having learned to drive j herself in a carriole and feeling that a solitary expedition in a strange land of which she could not speak the language might be unsafe as well as conspicuousshe met willingly a proposition made by those whom she consulted that she should hire a divinity student on the point of taking orders to drive her and to keep her company the narrative shall be continued in her own words the tomorrow came i could scarcely sleep from excitement however having my travels before me i tried to make a good breakfast every book of travels in the north i had read asserted that in these regions one might always calculate on good eggs so eggs i always have ordered hitherto in the hotel de scandinavie

and will attend you then i must go on the road to bergen very well it is the most  beautiful road i will go for him now and return  in half an hourwhat easy resources they have i here  i said to myself in three or four hours the i professor returned i should have come sooner i he said but the lieutenant has now promised to i accompany a blind man who has come to see our country and a promise to a blind man you know must be kept before one to a lady  perhaps  yesbefore one to a lady who has eyes but no matter i have another plan much more suited to you yes this you will say is the very

childhood  j  and i shall share it yes he will drive and if  you wish to draw draw what the carriole  j  ack nay he is going to collect fairylegends  and if you wish towhat do you call it in english

no that cannot be native art and literature only  are encouraged here the government sends this  fairyhunter and has already paid him for his  legends and sends him on his tour free oh  dear no

reverence he spoke in english and said very slowly  i complain of you much that you are so dis t agreeable but now i make an extra i made my r i last reverence in reply such a speech by way of a i i complimentary one was rather startling and not a s j little alarming i looked nervously at the professor who with profound gravity interpreted his friends meaning thushe pities you for being so disagreeably circumstanced  but he is making an abridgment of his book and therefore cannot now make his tour i bowed with a sense of relief and the 1 j fairyhunter and myself exchanged some sentences e i which i do not record as i believe the fairies alone 0 would be nble to understand the language  i have e  got another plan for you said the professor  yes this is the very thing a teacher of music here wishes to take his wife and child into the country and one of our operavoices who also speaks italian which you do likewisewill go with them they will all join you  but as they must leave their affairs here they expect you will pay all the travelling expenses they will bring their own provisions because there are none to be got on the road that is fair  very fair indeed i answered  the very thing i complain of you much  murmured the fairyhunter looking at me compassionately you must then take n carriage said the professor it will be quite filled i replied four persons with norsecloaks pipes tobaccopouches provisions and luggage and the child  added my professor 4 ah  i suppose i must take it on my knee you are very disagreeable said the fairyhunter with a look of commiseration at me but i thought secretly that others were still more disagreeable  but mr murrays handbook says it is dangerous to take a heavy carriage over the hills of norway and certainly a roll down among such et ceteras would not be pleasant i added herr fairyhunter moved uneasily on his chair worked his hands together shook his head disprovingly and said you must he complained of miss

board that boat was a poor little frenchwoman the wife of a professor of paris without any sort of cloak or defence against it i gave her part of mine and made her put her feet at the open door of the

agriculture produce manufactures eve c how long had he been in sweden  i asked nearly six weeks she answered this seems indeed a favourite time for authors visits   the whole passage on the lake to

the nearly total absence of what are called here curiously enough leaftreesthat i all trees that bear leaves in summer and not in winter gives a monotonous and rather heavy air to the banks which is only occasionally diversified by the appearance of such fine places as skokloster and if such be the case at all times it may be supposed what it was on a dark rainy and bitterly cold day we landed however and got to an hotel and were given an immense room with a couple of sofas in it which at night were opened and the treasures they contained were taken out anti laid upon them and so your sofa is turned into your bed and your sittingroom into your steeping room with very little ado and the evening was so wet that i stayed in the house and tried to persuade myself i was in upsala   when i went out of the hotel on a sunshiny morning i went about and about and said where is upsala and my companion said  you are in it and i answered no i am in a clean modern goodlooking town of new wooden houses painted or coloured in all colours chiefly red the streets are wide very wide indeed and the whole thing looks as if it had sprung up in a night by the work of a few carpenters hands there is an old orangecoloured castle partly in ruins up there on a great elevation from whence you see interminably around over one vast plain unbroken almost by a tree the widest barest most uninteresting scene i ever beheld there is an immense brick cathedral deformed by swedish taste in renovation standing in an open space there are multitudes of men young and middle aged walking everywhere about with cigars or pipes in their mouths and hideous boys caps of white jean on their heads and no other academic dress whenever they get together in groups or set out on their favourite annual tours they sing a great deal make much noise and generally act rather rudely these are the students miss bunbury passed a winter in stockholm as the lodger of a countesswho instructed her benignantly on the

little adornment which nature herself had bestowed upon my head by wearing the plumes more lavishly bestowed on other creatures without being guilty of usurping the honours of matrimony i felt it necessary to make the most of my natural advantages by calling in the aid of a hairdresser kccolleering having seen a shop of that description kept by a frenchman from paris somewhere about bruukehcrg i thought there was no ditliculty in the way and asking froken to accompany me on a walk i went out intending to make this matter its object the shop proved to he a perfumery ami fancy tttionery one also there was a woman only therein who when i asked for monsieur said she was his wile and supposed she would do as well i replied no for i wanted him to come to dress my hair  not your own hair she said in a solemn and questioning manner certainly my own hairon your headcertainly on my own head can i see him the good woman looked at me with a face that plainly said what an audaciously hardened creature this must be to make such a proposal then abruptly saying  he is absent he is in paris he is very ill in bed she turned her back and looked up at the articles on her shelf i went away on our road i saw a sign with  pcrukmakare upon it and before froken could stop nie i entered the shop there was a man here  is it to make a peruke he inquired  no to come to dress my hair the poor man seemed to undergo a convulsion to avoid laughter then he looked so awkward i think he blushed but i looked out and saw froken standing with a very pretty face of perfect distress in the street madame madame she cried at the door when i appeared that is impossible that we can ask for a hairdresser in stockholm pray madame come home i want to be at home i went home with the poor girl thinking only that it is very unpleasant for any one not interested in an object to go about thus on an unpleasant day looking for what is not easily found a few minutes after we entered the house i followed froken to the salong and found my hostess leaning her back against the kakelugn or stove and laughing most heartily while froken stood before with a halfashamed halfrelieved countenance evidently in the act of confession  yes madame cried the former interrupting her laugh to speak to me and taking it up again yes i am telling her that is not so dangerous and the laugh recommencedwhatto ask for a hairdresser that there was some infection going which such persons were in danger of conveying i was now quite convinced but when i simply asked if this were the case a roar of laughter echoed through the great room it brought out some young ladies to see if what was going on were roliga word i think oftener used in the swedish language than in any other certainly oftener than we use its english expletiveamusing but to see all the modest faces that were put to the blush when they heard that madame had actually been inquiring for a hairdresser  well said the hostess at last it is not wonderful that madame should do so for in my younger days it was not thought improper to employ a man to dress hair improper i cried opening my eyes as a new light dawned on them and that good wifes shocked expression of face reappeared before themimproper why in england where propriety is very much thought of and in france too that is an everyday occurrence1 yes yes that is not dangerous and that i find quite a foolish idea though it is our custom said our hostess for once in her life giving up the perfection and immutability of swedish ways  it was not so in my youth no when i was in the world it was not improper to have a hairdresser the ladies ran away and i asked the elder one in private what it was that constituted this impropriety that is just what i cannot well say she replied but no lady here would have a man to dress her hair they have women who are taught to do so but these women are taught by men yes but man kan inte hjelpe det the fact is it is a ladys propriety but not a womans that is shocked by employing a male hairdresser i remarked it is our custom madame but i grant you i do not think it a wise one for it was not thought dangerous when i was in the world forty years agobut how can it be so now  whyyou know he must go into the ladies apartments yes but men often do so here at all times and sit and talk there with them yes but you know their toilet is not complete when their hair is to be dressedbut propriety is much more outraged when it is complete i answered man kan inte hjelpe det said the noble dame and ran off to the kitchen the above extracts will suffice to give the reader a fairand we think a not unpleasant idea of miss bunburys book she is not so much wanting in good nature ns wanting in taste she possesses the power of observation in larger proportion than the faculty of selection a sledge accident which confined her to the house made her the object of affectionate ministration on the part of miss bremerto whose thoughtful and

  the countess eve this new volume by the author of john inglesant is notable for romantic pietism and is very orthodox in tone the  dear ola devil as emerson in one of his most genial moods calls him hovers around the principal people of the story in the form of a polite french abbe the author seems to wish to impress upon his readers the idea that the world is full of ghosts and spirits both good and evil but the human figures in his story are almost as shadowy and unreal as the ghosts themselves   the countess eve by john shorthouse macmillan the countess eve for instance is described as having  rich chestnut hair and deep violet eyes and upon this slender basis we are left to build up for ourselves the  mysteriously lovely creature she is said to be la valliere the actor  his friend le brie the abbess  and the other persons of the little drama are sketched in the same vague way poor monsieur de brie being such a shadowy sketch of a man naturally falls senseless on being confronted with a good solid ghost which he thus describes  u it seemed to me that i saw a vision  a foul and terrible visionas far as words can faintly image what i saw ghastly with the horrors of the charnel house and the grave with all the foulness of corruption and with all the horror of despaira figure gaunt with the terrors of a skeleton and the gruesome pallor of a shroud   one had hoped that this rather theatrical literary property in charnel houses graveyards and gruesome pallid shrouds had gone out of fashion  or that a poetical mind like that of the author of  sir percival would have scorned the use of such old bogie material but it seems to be a natural law that if a writer does not put some reality into his human figures where it is required it will go into his ghosts who are better without it that there is a serious purpose running through the book doubtless the readers of john inglesant will discover a very transcendental critic might see this in the different forms in which the devil is made to appear to different people  but as his most repulsive shape is shown to the pious le brie while the lightminded la vallifcre sees nothing worse than a withering face lashed with stripes of burning steel it is difficult for an ordinary mind to fix upon the precise moral intended by the author one cannot help feeling that a little more nature in his human figures would serve the authors purpose if his aim is to make his readers realise the existence of a spiritual world it is the commonplace reality of nature that lends such startling contrast to the unseen and invisible world a world so strangely different from all we are familiar with and accustomed to mr shorthouse will have to go deeper into the human soul as it is in its common phases before he can sound the depths of that region where even shakespeare himself hardly dares to tread,juvenile_contra

  the cruise of the shining light by norman duncan harper  brothers this is distinctly the most ambitious and we think the best book that mr duncan has written whether he is conscious of it or not he owes much to stevenson but the matter is original and the whole is entertaining despite the fact that the author overdoes such locutions as  the boy that was i  to an extent which sometimes becomes irritating the scene of the tale is the windswept icebound coast of labrador yet it is full too of glowing creature comfort and has something of the robust atmosphere of treasure island the situation upon which the book hinges is quaintly fantastic and good material for a romantic story a fisherman with rude notions of heaven and hell and christianity has pledged himself to bring up as a gentleman a certain lad whose father was lost at sea his method of carrying out this task with of course a subsequent sentimental development forms the story it is a pleasant book and its moral is sound,juvenile_contra

its cheese and the woman who counted her egga before they were hatched but there is always plasure in seeing how old friends like these are dressed up and most of the stories will be altogether new to all but a very few readers the most pathetic story in the series is one telling how a certain count having been stricken with leprosy for defaming his wife was tended through all his degradation by three faitgful knights too loyal to allow their disapproval of his crime to interfere with their chivalrous devotion and how in the end they were rewarded for their labours here is a good story of a different sort three impostors came to a xing and told him they were clothweavers and could fabricate a cloth of so peculiar a nature that a legitimate son of his father could see the cloth but if he were illegitimate though believed to be legitimate he could not see it now the king was much pleased at this thinking that by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed fathers from those who were not and so be enabled to increase his treasures for among the moors only legitimate children inherit their fathers property and for this end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture of this cloth and these men in order to convince him that they had no intention of deceiving him agreed to be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured which satisfied the king  when they were supplied with a large quantity of gold silver silk and many other things they entered the palace and putting their looms in order gave it to be understood that they were working all day at the cloth  after some days one of them came to the king and told him the cloth was commenced that it was the most curious thing in the world describing the design and construction he then prayed the king to favour him with a visit but begged he would come alone the king was much pleased but wishing to have the opinion of some one first sent the lord chamberlain to see it in order to know if they were deceiving him when the lord chamberlain saw the workmen and heard all they had to say he dared not admit he could not see the cloth and when he returned to the king he stated that he had seen it the king sent yet another who gave the same report when they whom he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth he determined to go himself  on entering the palace and seeing the men at work who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of the invention as also the design and colour in which they all appeared to agree although in reality they were not working when the king saw how they appeared to work and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described and yet could not see it although those he had sent had seen it he began to feel very uneasy fearing he might not be the son of the king who was supposed to be his father and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he might lose his kingdom under this impression he commenced praising the fabric describing its peculiarities after the manner of the workmen  on the teturn to his palace he related to his people how good and marvellous was the cloth yet at the same time suspected something wrong at the end of two or three days the king requested his alguacil or officer of justice to go and see the cloth when the aglacil entered and saw the workmen who as before describod the figures and pattern of the cloth knowing that the king  had been to see it and yet could not see it himself he thought he certainly could not be the legitimate son of his father and therefore could not see it ile however feared if he was to declare that he could not see it he would lose his honourable position to avoid this mischance he dmmenced praising the cloth even more vehemently than the others  when the aiguacil returned to the king and told him that he had seen the cloth and that it was the most extraordinary production in the world the king was much disconcerted for he thought that if the al acil had seen the cloth which he was unable to see there cold 1o longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of the king as was generally supposed he therefore did not hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill of the workmen who were able to make it on another day he sent one of his councillors and it happened to him as to the king and the others of whom i have spoken and in this manner and for this reason they deceived the ing and many others for no one dared to say he could not see the cloth things went on thus until there came a great feast when all requested the king to be dressed in some of the cloth so the workmen being ordered brought some rolled up in very fine linen and inquired of the king how much of it he wished them to cut l off so the king gave orders how much and how to make it up  now when the clothes were made and the feast day had arrived the weavers brought them to the king informing his maesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he had directed the sing all this time not dating to say he coild not see it  when the king had professed to dres himself in this suit he mounted on horseback and rode into the city but fortunately for him it was sumner time the people aeeing his majesty come 1 in thismanner were much surprised but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers kept their surprise to themselves fearing the dishonour consequent upon such a declaration not so however i with a negro who happened to notice

patronio  a moorwho was much r respected 4nd who had a son the most promising youth in the world but not being rich enough to accomplish the great deeds which he felt in his heart equal to he was greatly troubled having x the will and not the power l now in the same town there lived another moor who held a r higher position and was very much richer than his father and 3 who had an only daughter the very reverse in character and appearance of the young man she being of so very violent a temper that no one could be found willing to marry such a virago b one day the young man came to his father and said you r know that your means will not allow you to put me in a position r to live honourably adding that as he desired to live an easy and i quiet life he thought it better to seek to enrich himself by an advantageous marriage or to leave that part of the country the father told him that he would be very happy if he could e succeed in such a union on this the son proposed if it were e agreeable to his father to seek the daughter of their neighbour in e marriage hearing this the father was much astonished and t asked how he could think of such a thing when he knew that no man however poor could be induced to marry her 8 nevertheless the son insisted and although the father 1 thought it a strange whim in the end he gave his consent the d good man then visited his neighbour telling him the wish of his a son i when the good man heard what his friend said he answered  by heaven my friend were i to do such a thing i should prove t myself a very false friend for you have a worthy son and it would i be base in me to consent to his injury or death and i know for cer tain that were he to live with my daughter he would soon lie or death at least would be preferable to life do not think i say t this from any objection to your alliance for i should only be too r grateful to any man who would take her out of my house the young mans father was much pleased at this as his son was so intent on the marriage all being ultimately arranged l they were in the end married and the bride taken home according i to the moorish fashion to the house of her husband and left to i supper the friends and relations returning to their respective homes waiting anxiously for the following day when they feared to find the bridegroom either dead or seriously injured  now being left alone the young couple sat down to supper i when the bridegroom looking behind him saw his mastiff and said to him  bring me water wherewith to wash my hands the dog naturally taking no notice of this command the young man t became irritated and ordered the animal more angrily to bring him water for his hands which the latter not heeding the young man arose in a great rage and drawing his sword commenced a savage attack on the dog who to avoid him ran away but l finding no retreat jumped on the table then to the fireplace his master still pursuing him who having caught him first cut off his head then his paws hewing him to pieces covering everything r with blood thus furious and bloodstained he returned to the l table and looking round saw a cat  bring me water for my hands said he to him the animal not noticing the command the master cried out  how false traitor did you not see how i treated i the mastiff for disobeying me if you do not do as i tell you this  instant you shall share his fate the poor little harmless cat i continuing motionless the master seized him by the paws and r dashed him to pieces against the wall his fury increasing he again placed himself at the table looking about on all sides as if i for something to attack next his wife seeing this and supposing i he had lost his senses held her peace at length he espied his horse the only one he had and called to him fiercely to bring him i water to wash his hands the animal not obeying he cried out l in a rage  how is this think you that because you are the only horse i have that you dare thus to disobey my orders know then that your fate shall be the same as the others and that anyone living who dares to disobey me shall not escape my yengence saying this he seized the horse cut off his head and hacked him to pieces and when the wife saw this and knowing he had no other horse felt that he was really in earnest she became dreadfully alarmed he again sat down to table raging and all bloody as he was swearing he would kill a thousand horses or even men or women if they dared to disobey him holding at the same time his bloody sword in his hand he looked around with glaring eyes until fixing them on his wife he ordered her to bring him water to wash his hands  the wife expecting no other fate than to be cut to pieces if she demurred immediately arose and brought him the water   ha thank god you have done so said he  otherwise i am so irritated by these senseless brutes that i should have done by you as by them he afterwards commanded her to help him to meat she complied but he told her in a fearful tone of voice to beware as he felt as if he was going mad  thus passed the night she not daring to speak but strictly obeying all his orders after letting her sleep for a short time he said to her get up i have been so annoyed that i cannot sleep take care that nothing disturbs me and in the meanwhile prepare me a good and substantial meal  while it was yet early the following morning the fathers mothers and other relatives came stealthily to the door of the young people and hearing no movement feared the bridegroom was either dead or wounded and seeing the bride approach the door alone were still more alarmed she seeing them went cautiously and tremblingly towards them and exclaimed i traitors what are you doing how dare you approach this gate  speak notbe silent or all of us you as well as i are dead  when they heard this they were much astonished and on learning what had taken place the night previous they esteemed the young man very much who had made so good a commencement in the management of his household and from that day forward his wife became tractable and complaist so that thqe led a very happy ufe a4w ivo jo f9oq go hsw bs aa sidto mmhu my

cha4rles reades no vels i believe that publisherswho have their opinions just as other people and perhaps may be supposed to know something about booksare fully agreed upon one point that women make more successful novelists than men looking at the question from a publishers point of view considering that there are a dozen women who read novels to one man that most women like most men are lacking in imagination and therefore like to have things presented from their own the feminine point of view this fact does not seem remarkable probably scotts novels when they first came out were in less demand than those sweet works of letitia matilda hawkins and one can very well understand how those books which prophesy smooth things accept all the little social makebelieves and consider the convenances as if they were actually the revealed law may be more delightful to many people than those which set forth the grave and terrible realities of the world the solemn responsibilities which years bring upon us all the temptations which beset us the ambitions and the disappointments the inherent nobility of human nature the possibilities always open to the most fallen and the east importance of every single mans conduct to those who are associated with him making every allowance however for the people who read only to be made to laugh for those who have small imagination for those who like smooth stories of society and for those who like to read what may be called tales of the lower nature it has always been to me matter of great astonishment that the appearance of a novelist among us like charles read should not have been receivedi do not say with wider popularitybut with a more ready and more generous appreciation on the part of the critical press the truest and best distinction which a writer can obtain is the appreciation of the general reading public and it may be said of the novelist as of the dramatist that critics who may at the outset greatly help a new man cannot even if they try extinguish him critics for instance for a good many years went on trying to extinguish miss braddon but they failed and her books continue to rise in reputation they said all kinds of hard things about her yet she got a larger dlienlle with every new novel the reason was that the critics only saw certain obvious faults of style and failed to see beneath the style the genuine storyteller the real secret why miss braddon has succeeded is because she has always a good story to tell and has always told it effectively in fact there is good reason for the success of every novel that does succeed it may be in bad tastethe majority of mankind do not know good taste from bad it may be vulgarthe majority of mankind are themselves vulgar it may turn on forms of wickedness about which some people prefer not to speak but others love to read it may treat of the lowest depths like  lassommoir some people like to be in imagination among the very beasts of the people so that if a work of fiction be in demand it behoves the critics to discover what are the qualities which cause this demand now in the case of charles read we have a long series of novels every one of which has been successful and many enormously successful yet he has received from critics nothing more than the usual brief comment accorded to every writer of the least name as each novel was presented to the world i am not so foolish as to suppose that critics ever try to keep a man down here and there a malicious onslaught may be made but as a rule they seem to me a kindhearted and indulgent body there is however a wide difference between recommending one book after the other and forming a deliberate judgement on the position occupied by the author of many remarkable novels there exists perhaps among critics something of the sheeplike quality which makes them follow where one has had the courage to lead no one has yet led so that while we have been inundated with essays on the genius of george eliot miss thackeray and others i do not remember to have read one single serious effort to explain charles reades success to account for the popularity of his novels or to award him his place among english authors perhaps his success is not even known yet i believe that among those who do know it is perfectly well understood that of all living men who write novels he is the most widely known the most read and the most admired remember that there are the people in america in india and in our colonies to consider besides the subscribers to our circulating libraries in the quiet plantations on the coffee tea sugar and indigo estates on the silent sheep runs in faraway farmhouses in the states and canada and the colonies everywhere the men read novels here in this country there are more women readers of novels than men in the colonies men and women together all love novels and read as many as they can buy and if all englishspeaking readers were to vote for the best of living novelists there can be little doubt that they would name charles reade since the quartfrly revines have been silent therefore i should like to be allowed to state some of the reasons which in my mind have united in placing this writer in this position i wish be it understood to speak not as a critic but as an admireri am one of those who would so vote i entirely agree with the popular verdict i for one consider that read takes rank with fielding smollett scott dickens and thackeray that is to say in the great and delightful art of fiction wherein the englishwho are always in every age doing something better than their neigh bourshave surpassed the world charles read stands among the foremost and best first then he is a scholar this means among other things that he brought to the study of living man and woman a knowledge of ancient men and women he knew what to expect the forces which impel mankind and drive us hither and thither are and always have been the same necessity still rules those who speak english as she ruled those who spoke greek the same temptations assail us they are met with the same heroism or the same cowardice the way of the least resistance is always open to man and he generally to his discomfiture takes that way we change the sky but not the mind of man when we read aristophanes lucian martial and horace those have become already critics of humanity who have read these writers a liberal education of course means much more than thisdoes reades strong and vigorous style owe nothing to early compositions in latin and greek but this is surely a great deal before that great anatomist rabelais held scalpel in hand he had studied all that was written by the men of old on the human frame when filled with awe and adoration towards the maker of so wondrous a mechanism he stood before his subject about to penetrate the mysteries of the body he knew what to expect so he who would show the mysteries of action thought motive and desire should first have studied in the ancient schools it is a great injury for instance that we have done to women in withholding from them the liberal education in restoring it to them at their new colleges and high schools we have taken the greatest step towards putting them on the same level with men i believe that by means of likra humanios women will recover the critical faculty learn what is meant by style study epigram and perhaps cease to believe without reason it will be a strange outcome of this revolution in education if in twenty years or so the women novelists will write like read rather than like their predecessors of the present generation secondly charles read is a dramatist observe that the drama permits almost everything except verbosity and tameness a drama may have nearly every fault and yet succeed if it be lively and not verbose but the great majority of novels are verbose to the last degree without action and without incident if such a story as  griffith gaunt for instance be compared with almost any ordinary novel of the day the first note of difference will be found in the overwhelming amount of incident in the former as compared with the latter the second that the descriptions of persons scenery place voice gesture c necessary in every novel are much shorter in  griffith gaunt  than the other the third that the conversations do not drag and seem too long or discursive but that they carry on the action and develop the characters our old dramatists hung up a scroll on which was written  a room in the kings palace the actors by their dialogue and their gestures presently brought the place home to the imagination the spectators saw that splendid roomthey were actually sitting in it they were assisting at the council of the kings most excellent highnessthough the play was but on trestles in the courtyard of an inn slow brains saw nothing then as now if you give them the stage mounting of the haymarket they see no more you cannot by any means of upholstery tear out of himself for a moment the unhappy wretch who has no imagination now charles read in his novel work resembles the old dramatists if he takes his reader to a north country fishing village he does not make up an elaborate picture of the houses the boats the nets spread out upon the seashore the smell of the fish the narrow streets the reek and the dirt of it i do not say that in some hands such a description is not pleasing but it is not part of reades method he is not a painter of scenery nor of houses he does not care for picturesque  bits  and effects of light unless they help his story he is a painter of men and women therefore in the space of half a page or thereabouts he introduces us briefly to the kind of folks we are to meet and then sets them to talk for themselves not a bit of furniture not an inch of tapestry no blue china no cabinets yet when all is told and the curtain drops we know the place where the people live better than if we had read pages of description this is the art of the dramatist fielding who is also a great gossip and perpetually talking to the reader on his own account possesses this art his characters by their acts and their conversations reveal themselves and their surroundings for my own part i have always wondered how charles read could bear his novels to be illustrated except out of kindness to his weaker brthred i saw lately in a review the statement perfectly and literally true but actually made as an objection that read describes his characters from the outside exactly the dramatist describes his characters  from the outside there they are on the stage the king with his crown the soldier with his sword the priest with his shaven crown what more do you want presently they begin to talk and they show themselves as they go on building up their characters bit by bit or it may be revealing themselves in one or two masterstrokes the forciblefeeble writer describes his characters from the inside that is he tells you beforehand what he wants you to think of them this method helps the folk whose imaginative powers are weak it will therefore continue to be practised and to be in demand but which may we ask is the better art to make the characters reveal themselves or to describe them from the  inside looking therefore upon his story always as a dramatist considers his plot reade at the outset seems to have considered strength as the first essential in his work he aims continually at strength  he achieves strength in three ways first by a style which is always reined in nervous and vigorous in the purest english next by clearness of vision in his own mind you cannot draw a portrait when you do not see the face witness the blurred features of daniel deronda whose portrayer wrote round him and about him right through four dreary volumesor was it sixand left him as uncertain to the reader as he was to his biographer thirdly reades strength is achieved by his conscientious fidelity to truth not only is he true to his characters but he is trve to his plots i mean this there are so many complications possible in life that there is no difficulty whatever in finding the materials for a story but the artist must have story and characters to match he must have players who can play the parts and look the characters he must have a plot which springs naturally from the given conditions and does not appear manufactured the age the position the very names of his characters must belong to his story now all reades stories are strong and strong in their studied art which seems so unstudied many of them depend upon situations which in less skilful hands would be merely melodramatic in his they belong to the natural development of the plot thus  it is never too late to mend is one long series of striking incidents it is like a french play in five acts and cinquante tableaux there is material enough in it to make a dozen threevolume novels with the wordspinning and characterdrawingm which fill them out in  love me little love me long the contrast between david dodd and reginald talboys struck almost at the opening is a situation in itself maintained throughout with wonderful skill and success then is there anything more delicious than peg woffington pretending to be a portrait in triplets studio in put yourself in his place he covers the canvas with incidents he is prodigal of incident as becomes one who is fertile in devising situations continually new while in the short  wandering heir he has at least halfadozen situations all new and all strong one need not continue the list enough has been said to show my meaning that strength is the main quality desired by this author endless as are the variations which differentiate men so that the day will never come when the choice is exhausted the novelist who has studied his art has to remember that while many of the varieties lying ready to his hand are uninteresting he has to select for the purposes of his groups only those who will fall naturally into line with the rest and be able to take their part in the development of the story if you consider you will observe that read never introduces a needless character nothing more hinders a play nothing more endangers its success than a character not wanted reade as i have said before writes his novels as if he were writing a play scene after scene act by act the story advances what does not help the story along must be cut out and as in a play a man does not come on the stage with a paper tacked on his back describing his character but proceeds to show himself by words so in these novels every character shows who and what he is by words and deeds many weak writers can imagine vividly and can describe more or less what they imagine their characters to have done and why they did it reade on the other hand i repeat does not describe he makes his puppets act their own story and tell it themselves putting in only here and there the necessary explanation the canida jundmra which must never be beside the subject and must like the conversation advance the story he is not himself a narrator so much as a dramatist his works are almost ready for the stage his characters portray themselves strength truth aninationthese are three excellent qualities for a novelist to possess they will not be denied to charles read even by his enemies there is however a great deal more i have observed that he is a scholar and a student he says himself  wandering heir appendix p 305 i studied the great art of fiction closely for fifteen years before i presumed to write a line of it i was a ripe critic long before i became an artist my critical knowledge has directed my art but the practice of that art has not diminished my studies he has approached art therefore in the truest spirit that of a resolute student who knows that there is much to learn but is conscious of his powers i know no other example in history of a writer who deliberately proposed to become a novelist and spent fifteen years in preparation for his work the preparation was manifold in meditation about the quiet walks of magdalene in cultivated talk in the fellows common room in life among books in life among men in studies of french books and of francereades wide reading in french literature lends a flavour to his work which is as charming as it is easy to be recognised by those who also read french when he finally sent forth his first workit was i think  peg woffington a master in fiction already full grown stood before the world in another part of the appendix to the wandering heir he defines fiction as the art of weaving fact with invention if he goes on to say it were mere arrangement of fact thousands could write it the paragraphwriters and pennyaliners would become great novelists if it were pure invention the young would beat the older men out of the field but they do not because though they have invention they have not accumulated facts and they have no art dickens is the only great novelist who made an early success and there are many circumstances in his youthful history which account for that success let us therefore consider what is meant by the word fact he means that whatever be the story finally decided upon by the novelist it must be based upon a solid substructure of social life which must not be invented but be a faithful and truthful presentment of reality now the hardest thing in the world to get at is reality there are six hundred and fifty men in the house of commons hammering all night long and every night over what they call reality and the only reason why they do not agree is because they cannot convince each other of the real truth what then is the novelist to do he must go to all the available sources of evidence he must collect together all the undisputed facts and draw his own conclusions he must spare no pains in working out the problem for himself so far as the data allow and with no bias thus to illustrate reades method he found in the trades unions and the strikes with all the tyrannical cruelties and contempt of law and justice manifested in bringing the men within the unions an excellent subject for his pen he began therefore by collecting together arranging and digesting a solid body of facts he collected them from various local journals from blue books and reports very likely from visits to sheffield and other places and from conversations with workmen and their leaders when he had got these quite ready and not before he constructed his story now a story may lend itself to facts but facts cannot be got to accommodate themselves to a story there is the result howeveran actual presentment of a trades union a living chapter for future ages of this nineteenth century life all his books again represent life in action thackeray loved to sit at a club window and watch the procession along the pavement of old fogies old bucks old warriors old dowagers young dandies girls in carriages actresses gamblers brave young country lads admiring colonials and the rest who make up the world of clubs and of society reade who cannot be compared with thackeray because there is no single point at which they touch loves the life of action it is the brave workman fighting singlehanded against a union it is the young sailor handsome gallant and simplehearted against the man of the world it is the girl disguised as a man it is the wretched criminal struggling upwards to the level of self respect or the husband tortured by jealousy always real life with flesh and blood temptations and a hatred of hothouse and artifi ciality all his charactersyes allare men and womcn because if he flings a figure even for a moment on the canvas he finishes it with a few bold strokes and it remains a portrait not an uncertain phantom the true artist will not scamp any part of his work everybody is real everything seems to happen as it might happen to all of us even when the scenes are the most romantic and the situations are the most unexpected and this because he weaves his fact with his inventions so that one hardly knows where reality ends and romance begins and the novels taken altogether cover so wide an area that we may certainly accord to read the glory of being the chief painter of english modern life in its many forms from the belle of the season to the fishfag and from the peer to the convict i believe however that the great uninteresting stratum of life known as the  lower middle class  has been left quite untouched by him probably because he knows nothing of it he gathers his material where he can like moliere and shakespeare if he wants to write about modern times there are the daily papers the essays of the monthly press the bluebooks the pamphlets all kinds of things it he wants to write about the past there is the literature of the age to teach him some years ago an attack was made upon him on account of this very use of literature i would rather not speak of the trouble because the assailant is no more among us but one must allude to it in the story of the  wandering heir  the author had occasion to describe the gambling of a ladies party he went to that treasury of social manners and customs4swifts works and found in the wellknown  journal of a modern lady the ordering of a ladys whole day from morning to evening with the style of talk which went on he was accused of plagiarism and defended himself in a pamphlet which must be allowed to be a masterpiece of good english as well as of strong invective the following is the process as described by himself by which he handles his materials the perusal should be instructive for young noveliststhe first strata of facts i had to build my figment on were two reported trials in one james annesley was defendant on a charge of murder in the other craig v anglesey he was virtually plaintiff in a trial at bar for great estates and titles you will find the first case in  howells collection of state trials the second craig v anglesey is badly reported in howell i used the folio report published by smith  bradley dublin 1744 this book shall be deposited with my publishers that any novelist or critic who likes may see the use i have made of it the next source of fact was the amemoirs of an unfortunate nobleman written by james annesleys attorney upon the whole it is a tissue of falsehoods but there are a few invaluable truths in it the lies declare themselves trumpettongued the truths arc confined to james annesleys adventures whilst he was a slave in the colonies and his return home with admiral vernon i used a few of the truths and shunned all the falsehoods the memoirs being rather a rare book shall be deposited with my publishers for inspection in the three books i have now named lies half a plot but only iefntion of equal hwer with tah facts could make it a whole plot therefore i invented philippa and all her business and the whole sexual interest of the story i tell you this union of fact and imagination is a kind  intellectual copulation and has procreated the best fiction in every age by a law of nature to go into smaller details the irish schoolmaster and his  tall talk  are from facts supplied in print by carleton the irish curses i have used are culled with great study from three authors carleton banim and griffinand selected from an incredible number the decayed irish gentleman  the scornful dog who eats dirty puddings is fact taken from  a tour in ireland published 1740 to be found in the british museum the country costumes the price of salmon and other particulars are taken from the  postchaise companion in ireland  and  twisss tour in ireland the great salmon leap from  twisss tour in ireland the turf backgammon board with a boy for dice from oral traditionit was told me forty years ago by an irish gentleman who had it from his father the incomparable speech arrah people people c i had entire from the mouth of an irishman who heard it actually delivered in a fair the abductions and sham abductions of irish girls from ireland sixty years ago and sir j lubbocks  origin of civilisation c c in the other hiberniana of the story i have used the various histories of dublin and cork by gilbert and others the exrept anagwixm the  post chaise companion it ireland letters from a gentleman in ireland to a gentleman in bath rather an uncommon book and a very rare collection of old irish journals i obtained by groping that city for them the charning series of incidents in which john purcell figures are fom his sworn evidence and almost verbatim the abduction of the heir in open daylight is also sworn evidence see craig v anglesey the uncle beating his niece her flight to foreign parts and his apprehension on a charge of murder is a recorded fact i got it out of a chapbook but it has been referred to by jurists in my own day and i also possess it in a ballad called the  new west country garland  james annesleys adventure with christina mccarthy her shah penitence her cajolery and attempt to poison him were told by james annesley to his attorney and printed by him in  the memoirs i and i have set that gem of female nature in my story the discovery of james on board admiral vernons ship by his old schoolfellow matthews rests on the same basis of recorded fact the curious advertisement by jeweller drummond is an actual advertisement of the day taken verbatim from the gteaemans maguzine banker drummonds ancestor inserted it flizabeth shipleys character and her remarkable dream about wilmingtonthis and other vilmingtonia are condensed from ferriss  history of the original settlements on the delaware and from barkers i history of the primitive settlements but whatever in that part of the story bears upon the flagellation and other punishments of men and women and the legal relation of the planters to their white servants has been taken direct with careful study and precision from the various  charters and acts of assembly  of each separate state at or near the ulate of my story and here my method has kept me clear of the errors of james annesleys attorney who says in the memoirs that two of jamess companions were executed in the stakt of drlawart for elopement and suspicion of adultery now the law in that state inflicted no such punishment it imprisoned whipped and lettered it did not kill these colonies were hard upon religious offences but on the whole they did not take life half so recklessly as the mother country did at that time and with regard to sexual criminality they exacted such difficult proefs that their laws on that head were much thunder and little lightning the anglicana generalia have been culled with care from periodicals and books of fact too numerous to specify the masculine costume the women wore in the morning rests on addison amiss 7ournal the london yourna gcnat mans magaixc for 1730 daily courant and other contemporaneous authorities which are full of detail the entire reversal of female costume in the evening rests also on contemporary books periodicals and pictures lord angleseys levee and toilet are put together from alists 7ournal and various passages in the pictorial iistory of england in my novel of  a simpleton  there is a dressmakers bill 1872 in  the wandering heir  there is a dressmakers bill i got the modern dressmakers bill by asking three or four ladies of my acquaintance to oblige me with the original accounts they did so i was about to pursue the same plan in  the wandering heir when i found to my disgust i could not raise the dead so i had to ransack libraries  the graves of those who cannot diecrahk i found the truth i wanted in  the book of costume or annals of fashion by a lady of rank the parsot of colebrook charges the best bred ladies of his day with gross ignorance i fowid that in numerous authoritieslady mary wortley montagues letters mrs stones  chronicles of fashion and alas in my own family letters before and after that date as for their bad spelling that continued long after the date of the parsons observations other ladies spelled phonetically besides miss tabitha bramble hat in england and ireland the men drank hardest but the women gambled most i gained from essays and plays of the time how dublin gentlemen lived i got from  barringtons memoirs  ireland sixty years ago c and how a dublin lady passed her time i got from swifts photographic verses which carry truth as plainly written on them as livy and tacitus carry falsehood if i could have raised three ladies of dublin from the dead i would not have troubled swift but i cant raise the dead any more than mr home can and i have no personal experience of the year 1730 so i took the only remaining source of truth and interwove printed but reliable fact with my figment the possession then of scholarship which gives judgment taste and discernment strength of treatment clearness of vision fidelity of portraiture fidelity of incident the careful study of art the life of action truth in factsthese are qualities which seem by themselves to justify a place in the very first rank but there is still more i think as i have already said that the collected volumes of reades novels present a more complete picture of english modern life than can be found in the works of any other novelist there are separate novels by trollope hardy mrs oliphant sketches by laurence oliphant stories by miss mulock and plenty of others invaluable as pictures of contemporary manners and touching on portions of life outside the field of charles reade but not one has covered so wide an area or studied so carefully or represented so successfully the living moving struggling acting life i do not wish to set up comparisons between read and trollope or any other good writer to each his gifts it is however a very remarkable and suggestive thing about read that he cannot be compared you cannot lay hold of read here and of trollope there and compare their treatment he is absolutely unlike thackeray he bears no resemblance to dickens with blackmore hardy or george meredith the three who seem to me to come next to thackeray dickens and reade he has not one single point in common the impossibility of either comparing or classifying reade or of judging him from a critical point of view which admits any other writer is to my mind one of the strongest proofs of his excellence i propose next by way of illustrating these remarks to consider very briefly two of his works the first of these is one of his earliest christie johnstone it was written early in the fifties there was then as now a good deal of rubbish afloat among the uncritical that is to say the majority a few were trying to get art out of conventional groovesart of all kinds gets perpetually into grooves out of which it is the business of men with brains and clear eyes to drag it then there was a great deal of nonsense talked by certain followers of carlyle about mediaeval men and the decadence of modern times as if the present was not better than the past and there was a considerable quantity of ecclesiastical squabbling the meaning and importance of which is now happily quite forgotten and lost as is the way with this sort of foolishnessonly that more fool ishness of the same kind is always succeeding charles readei am not going to tell a good and wellknown story badlytakes his hero out of the city of babbledom right away to the country of caller herrin and fishwives would you know what the fishgirls are like then read the following and observe that the ordinary novelwriter would not convey so clear a portrait in ten

old court life in france by frances elliot 2 vols chapman  hall there are few subjects better worth treating than the one now taken in hand by mrs elliot thc majority of english readers even those who have travelled abroad and lived in paris are lut imperfectly acquainted with the old court life of france they know something but little of the names of certain kings they know nothing or what is popularly called next to nothing of the people who surrounded those kings and who were often less puppets than movers and impellers of the sovereign such courtlife details present themselves to most readers as the scenes of a new drama on a subject if not entirely novel yet strange and attractive to an audience wearied with authors and actors who year after year go on thrashing the same modicum of chaff in such dramas as this court life there is great splendour com bined with much variety mrs elliots history is not strictly  history she makes her characters speak aa she imagines they would be likely to speak and we must say that mrs elliots imaginative powers are considerable she indulges in such writing as we find in sensation novels and allows us to witness a very liberal quantity of caressing and kissing which we dare say took place as described or ought to have taken place and so is artistically put in but when  stopping her mouth with kisses  is in the foreground of these courtlife incidents hardened as we are our modesty gets somewhat alarmed and wonders with trembling as to what the next stage direction may lead us to infer mrs elliots volumes begin with francis the first and close with louis the fourteenth the former king has always appeared to us as a fortunate ruffian who has had honour far beyond his deserts except valour of a certain sort he had not a single virtue and what would a man be without  the manly heart courage 1 louis the fourteenth was more of a gentleman in his vices than francis the valour of the grand monarque however was not of such a heroic nature as flatterers have proclaimed it to be louis southeast plaint de sa grandeur qui lattache aa rivage was not meant for satire but nothing more sarcastic was ever uttered it might have been said by a courtfool instead of by a courtly poet like boileau there is if the word be permitted a  rascalry  about most of the fine gentlemen who figure in the old court life francis the first could praise the virtue which he could not prize  her soul is as a rose without a thorn he said of his wife claude whom he killed by his brutal indifference mrs elliot truly says of the position of diana de poictiers mistress of the king and next of his son that nothing can more mark the freedom of the times than this liaison and she speaks of diana as being  one of the brightest ornaments of the court the royal mistress was in truth as beautiful a piece of shabbiness as ever lived but morals were in a very confused state francis who after his capture at pavia said or is suppose to have said all is lost except honour stooped to tell a lie in order to get free and according to mrs elliot his sister marguerite prompted the chivalrous monarch to that unchivalrous act when mary stuart appears upon the scene there is a sense of a pleasant change but mrs elliot might have made more of her that hapless queen never looks so bright as when saying smart things against catherine de medicis the marquis de bouilli has noted some of them in his  history of the dukes of guise mary took especial delight in expressing her contempt for catherine as belonging to a family that had been in trade perhaps mrs elliot has been afraid to say of marguerite de navarre all that was to be said and indeed it would make the hair stand on end to read it  she lives in a world of intrigue is a mild form of speech by which to describe one side of the life of this orthodox and erotic lady while to say that  she pendulates between henri de guise and le molle and a thousand other flirtations is a form indicating a certain regularity in a life which was altogether irregular we confess to little or no admiration for most of these people we do not feel any remarkable reverence for that vert galant henri quatre nor do we acquiesce in mrs elliots judgement as to the feminine tenderness of henris mistress gabrielle destrees the mother of henris son the duke of vendome in succeeding chapters the romance of history is not so well told as the history without the romance in the count de st aulaires  histoire de la fronde and when we come to the period of louis the fourteenth we hardly know which are the worse the showy swaggering men or the audacious shameless women lauzun was the typical frenchman of a long period there are a few exceptionally good individuals who occasionally turn up in the moving crowds at the court of louis the fourteenth and ono la valliere who like the young augustine thought pleasure should come before repentance a scene between the lady and louis the fourteenth will give the reader au idea of what we may call the subdued lovestyle of the writer in which she calls in the imagination of her readers to endorse her own   pressed by the king to grant him some mark of her favour la valliere becomes so confused she cannot reply louis grows more and more pressing interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit in the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder again bursts forth and poor louise overcome at once by fear love and remorse swoons away the king naturally receives the precious burden in his arms he seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his attendants in order to obtain assistance ever and anon he stops in the openings of the forest to admire her as she lies calm and lovely in repose her long eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheeks her halfclosed lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth i leave my readers to imagine if louis did not imprint a few kisses on the fainting beauty ho bears so carefully in his arms and if now and then he did not press her beloved form closer to his breast if in this he did take advantage of thc situation chance bad afforded him he must be forgiven  he was young and he was deeply in love words cannot describe the surprise felt by la valliere on recovering to find herself alone born along in the kings arms in the midst of a lonely forest history does not however record that she died of terror or that she even screamed  but perhaps and indeed doubtless she would have done so had not the respectful behaviour of the king reassured her  old court life in france old court life in france by frances elliot chapman and hall historical romance is the handmaid of history even when history has emancipated itself from the level details of the old chroniclers and lives for us in the pages of a macaulay or a froude with something of the passions and changing interests of real humanity there yet remains a place for the historical romance history i3 by profession at least impartial its backward gaze is too comprehensive to allow minute portraiture its aims are too lofty to admit of any but the widest sympathy the nation or the individual as he contributes to the national life is the historians theme in his true function he is a methodioal accountant taking stock of the past who omits nothing balances the errors of one man against the failings of another the greatness of one state against the ambition of another adds nothing to and takes nothing from the facts and figures that lie before him and finally presents the world with his estimate of results in however perfect a manner this operation be performed it is evident that there is yet room for the historical romance rightly composed the romance clothes its heroes with no more living and personal interest than they possessed ra the flesh  but it contrives by a due subordination of details an artful grouping of the principal figures and a light as of the natural heavens thrown on the picture from above to make the whole world appear subservient to that particular spot in space where the little drama enacts itself if the rom ancewriter is a poet so much the better shakespeare though he drew from no other source than dry old hollingshed has filled the story of the plantagenets as far as he told it with life and energy  calling to his aid the fluellens the bardolphs and the falstaffs he made the reigns of our plantagenets something more than landmarks of english history if we had one sterling writer of national romances with genius enough to raise him above the level track of history and yet no coiner of mere fancy with an alloy of fact we should perhaps be greater as a nation in proportion as we saw in the light of today the greatness and littleness of the past mrs elliot does not write historical romance in this way she occupies an intermediate place between the romancer and the historian she presents history in what margaret of newcastle would have called a  romancical dress her method lacks the continuity and completeness of dumas but it allows of greater accuracy and a closer study of character useless details are avoided the material is scanty and at times almost crude  but irrelevant matters are suppressed and those on which must hinge our conceptions of the mans character are thrust sedulously to the front it must be confessed that to interest the reader on such a plan is an arduous attempt it would have been easy to fill in the story with a few legitimate and even historical incidents but mrs elliot has it seems feared to mar the general effect by redundancy  she has avoided the full narrative style of miss freer for instance and elaborated instead a series of animated scenes which in word gesture dress and attitude are intended to be the counterpart of history that mrs elliott has failed sometimes to present in due relief the historical personages who serve as subjects for her nice pen is not to be wondered at that she has succeeded so well as she has is a matter of congratulation one danger we may safely say she has entirely escaped her chapters though often short and fuller of matter than of words are never tediously epigrammatic though it is impossible in this style of work that the artist should be lost in the picture you are not called away too often to admire her artistic qualities the first eight chapters of old court life in france are devoted to francis i his two queens first claude and then elinor of spain one blameless layfigure succeeding another appear the necessary appanages of a court diane de poitier and anne duchesse detampes are the true queens of the hour mistresses not only of the king but in some small degree of the destinies of france the dynasty of mistresses is however scarcely inaugurated in the time of francis the first marguerite de valois and constable bourbon complete the picture in this first essay however mrs elliot is by no means at her best the second group fuller of dramatic incidents offers greater facilities for success catherine de medici the mother of three worthless kings the organiser of the squadron of court beauties the inventor of the sidesaddle forms the central figure from the time fatherinlaw francis  romped with her the entire evening after her arrival to the day when half a century later she lay on her deathbed while the due de guise was murdered overhead this was that due de guise whom the second marguerite de valois would have married but that her mothers ruthless will gave her to the bearnois henry of navarre most of those men whose fortunes and destinies were mingled with catherines during her halfcentury of power and in whom dumas found a neverending source of mystery and intrigue cross mrs elliots stage she has treated them and everything that concerns catherine with much dramatic power and we are inclined to think that this series contains the best written of her sketches as a specimen of vivid description take this of the familiar party of three mother and two sons watching the st bartholomew massacre from a closet over the gate of the louvre to them enter navarre and conde heretics but royal ones who have escaped partly by favour but as it appears mainly by chance charles had recovered his nerves he now looks on huguenots as game and has been potting them with remarkable precision from the window with hideous mirth he boasts to navarre and conde how many heretics he has brought down with his own hand he counts upon his fingers the names of the huguenot chiefs already slaughtered he yells with fiendish laughter when he describes how coligni whom the night before he had called  father looked when dead  by the light of god it is a royal chase  shrieks charles as the page quickly reloads his arquebuse u that last shot was excellent not a heretic shall be left in france again he points his gun and shoots  a piercing cry follows charles nods his head approvingly we will have them allbabies and their mothers  break the eggs and the nest will rot our mother says wellwe must reign we will no longer be contradicted by our subjects we will teach them to revere us as the image of the living god you princesand as he turns to address the king of navarre and conde his tall gaunt figure distorted countenance bleared and bloodshot eyes and matted hair are repulsive to look uponyouprinces i have called hither out of compassion for your youth to give you a chance for your lives as you are alivebut by the holy oriflamme  thought you were both dead already the scenes which unfold the life of henri iv are scantier than we could wish and the episode of gabrielle destrees occupies rather too many of them undoubtedly the most important figure in her  show of kings henri iv deserves a larger space than mrs elliot has allotted to him quitting henri iv mrs elliot comes to the times of richelieu mazarin and anne of austria annes husband the bilious and melancholy louis xih surnamed  the just is summoned to live again his miserable unkingly career in her pages and we then drop suddenly upon louis xiv inaugurating his reign with the ruin of la valliere we cannot however attempt to follow le grand monarque whose court life occupies the latter half of mrs elliots second volume the sketches grow more voluminous towards the close  the last of them is called  the end and from it we make the following quotation  then the dying monarch turned his face towards madame de maintenon who was seated within the ruelle of the bed 41 madame he said in a low voice  i regret no one but you i have not made you happy his voice hitherto firm now faltered but i have one consolation in leaving you he added  we shall soon meet again he tried to look at her but madame de maintenon turned from him with disgust she huddered  what a rendezvous  she muttered half aloud  he cares for no one but himself bolduc the kings apothecary was near and heard her say so that very day she left him while he dozed and drove away to saintcyr on sunday the 1st of september louis died his confessor the jesuit letellier never returned madame de maintenon remained at saintcyr save the cardinal de rohan and the parish priest of versailles all had forsaken him no sooner had  breathed his last than precautions were necessary to guard his body from insult  e are not of the opinion that much is to be learned from the extravagant licence and splendid vices that ruled te court of france mrs elliot has confined her story within courtly bounds and offends no one by the plainness of her speech but after all an intrigue is an intrigue whether the parties to it are kings and duchesses or grooms and servingwomen  and we venture to doubt the ultimate use of such a book as mrs elliot has produced with this reservation we confess to a keen appreciation of the artistic merits ot  ula uourt late in trance hp  oli court life in france this is the fifth edition of a book that has had many readers and many critics it is the kind of book that is especially annoying to scientific students of history who are both jealous and scornful of narratives treated without tootnotes and without much visible aid from documentary evidence unless they are labelled  imaginative literature mere scraps of history in picturesque setting lay figures with historic names affixed and made to play the part which some contemporary gossip has assigned to them are to their mind frivolous and from an educational point of view dangerous the critics are wrong we should never think of going to such books for exact information on every page of this one for instance we feel how the materials have been cooked the scantiest knowledge of history is enough to make us often read characters and motives differently but it does give the popular idea and picture of the personages and events described from a long study of contemporary memoirs from long familiarity with the country the authoress has learned the fitting stage properties has noted the gossip and the anecdotes she has used all her gathered materials not with imaginative power but with the skill and swiftness of the scene painter and scene shifter the result is a nondescript kind of thing neither history nor romance but it is very readable it is a very vivid series of pictures we are given of the princes and lords and ladies of gay old france from francis and marguerite of valois and diane de poitiers down to the last days of the grand monarque when court gaiety died out under the heavy influence of the maintenon and the troubled dawn of a new world the plates from miss pardoes  memoirs of the french court have been reproduced in these volumes which are reissued in a very

the history of matthew wald i i e i f is no feature in which the novels of our age liffer more from those of the last than in the speculative and ideal cast which they have assuned the bustling plots crowded with incidentsthe characters leveloping themselves only in action the brief and meagre descriptions the system which considered subjert as every thing and execution a matter of comparative insignificance have been supplanted by more intellectual and we cannot help thinking more interesting views plots have become simple even to poverty the province of action has been narrowed to extend that of thought feeling has become the mainspring of interest and its analyses and expression the test of talent descriptions of external nature have become more graphical and mi nnte and their connexion with the business of the taleas influencing by their secret but sensible power the feelings of the agentsis better understood and rendered more effective and available the first of these systems certainly indicates a want of refined feeling in the public it was altogether of a meaner and more mechanical castit addressed itself to a lower class of feelings and might have been acted on by minds of no deep feeling and even of scanty invention for though the process of creating an original story is one of no trifling effort the task of combination or disjunction is not a difficult one and a very slight acquaintance with the history of fiction enables us to see how frequently the composition of these novels of incident has been a work of alteration rather than invention they had one advantage however in the very mediocrity of the principle on which they were constructed they were seldom tiresome if the reader perused them with little of that deep thrillin interest which he now feels we have no doubt he yawned less also if he wept lessbe laughed more there were fewer chances of failure for the effect of a sequence of ludicrous or striking incidents admitted of little variation and in the hands of an author of the greatest or the most slender talent produced only a pleasure differing a little in degree but the more ambitious system of modern novelists while it renders the power of genius more visible and vindicates more certainly its lreeminence over mediocrity makes the works of the lesser herd utterly wretched and intolerable destitute of those hum bler attractions of plot and incident which they might have attained andl filled with ludicrous and impotent straining after those more magnificent qualities which it is hopeless for them to emulate or aspire to the present work has nothing to do however with these it belongs to the higher class and if we wished to prove the superiority of that principle of effect on which our modern tales are constructed we know not where we should find a better example wdith a plot of a grosslydefective kindwith few incidentsfew characters of importance and one the most interesting of these appearing only and disappearing as in a dreamwith little aid from humour and less from the mere paint ing of external nature in short by the mere force and grandeur of individual scenes and the general eloquence and beauty of the writing this tale creates and maintains the deepest and most vivid interest and we close it at last with those feelings of dreariness and desolation with which we peruse the remorse of caleb williams or the settled gloom of st leon after his final parting with his son often in the course of the story we feel the unsatisfactory na ture of some of the incidentsthe want of connectionof explanation theunreasonablesupinenessof some of the characters at one time and their fiery and needless impatience at others with a multitude of et cetera but still we are hurried along by the impetuosity of the narrative and it is only when we have fairly finished that we have time to think of all the authors offences against consistency and to wonder how with so many faults obvious to every one we should have so yielded to its influence but the truth is aw this only shews how little sucl things 4 d weigh in the balance of excellence and how easily the atoning power of genius can efface such errors the author is evidently a man of great talent his humour to be sure we do not much like but his pathos his scenes of passion and his eloquence are of the highest kind his conception

tinged with religious melan choly and her character is touched with the same chaste and powerful pencil wald himself we cannot help thinking disagreeable and none of the subordinate agents of the story are particularly interesting but we suppose the reader would rather form his own opinion and though it is difficult to select any pasage that can give a proper idea of the characteristic vigour of the book we shall extract a few of the shortest accompanying them only by such a notice as to render them intelligible the story is related like those of godwin in the first person an arrangement well suited to such tales as depend for their effect on the expose of feeling and particularly to those where the narrator poees no extraordinary qualities euther of evil or good and may therefore

his cousln katharine among the woods and glens of blackford the first interruption to his gaiety is occasioned by the marriage of his aunt with a mr matber who had been tutor in the family and who soon begins to curtail his amusements and to treat him with harshness an in cilent of this kind which young wald revenges with a ferocity above his years leads to his removal to the university of st andrews where he quietly spends two winters in pursuing his studies a sudden resolution strikes him to revisit blackford and it is here that the real interest of the tale begins his feelings when on his arrival he finds a general appearance of restraint and coldness and the attentions of his cousin and his aunt devoted to a fashionable in mate of the housethe honourable mr lascelynethe succession of little incidents trifling in themselves that work upon and irritate his tem per are imagined and executed with great art and probability the fli nishing stroke is given by a discovery which appears to him to confirm his suspicions of katharines attachment to lascelyne and with a promptitude which by the way forms an unnatural contrast to that unresisting irresolute conduct which he dis plays

out and finding the morning fine was tempted to go on i can say i hated the thoughts of taking leavethat at least will be true enough i had opened one of thie windowshut ters and i now thought it would be as well to close it again as i was walking on tiptoe across the room my eye fell on two little black profiles of katharine and myself that we had sat for to an itinerant limner when we were children and which had ever since hung over the chim neypiece i took katharines off the nail and held it for a minute or two in my hand but the folly of the thing flashed upon me in a moment and i re placed it her worktable was by the window and i was so idle as to open the drawer of it a blue sash was the first thing i saw and i stuffied it like a thief into my bosom i then barred the win dow

whether i had lived an hour or a minute when my neighbours rose and i per ceived that the ladies were about to withdraw instinctively i kept my face to the table and fixed my eyes on the opposite wallthe side of the room along which she was wot to pass i was fixedi was a statue and yet i trembled to the bone to think that perhaps the skirt of her gar ment might be rubbing the back of my

laseelynes face he dis mounted and i could not but hear what he said to his groom  tell them said he  that your lady will require the car riage immediately after breakfast in the morning mty horses at the same time for we have a longish sttage tomorrow  yes my lord said the man and i saw the one enter the house and the other take the way towards the stables i prowled about the woods a while and then denned myself in my garret and i need scarcely say that i did not honour the distinguished company with my presence at their breakfasttable next morning but how acute was my ear how distinctly did i hear the carriage steps slap and the wheels begin to roll the death of sir claud breaks up the party wald commences sur geon in the county town in the neigh bourhood and joanne retires to the residence of that old servant who had related her story to matthew wald the following is the picture of their retirement and of one of the visits of wald i deferred this visit therefore till the last evening of my stay when i easily found my way to a lonely and as lovely a retreat certainly as ever sheltered the infirmities of age or the sorrows of youth fast by the green margin of the noble ora and embowered among the fading foliage of his birches stood the little rustic shieling for which that gentle child of misfortune had left the hall of her fa therm the hill rose precipitous behind clothed to the loftiest crag with copses wood from the midst of which here and there the red gigantic trunks of the native pine towered upwards waith their broad sable canopies the wide stream rolling in heavy murmurs close under neath the branches of the trees its dark brown waters gleaming with the gold of the sunset appeared to cut off the wilders ness it embellished from every intrusion of the world asmllu skiff lay chained to the bankand slowly did i urge it with my single strength against the deep and steady flow of the autumnal river from without the appearance of the cottage itself was rude and even desolate but within the habits of another life had already in the course of but a few days begun their triumph i had to stoop ere i could pass the threshold and i trod upon a floor of naked earth but the exquisite cleanliness that had entered with the new inhabitants had of itself robbed poverty of all its meoness every thing upon the walls shone bright in the blaze of the nicelytrimmed wood fire and mammy sat in her elbowchair at the side of it a perfect specimen of the nmajestic repose of extreme but unbend ing age it seemed to me that there was something far more grand about the whole appearance of the old woman now that i saw her under her own paternal roof the bluntness of address and expression which had before been a sort of oddity to amuse a circle of tolerant superiors was now the natural privilege of indepen dence though indeed i am not sure that the sense of home and the instinct of hospitality had not somewhat softened already the external manifestations of a temper which no change of circumstan ces could have essentially altered i was received with courtesyeven with grace and when a minute or two afterwards miss joanne came into the room and modestly saluting me drew her stool towards m1ammys knee i really could not help thinking that in spite of all the young ladys native elegance of aspect and carriage a stranger might easily have been deceived and supposed himself to be contemplating a family group i you will have no great difficulty in believing could not contemplate it with out some feelings of awkwardness as well as of admiration the situation in which i saw joanne bar was new and her demeanour i could not help thinking was almost as greatly changed we had been used to treat each other like friends some spell seemed now to hover over us both our eyes seldom met and neither addressed more than a few syllables to the othershe took her work and i sat listening or pretending to listen to mammy at last i contrived to make it be understood that i had come to take my farewell that i was to leave the country the next morning mammy gave me her blessing very affectionately and i bowed to joanne the poor girl said nothing but in a very low whisper it was  i wish you well sir wherever you go she did not put out her hand and i retired stammering more good byes i jumped into my little boat and had pushed myself a few yards from the brink when i heard my name called in joannes sweet voice and perceived that she had followed me to the bank of the river and was holding something towards me in her hand i ran theskifin again and shc tooped to give me my gloves which i had le behind me our hands touch ed each otherand in the deepening twilight and in the midst of some con fusion of my own i could not be blind to the blush the deep grave timid blush and the troubled workings of that half averted eye how much may pass in a moment my little boat was out in the stream again almost instantly and yet the words return and hope had been whispered and while in rowing acros the river my eyes were fixed upon the lowly cabin i perceived that a shadow was still lingering in the windowand a soft dream floated over my heart that some day i should indeed return and that the world after all might still re tain some visions of hopeay of tender ness and soothing consolation for me even for me no fiery pulse beatno maddening ecstasy or passion fluttered in my brain these were strings which had been snapt but a calm pensive feeling was deep upon me i cannot explain it no man loves twice perhaps in the same sense of the word but although the pinetree will never sprout again after he has been levelled to the ground what need hinder plants of humbler statute yet of softer foliage to spring from the soil beneath which his ponderous roots are mouldering joanne and wald are marriedand great changes follow wald re covers evidence that the connexion between sir claud and the mother of joanne had been such as would according to the law of scotland amount to a regular marriage and that his wife was consequently the heiress of his estatesand the fa mily of sir claud are glad to com promise the matter by ceding to him the property of barrmains his hap piness is qualified however by a strong metlodistical feeling to which the gentle mind of joanne had been for some time yielding and to di vert her

over a good deal of a comic cast which is fairly executed but exceedingly inferior to the deeper parts of the book to which we now approach with rapidity wald receives the unexpected intelligence that katharine had been deserted by her husband and had disappeared and by one of those strange accidents which never occur anywhere but in novels and not in the best of thee either the lodginghouse of

general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls

  the glory of clementina wing by william j locke john lane mr locke must have been very happy when he wrote this story which is likely to be popular if only by reason of its sunny optimism as a piece of art it is artificial enough and if one compares it say with a volume of turgeniev the soul of the one is as full as that of the other is empty here we must make allowance for our conditions when one finds an author of lockes position writing that a man said  blankety blank meaning that he swore an oath these conditions under which english authors write are painfully manifest it imposes upon them artificiality it divorces them from the realities and moving powers of life this said one may praise warmly in quixtus a learned wealthy quixotic humanitarian mr locke has drawn a character after sternes heart and his calvary of evil is delightfully etched in upon the more general theme of love for clementina wing the rugged artist woman who though an admirable study is from any serious artistic standard an artificial creation there is real charm in the book a pleasing note of halfsmiling halfteasing gaiety runs all through it and its morality is absolutely up to the spectators fifthform standard it deserves a success and is quite sure of it altogether a pleasing and charming novel,juvenile_contra
tzction the dmbutante or the london season by mrs gore author of mothers and daughters c in 3 vols london 1846 bentley the season now drawing to its close has produced fewer novels than any within our recollection and these have been with two or three exceptions remarkable for their inferiority no fresh talent has male its appearance to dispel the languor of the premature logdays no promise of future excellence has rejoiced the heart of the reviewer whose business it is not merely to praise what is well accomplished but to note the sians of an  all hail hereafter which by kindly encouragement he may stimulate to the exertions necessary to success and still though no new aspirants for fame have come forth they whose popularity has been already achieved have withdrawn from the field as if they had no stimulus to exertion in the absence of rivalry mrs gone alone of those who hold the highest place among our living novelists has at the latest moment thrown in her contribution to the summer reading of her majestys liegres during that period called holiday when removed from their usual occupations they find it difficult to kill the time that spite of all their endeavours

elysium of their young dreams ihe former it may be will not find their expectations gratified the painting is after the life but not from the life mrs gore has not singled out this or that individual and made him sit for his portrait but she has embodied in a creation of her own the characteristic traits she has seen in society and thus she has contrived to be truthful without being personal the debutaote as its name implies is a story to which every london season might produce its parallel with little more than a change of name a young lady with a large fortune is suddenly plunged into the whirl of spring life in this metropolis she is of course the game at which all the birds of prey who infest those l circles make their quarry but she is wanting in principle and without any genuine feeling and she contrives a sort of flirtation with charles barrington who i can boast no more either of feeling or principle than herself the dibutante ultimately marries a wornout debauchee lord mortayne who had once intrigued with her mother who it seems is a divorcee mr charles barrington marries a passee lady with a l title after a time the pair meet again and renew their i flirtation

are introduced upon which we 1o not touch for reasons already assigned those who are familar with mrs gores writings and who is not will remember that herforte lies in the manner of telling her stories and not in the con struction of them she excels in bold and rapid touches that give us a fulllength in half a dozen lines in lively narrative that never lermits the reader to nod over her pages and in dramatic dialogues that are really lalkings and not speecifyings these traits to which she owes her popularity are manifest in the debutante and comparel with the productions of the other novelists of the season it is beyond measure the best but tried by another standardby her own previous performancesit must be pronounced inferior to most of them we regret to see that mrs gore is falling into the too common but most fatal fault of writing too fast because too much shlc has acquired by long practice a wvonderful facility of composition wve mean of the mechanical parts of it the construction of sentences and the putting of ideas readily into words but she has mistaken this flow of words for a flow of thouglhts hence a certain flimsiness in the matter which it is di iioult to

flimsy pretension to artistic profundity or labour for comic or sensatioal effect no kind of display in short but the quiet accomplishment of the true purpose of the storyteller in sustaining pleased attention to his tale the plot is so natural in its course that exception has been taken to the probability of a main incident that would have been taken for granted as a minor touch of life and

evans that mr lemon has written a novel will from more than one point of view be news of mark to those who care to gossip about literary men and their doings mr mark lemon may almost be regarded as a veteran amongst authors and many people will be eager to test the quality of a first novel by a man of letters who as nfeuilletohute aud dramatic writer has achieved a brilliant reputation some of our best living novelists made their first essays as writers of prose fiction when their years were few and tneir personal experiences limited  vivian grey and  falkland were the productions of mere boys mr dickens and mr kingsley were young men when they ranged themselves amongst the followers of defoe and henry fielding the case was otherwise in the last century  robinson crusoe made its first appearance when the author of the trueborn englishman was in his fiftyninth year  joseph andrews and  the vicar of wakefield  came from writers who had left boyhood far behind them samuel richardson was over fifty years of age when morality was encouraged and virtue rewarded in the pages of  pamela lawrence sterne was a middleaged man when he published the first two volumes of tristram shandy smollett began to write prose fiction at an earlier period of life than most of his contemporaries in art but he had seen and done much ere he penned  the adventures of roderick random and when search in a parish register destroyed the pleasant fiction that evelina was the work of a young lady only seventeen years old it was found that  little burney  had entered her twentysixth year ere she published the tale which won the applause of samuel johnson and burke mr mark lemon therefore by publishing his first novel when he has numbered fifty years and more reminds us of the earlier history of the english novel wait for the end claims attention on another ground the author being also an editor stands in public estimation accredited with many of the piquant jests and some portion of the genial satire with which the contributors to punch have both in recent and more remote years held up to ridicule the tricks and devices of popular novelists thus he is a man who having flung stones now takes up his residence in a house which though it may not be made of glass still has its windows exposed to the return shots of merry fellows bent on fun the hero and the villain of  wait for the end are halfbrothers living at the opening of the tale as undergraduates in the same college the elder brother gerard discovers his younger brother gilbert cheating a foolish freshman at cards and insists that restitution of the dishonestly won money be made to the dupe unless tnis restitution be made gerard declares he will reveal gilberts nefarious conduct to their father sir john norwold a choleric ferocious baronet who will indubitably turn out of doors the son who has dishonoured his name gilbert is unable to repay the winnings but in order that he may do so gerard agrees to join him in raising money on loan instead of having recourse to usurers in london or cambridge after the fashion of undergraduates the brothers borrow money of two rascally tradesmen of the country town adjoining their fathers estate this is the first absurdity of the story besides the personal security of the two young men the lenders insist on having lodged with them a valuable piece of  portable property without the concurrence or knowledge of his elder brother gilbert turns burglar breaks into his fathers house and steals from his mothers room a costly bracelet which is in due course consigned to the knavish miller of morden thus the brothers obtain possession of a small sura of money which without crime or subterfuge of any kind they might easilymuch too easilyhave procured in london the rest of the complicated drama turns on this transaction sir john norwold becomes aware of the theft and attributing it through gilberts vyjany to his elder son drives him from morden hall the oldfashioned fathers  keyurse  of the british melodrania thenceforth becomes the chief power of the story gerard it must be born in mind is represented as a very sensible and courageous as well as thoroughly honourable man but instead of clearing his reputation of the hideous blot put upon it as he might easily have done he emigrates to australia leaving his abominable brother master of the position  to free myself he says to his friend jack spraggatt  i must condemn others to the same fate as that my father has decreed to me this justification is scarcely consistent with the character of the man who resolved to have his brother turned out of morden hall an outcast unless he made restitution of his pilferings at cuds leaving his coat and waistcoat by the side of a river that flows through the paternal estate gerard goes to australia and turns sheepfarmer novelists of a certain sort regard the presence of a coat and waistcoat on a riverbank as conclusive evidence that their former owner has surrendered possession of his life as well as his habiliments if a complete suit of wearing apparel be found near water the fact indicates bathing  but the coat and waistcoat lying on the ground without shirt boots stockings and trousers signify suicide  it being well known that gentlemen when they drown themselves always elect to do so in leggings and braces the disappearance of the heir or morden and the discovery of his castoff clothing being regarded as proof that gerards body has been carried out to sea gilbert obtains the baronetcy on his fathers death and in due course marries and prospers in australia gerard also does well he grows rich marries and has a daughter who at the conclusion of the third volume becomes the wife of gilberts eldest son this is the end for which readers are requested to wait mr lemon should correct in a new edition a few slips of the pen which a fresh eye easily detects thus the author puts the high street of oxford in cambridge he marries lady clara normanton to sir gilbert norwold and afterwards calls her lady norivold it is a mistake to suppose that leases of farms are put up to auction like leases of london houses when jack spraggatt resolves to give up farming in the old country he shows his sister lucy  a silacard headed  the elms whereon was set orth in varied types the startling announcement that mr peter mallett was instructed by the respected tenant of that very productive and eligible farm to sell by auction the remainder of the lease together with all the stock live and dead farm implements c and when jack spraggatt swears an oath to his sister and says  thats  nonsense the author adds in an aside speech  yes he did  it was very wrong but knowing what jack meant the recording angel wrote it down beside uncle tobys oath it has slipped mr lemons memory that uncle tobys oath was not permitted to remain on the record the accusing spirit sterne assures us  which flew up to heavens chancery with the oath

great days by frank harris john lane 6s we have heard a good deal lately about technique and to many arnold bennetts recent confession in the english review that in his mature years he was drifting away from flaubertism and the craft of maupassant came as a rude shock it is true we are always having shocks in this country particularly so in the world of letters a few years ago mr garvice appeared as if from the depths before the areopagus of literary artists blazing forth as the most successful novelist of his time yet hardly one of his mates knew him or had ever even heard of him with style these anomalies are always happening there is in fact no english style as there is in french with its almost mathematical rules of grammar and composition to defy which is to be classed at once as an illiterate in our tongue personality comes through more than the form so that though carlyle ruskin pater meredith kipling broke almost every precept laid down by the grammarians of the kings english these are the men who we have to recognise as masters not the leaderwriters of the times or the schools that periodically rise to try to lead english letters in the direction of some french writer and when such big men arise we bow even if we let fly at them in anonymous press onslaughts these confused thoughts are apt to intrude upon the reader of great days a novel by frank harris as editor essayist critic financier as the author of a splendid work on shakespeare as elizabethan as the best storyteller livingin these capacities we know frank harris now he has become a novelist let me record my honest impression of the book in style it is frankly impressionist curt abrupt told in the manner of the writer of the short story bent chiefly on swift and daring impressions it begins like an autobiography then it appears to be an historical novel an attempt to conjure up england under the reign of  boney next we find a dash of marryat now the whole thing becomes a privateersmans tale a christmas story for adventurous boys great deeds about cutting out french ships running in bales of silk into harbour and all that olly kind of thing etched in with little scenes as vivid as maupassant of sailors life ashore in french cafes which are not for our youngsters at all next we have love not the love of our novelists episodic natural secondary as it were as real love is to men of action and of course our hero is that and then frank harris comes into his own he gives us napoleon a little study very carefully conceived and drawn quite remarkable in its power of presentation and after that we get an equally ariesting study of mr fox fights there are enough for a whole christmas family one splendid seadog business and another between the hero and the bully with the bare knuckles and there are good women too yes frank harris has drawn a  good woman  whom finally the hero marries and all about the book there are characters which stand out and become very memorable to us thus the father of the hero one of the girls of the village the french girl the men around the hero why when it comes to that most of the characters are interesting though all the while we cannot help thinking what a strange motley of a novel it is with its philosophic disputations on jesus more tolstoi its pithy paradoxes its literary manner as were the whole thing a leading article its swift changes of scene and disregard of the unities its power and sometimes grandeur of expression its want of form its charm even its beauty a strange booki a book of the sea which is real a book which lives in the mind something positive this anyhow and thinking of the many novels i have read during the last twelve months i can say honestly that great days seems to me one of the most interesting and powerful in the literary sense of de quincey because it has the true power of creation  great days fiction by frank harris john lane 6s we are not much in love with the hero jack we are not thinking exclusively of the jack morgan of mr frank harris the hero jack is somehow or other generic jack is generally a very vital person in real life in fiction he is nearly always a shadow in great days jack morgan is an algebraical symbol it would be difficult to like him or to loathe him it is as impossible to feel any deep sympathy for him in his vicissitudes as it is to be touched by the fortunes of the symbol x when with its companions in misery it gets multiplied by m or raised to a higher power or compelled with shame to take a lower room the other persons of the drama are almost equally mathematical with the exception of a vivid little group of french people whom jack meets when he is a prisoner of war for jack morgan is taken prisoner by the frenchmen of the great days the revolutionary and napoleonic eras he was privateering when it happened his real line of business is smuggling and his father keeps an inn near dover he has had much to endure from the local gentry so he is pleased with regenerated france he marries the daughter of colonel caressa governor of the prison and a napoleonic enthusiast the marriage is a failure and is really only an episode it helps to swell the rich cloud of misunderstandings that obscure the path to the real heroine later in the story jack gets into touch with charles james fox and very near the end he has an interview with napoleon who tempts him as from an exceeding high mountain he has only to show him how the boulogne flotilla can be got across the book is not one of mr harris best it is moralised

  tile honour of savelli by s levett yeats s low the honour of savelli is a romance inspired by a loving perusal of dumas the writerwho has already made a creditable reputation by his indian storiesacknowledges this and indeed the form and order of his plot and incidents remind us many a time of certain stages in the history of the famous gascon adventurer what dumass imitators cannot catch is his wit but it is ungrateful to make a comparison for mr levett yeats has written an excellent story he has picked out a suitable epoch of history which admits not only of the introduction of such interesting personages as machiavelli the borgias and the chevalier bayard but which faction being rife and plots and counterplots the order of the day in florence and rome presents abundance of perilous errands for the brave savelli to be entrusted with there are commonplace passagesthe particular accusation which unjustly disgraced the hero at the beginning does not content us and there are improbable onesnotably his failure in spite of abundant opportunity to see through the disguise of madame dentrangues nevertheless mr yeats though shaky as yet on his new ground has written a strring and spirited story which we have read with interest to the end,juvenile_contra
foul play new novels by charles read and dion boucicault 3 vols bradbury  evans  foul play is almost too tame a title for this extraordinary labyrinth of schemes and surprises we are inclined to rechristen it on the tenterhooks that would equally describe the position of the characters in the book and the feelings of its readers the very first scene brings us into the midst of the excitement which is not to be allayed till the end of the third volume messrs read and boucicault can spare no time for opening descriptions for laying the groundwork of their plot for introducing us calmly to the persons of their drama these persons are thrust upon us one after another as they are wanted they are sketched in with a free and powerful hand and they uiver with what looks very much like life fader other circumstances they might possibly be real quiet breathing shapes needing but a touch to clothe them with flesh and blood but here they are given up to the exigencies of the plot and they must spend the three volumes of their life in planning desperate things and then doing them they are the ishmaels of fiction their hand against every one and every hand against them at times the wild tangle of plot and counterplot is too much for our endurance the jungle rises far above our heads and we merely hear the buzz of those voices which are whispering their secrets to their confederates forgeries upon forgeries spies upon spies villains who pass for honest men and honest men seeming to be villains double and triple disguises which are detected all at once superhuman ingenuity combined with the absence of the commonest precautions make up an atmosphere of their own in which the story moves and without which the whole would be a mirage of impossibility this is not the art which conceals art or that which looks like nature the book is a marvellous exercise of ingenuity and that is all it is a 3cene where the stage carpenter has triumphed fewer disguises and a little less complication would have produced a more artistic story we should not have been so much struck by the cleverness of messrs read and boucicault but we could have spoken more highly of their work as it is they have given birth to a curiosity but one which has no life in it it may be the talk of the season and so long as it is talked of it will be admired every one will remark that where other novelists have been content to tell how things were done messrs read and boucicault have done the things themselves we do not mean that they have actually scuttled a ship for though their description is vivid we can remember the trial at the old bailey which furnished them with the materials but instead of giving an account of the forged promissory note on which the plot turns they have given us though note itself we may compare every stroke and every letter with the genuine handwriting of john and arthur wardlaw evidently that part of the novel has been written by an expert we do not know which of the two authors has devoted himself for years to the study of handwriting perhaps mr read was working on this in london while mr boucicault was being wrecked on an unknown island in the pacific it may be the other way for all we can tell and the guesses we may make at the separate paternity of any one scene may merely show that we have no data to go upon yet we should particularly like to know which of the two authors wore a collar of rushes and stood up to his neck in water while making ducks his aerial messengers as for giving any idea of the plot that is quite out of our power we doubt if any one could take up all the links in their turn without missing some of them if we except is the original blemish of making robert penfold r succumb without an effort when he is tried for ie forgery there is nothing in the rest of the story ie that is inconsistent with itself but then this d consistency is gained at the cost of what would ie be much better the novelty imparted to the t book lies wholly in the incidents we have made the acquaintance of all the characters before they have the stamp of mr reades old creations too strongly marked upon them it is true that we see them in a new fight that the vivid flashes thrown upon them bring out other phases that their circumstances are different yet the statues in the vatican gallery when seen by torchlight are the same as those seen in the daytime and mr reades characters are always of the same type though their shading gives them another surface the convict in this book is innocent and the convict in  never too late to mend was guilty hut mr read follows the example of the world in treating them too much alike during the period of their sentence helen rolleston too reminds us constantly of mr reades former heroines whenever there is a chance of getting her in positions analogous to theirs the secret of this is that mr read rests exclusively on certain female characteristics and that there is a sameness in his mode of depicting them the caprices the selfdevotion the sudden inspirations the want of any sustained reasoning power which mark his women recur almost regularly in all his books his mannerisms of description appear to numb his observing faculties in this story too he is unduly weighted by a supersubtle plot we say  he without forgetting that another has a share in the work and no doubt a share in the characters but these traits of female character are the work of mr reade whether they are due to his hand or whether the two authors after becoming experts detectives shipwrecked mariners and diffusers of intelligence over a hundred leagues of ocean have ended by changing places bodies and minds with each other the scenes in the island though they are less credible than the rest of the book and though they tantalise us by the minuteness of their detail which retards the solution of the chief mystery are really the part by which the book will be remembered we turn back to those scenes with some genuine interest after we have sated our curiosity with the triple forgeries of arthur wardlaw and the spies employed by helen rolleston to track his spies to their master yet it is impossible to enjoy the description of the island when all the while we are longing to get away from it and we can hardly sympathise with those efforts which when successful will merely open a more arduous labour we have too much before us at once and the whole work is overloaded it is the natural result of this that the end should be tame and that when arthur wardlaw ends as one at least of mr reades characters has ended before we feel that there has been rather a collapse than a ddnouement,juvenile_contra
marmaduke herbert or the fatal error a novel founded on fact by the countess of blessington 3 vols bentley lady blessington has never written so well as in this novel of marmaduke herbert it is altogether her best book in thc construction as well as writing of it the interest is great and sustained by fair and honest means the narrative once begun its design is never lost sight of the attention never called away some will think that it is even too closely and exclusively pursued and the sentiment of it pushed to extremes but this is a question of art which will always arise we apprehend in connexion with thc school of romance to which the book must be said to belong marmaduke herbert is planned aud executed in the manner of godwin that is to say an elaborate investigation of feelings thoughts and motives with minute detection and analysis of the familiar workings of the heart is built upon a groundwork of romantic incident a certain degree of monotony is inseparable from a plan of this kind  but in the ready acuteness of remark the new and happy turns of reflection exhibited by the writer and the value of the lesson steadily enforced we have found thc look extremely interesting the design of it may be briefly described as an exhibition of the evil entanglements which attend concealment of the truth these are shown to be equal in bitterness to the evil consequences which i attend an act of crime in this respect and  in the autobiographical form of the narrative marmaduke herbert reminds us very much of a novel by lady georgiana fullerton which obtained considerable success a few years siuce but the treat ment differs in this respect that the meutal analysis is more closely carried out less distracted bv irrelevant scenes of passion and better accounted for by peculiarities of temperament and education there are minds in which the effort to be wretched with or without reason predominates over every other quality or feeling  and this in its origin development and growth is excellently portrayed hy lady blescinffton false interest is thus repelled and no claim for exaggerated sympathies on the heros behalf is faade it is wonderful

late for his own happine but in time to detail for the benefit of others the source of his needless and selfinflicted miseries  we are the victims of circumstances over which r frequently have no control our happiness or misery depends on some trifling chance against which no prudence no forethought can guard us and the result of which colours our fate for the remainder of our lives that is the notion with which the feeble will justify their weakness always but the higher truth is sought to be impressed by the moral of th tale that mans conduct is his good or evil angel and that no one can move through the world unattended by the shadow of what he has said and done in it  oh  the vanity the folly which leads erring mortals to believe themselves the victims of destinya belief so

by the coun tess of blessington in 3 vols london bentley 1847 this novel displays a great amount of talent it is written in the most vigorous style and a powerful interest is at once c eated which is vell and ably sustained coie recommendation it possesses lies in the fact that it is distinguished from the general run of the novels of the present day by the absence of sentimentality it does not obtrude upon the reader descriptions of dinnerparties and ballrooms introduced in some instancts only to persuade the public that the writer has figured at them such books are very agreeable no doubt to young ladies reclining at their ease upon sofas and ready to be pleased and gratified with any fiction under the face of heaven but they are sickly food for the general reader to the young they seem new but the more experienced novelreader naturally seeks for something more original than a dinner flirtation a ballroom mishap or a toilette reflection the novel before us turns upon a fearful catastrophe the occurrence of which near the commencementof the work poisons as it was intended it should our enjoyment throughout and rouses a painful sensation which mingles strangely with whatever gratification we may receive we feel while the prospect of the greatest happiness is sketched out before us that a gloomy shadow lowers across the level plain that with the perfume of the sweetest flowers is mingled the damp unwholesome atmosphere of death that enter where we will into bower or hall the pale shadow of a murdered girl stands in the threshold pointing to her unwilling murderer and warding off perfect happiness from his path all through life the interest thus created painful as it is is still calculated to arouse intense feelings of curiosity there is a power of fascination in things of this kind our eyes involuntarily turn towards any object which pains us and therefore possesses the power of moving our souls  marmaduke herbert is therefore sure of success public curiosity once excited will be gratified the style of the narrative involuntarily reminds us of the story of caleb williams and this is because though the events are of a different character the incidents upon which the interests of the stories turn resemble each other it is not the actual crime or fault which can be said to be similar but the fact of the concealment of the fault the mere commission of the error in the present instance would not have led to the same results the con cealment of the first step instead of witdrawing the hero from his painful position naturally only flings him stilf more deeply into it one error leads to the commission of another and unhappy himself all through life he renders others equally so the domestic miseries which gradually overtake him from the days of his courtship of the sister of the poor girl of whose dath he had been the innocent cause and constitute a portion of his punishment for his unintentional crime are most ably drawn and do infinite credit to the countess of blessingtons powers of delineation the present novel is we think one of the best of her productions there are no lengthy digressions the story is told well and briefly so that we scarcely ever feel that a superfluous incident is introduced once in the early portion of the novel this occurs but it is a slight fault and we do not therefore insist more strongly upon it there are however one or two remarks which we feel ourselves called upon to make respecting the delineation of some of the characters we can allow a great deal of licence to the author who is engtiged in the task of bringing before us a woman educated in the camp brought up with officers and accustomed to their trodle of life we feel that she runs the chance of becoming mannish even coarse that some of the delicacy of her sex will be rubbed off but lady blessington has in airs scuddamore passed far beyond the mark her character is not well drawn because it is inconsistent she appears at first under very different auspices to what she does afterwards the woman in real life could not have lost sight of her feminine characteristics so wholly as she did or adopted the cool imperturbability only pardonable in a man which she manifests but even supposing this allowable it does not agree with her kind and gentle care of her niece on the first occasion when she is introduced to us nor has lady blessington at all accounted for her change of manner so abrupt and incomprehensible it seems as though the adventure had been intended to be prolonged but bad been accidentally cut short another objection we have to make is that our authoress frequently enters into details upon the subject of the dead body which would look far better in the columns of a newspaper than in the pages of a threevolume novel they are shocking to our taste our feelings are revolted and only at such itites do we turn with abhorrence from the pages there is an excess of brutality in the manner of the man too who brings tidings of the body which is exaggerated in the extreme besides it was unnecessary and as the messenger had no reference to the story it could only have been introduced for the sake of producing a startling effect it is intended to harrow up our feelings the more by witnessing how our heros conscience reproaches and upbraids itself during the scene in which he is compelled to behold the sufferings of his wife and mother while listening to the mans dreadful details but by a little art a better effect might have been prtduced without the introduction of the messengers speeches besides the few faults we have hinted at there is nothing at which we can have any cause for murmuring the story is powerfully told and scattered through the work are many graphic scenes and many beautiful passages as a specimen of both we extract the following  at length 1 reached the opening of the cavern i entered it and laid down the lantern which cast its faint but lurid light on the grotesque rocks around a sickening dread stole over me at the thought of the change which six months must have ef fected in the ccurse i was about to touch and i drew back with instinctive disgust and horror at the task i had to fulfil nevertheless that task must be performed however loathsome however appalling the operation might be and i moved towards the opening of the inner cavern with the intention of drawing out the body when the loud hooting of the owl so startled me that i nearly fell to the earth ashamed of iny pusillanimity i once more approached the spot knelt down and though shuddering while i did so drew forth the corpse by the feet at that moment a huge bat dew against the lantern which i had placed on a projecting rock upset it and extinguished the light for some time i felt unable to move and almost incapable of thinking my hand still clasping the icy feet at length i recovered myself sufficiently to grope in the direction in which the lantern had fallen and after a considerable time spent in searching for it i found it and struck a light with a tinder box which i had fortunately put into my pocket in fear of accident i dared not look on the face of the dead the shawl 1 had wrapped around it still enveloped it and most thankful was i that 1 was spared the horror of beholding its altered state i commenced digging a grave large drops of perspiration dropping from my forehead while vith the pickaxe i endeavoured to loosen the compact earth to enable the spade to penetrate it while i thus laboured huge bats were continually flitting around me and from time to time the screech owls sent forth their lugubrious cries i dug deep into the earth and though ready to drop with fatigue from the hard and unusual labour i desisted not until i had penetrated some five feet beneath the surface i then averting my head while i did so raised the body in my arms its extreme lightness astonished me but the cause was revealed when the shawl accidentally falling aside exposed one of the arms and hands of the deceased owing i suppose to some peculiar quality in the earth or air in which the corpse had rested it had become dried up like those of a mummy though shocked at beholding the withered discolorred limbs it was less dreadful than to see it in an advanced state of decomposition as i expected and emitting that fearful odour which marks the decay of mortality nothing of this  assailed my olfactory nerves and i was grateful to providence for being spared it i placed the matting as a lining in the grave and then descending with my lifeless burden using as much tenderness towards it as if it were still susceptible of feeling i placed it gently in its last earthly restingplace and read the burialservice over it the sound of my own voice as i pronounced the words of that sacred and touching service powerfully affected me no human accent gave the response but the birds of night shrieked dismally while i prayed i then covered the corpse with a piece of matting and commenced filling up the grave with the earth i had previously dug shrinking during the operation at the thought that the cloak and matting alone intervened between the corpse and the clay i was shovelling over it i would have given heaps of gold had i possessed them to have had a coffin in which to place the cold remains but this was not possible and although i shuddered at every spadefull of earth i threw into the grave i nevertheless continued my painful labour until the floor of the cavern resumed its former appearance i then strewed dust over the spot and arming myself with the pickaxes spade and lantern bade a sorrowful farewell to it never shall i forget that night l an unusual stillness prevailedunbroken save by the occasional bark of some cottagers dog or the cry of some bird of night scarcely a breeze moved the leaves of the high trees whose long shadows fell like giants across the road in some parts so close as to exclude the light i hurried on through this solitude my own footsteps sounding so loud us to startle me and the beating of my own heart making itself audible sometimes a low sighing or murmuring of the heavy branches of the trees moved by an occasional gust of wind dashing down through some deep ravine from the mountains striking my ear with so sad a sound that my superstitious forebodings connected it with a supernatural warning of the danger of my mother and i would hurry more rapidly than before until breathless and exhausted i was coum pelled to rest for a few minutes those fitful gusts of the night wind followed again by a long stillness had something so inexpressibly solemn and imposing in them that they made me shudder and when some mountain torrent rutnhed down the precipitous path it had formed for itself leaping wildly from crag to crag and dashing its white foam around i felt as if it were some mysterious agent endowed with power from which i wished to escape and again i hurried on until out of hearing of its deafening noise then blaming my unmanly weakness i would turn back for a moment by the dark and funeral mountain pines and the next instant breaking into light its white masses like huge heaps of snow falling from some alpine height into the valley beneath with the sound of a mighty flood and angry with in self for even the momentary delay i would resume my rapid pace while the fresh mountain air failed to cool my fevered brow or burning lip at length the spire of the village church near my home became visible its little vane shining brightlyin the moonlight often in the days of my childhood had it guided my path home from the rambles i delighted in  and now weary and fainting i hailed it with an emotion that brought tears into my eyes i trembled violently as i approached the house i longed yet i dreaded to pass its threshold toe know my fate all my future happiness seemed to hang on the answer that awaited the question my tremulous lips refused to utter  have i still a mother a deathlike silence reigned around the garden gate was unlatched and i stealthily entered it and passing through parterres of flowers that looked snowy white beneath the beams and whose fragrance filled the air i approached the door lifted the latch hurried through the hall and into my mothers chamber

memoir of jane cameron female convict by a prison matron author of female life in prison in two volumes hurst and blackett jane cameron is a fictitious name and the prison matron has been careful to omit dates and modify details so as to disguise the identity of the heroine and her associates but this narrative as we are assured and os we can well believe is truthful in every important particular  a faith full chronicle of a womans fall and rescue it is a dismal painful book yet one that ought to be widely read and seriously thought over it has been undertaken with a view of showing  how the poor and ignorant are  led into crime and are in innumerable instances taught to  regard it as simply a business the evil nature of which  is to them not apparent and in that way to suggest  a  clue to the mystery of temptation and demonstrate to  philanthropists where the first effort should be made to  turn the weak and erring from the danger and this is done as well as a book can do it by the honest and eloi quent writing of the authoress of  female life in prison  the poor creature whose history is here told under the name of jane cameron was born in croileys land in the i new vennel glasgow a nest of tall buildings brimful of every description of vice so full that in one room alone some years ago it was estimated twelve robberies were on an average committed every week while in the moro respectable of the number it is common for fonr or five and often ten or twelve men women and children to eat drink sleep and live her mother rented one of these rooms with some fitness called houses since there were so roany inhabitants in each and supported herself by letting out heaps of shavings to any of both sexes who were able to pay twopence or threepence a night for them  and from the time when she was five years old jane used to bc sent out to beg of passersby in though neighbouring and less disreputable streets  iou should beg of the welldressed was the

so jane cameron found it when she was twelve she had a boy of fourteen an expert pickpocket for a  cash and in her fifteenth year she was a mother long before this her own mother had ran away and she had been left to earn her own living in the way that she had never been taught to regard as dishonest or immoral and she had twice been in prison learning there nothing but evil  prisons naethm they take care of ye and gie ye eno  to eatmore than ye get at hame theres naethin to  frighten ye a bitas they told her and as she found to be the case and the occasional teachings of chaplains and matrons was altogether neutralised by the constant influence of experienced thieves there was good enough latent in jane camerons disposition to be brought out and made the groundwork of an honest life had proper care been taken to put her in the right but no care was taken and she was left in the hour of her greatest need to the tender mercies of thieves and outcasts hiey came np to her room where she lay on the shavings in a comer with ber baby and talked to her and bede her bo cheerful for hed get strong enough presently they pitied her position and ignored the bame of it and did their

very need of winning food for thc poor little thing drove the parent into more desperate ways of vice and when after a few months of miserable life the child was taken from her the wretched mother was a hardened criminal the little spark of better nature  died out with the child she had loved a sickening tale is that of ber subsequent career hardly relieved by such an interlude as the one in which we hear of thc holiday trip to london in which she and her new cush black barney an englishman indulged after a successful robbery of more than a hundred pounds when they rode about the city and its suburbs in cab feasted at hotels and visited all the playhouses and other places of amusement as gaily and honestly if the eojoyment of stolen money can have the least savour of honesty as any steady couple could have done the money spent she went back to glasgow and there fell deeper and deeper into the pollution of crime her most successful scheme being to allara foolish men to one of her many

care is taken but if there is joy in heaven over ono sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance there is encouragement enough for the brave reformers upon earth who set themselves to raise up the fallen and if this true womanly book can quicken public zeal on behalf of the criminals who can by proper measures be led back from wrongdoing and better

blackett in no 1807 of this journal fit tribute was paid to the merit and courage of a calm experienced woman neither so calm nor so experienced as in her dealings with that difficult question  the criminal and what is to become of him to lose sight of justice to the poor who are not criminal and who naturally may inquire wherefore the dishonest the unchaste the corrupt should be cockered and petted and have sympathy strained for them and bulwarks built round them while the honest the chaste and the wholesome folk who are the salt of the earth may die of want unless they blow their dismal trumpets in the street to attract people to the show of their misery suchto recall impressions or rather judgmentswere ours in regard to the prison matrons first book is her second one less genuine more made up  will not a third come in due course of time and a fourth  and so on till the records of low highway and byway crime in number outnumber the muses  some question of the kind must make its way when following this awful record of the career of an abandoned female creature rescued at last by a guardian angel the book is obviously a joint production its writer keeping herself in the background owns to having availed herself of male cooperation to verify localitiesto secure the details of the  seamy side of predatory life in glasgow nevertheless we cannot help asking whether she may not be in the foreground as the miss watton to whose experiences this tale must be owing it may not be unfit to restate an old argument of ours to ask to what extent the anatomy of profligacy by popular exposure in lighter forms than those of official inquiry justice and redress thrives so as to prevent the perpetuation of profligacy high or low an abuse is a great theme for a book which is to sell but in laying out its features do those who lay them out sufficiently remember that they are also laying out a path along which any one may walk no matter how high no matter how low a plain coarse path which any walker may follow to ftis oxen ends the dishingup of crime in fiction has been always amenable to thc comment of those who have sat at the banquet but in the case before us it becomes a little difficult to separate poetry to use goethes phrase from truth our  prison matron announces herself as having presented a story certain details of which she also announces have been mystified by her thus her book as it stands is neither fact nor fiction but what a booklet it be taken ever so lightly ever so critically ever so judicially what a tale of crime and sorrow and expiationthe life told from without of a female thief of a child cradled in infamy thrust out into the abyss of want later an unwedded mother when yet a girltaking to daring desperate hardened crime the  prison matron says that  jane cameron was rescued at last it may be so but the tale of the rescue so much resembles a novel that we cannot but read it with a certain suspicion there can be no doubt however as to the painful interest of the tale which moreover is very well written,juvenile_contra

the kingdom of hate by tom gallon 6s hutchinson this story is an interesting experiment on the part of mr gallon we dont ask him to repeat it but at the beginning of his career it is wvell he should try his strength in various directions the author of tatterley has done infinitely better and solider work but his is a very romantic soul and in this zovel of adventure the romance and the emotion at least are real if the incidents be artificially constructed so far as the feeling of the story is concerned he carries us alwvays along with him save where he takes for granted that the lady who was seeretly and by force married to an unknown man whom she had seen for a moment should acknowledge any duty to him she might refrain from taking another husband for legal reasons but mr gallons hero expects genuine loyalty from herwhich is more absurd and unjust than it is romantic the story if we are in a makebelieve mood is a stirring one a princess a wicked count who wants to dethrone her a band of revolutionists equally hostile to both and a hero claimed and repudiated by each party in turn keep things lively not a page but has its exciting incident yet mr gallons invention in this kind of fiction is of the most elementary order therenever was such a book for coincidences of the handiest kind there is always a trapdoor or a tunnel when they are wanted persons whom the width of the world and the most various fortune seem effectually to sever are constantly meeting in the nick of time with the slightest exaggeration it might do for a caricature of the adventure story but doubtless it has been pleasant recreation for mr gallon in the intervals of more serious work and it will pass away an idle or sentimental or uncritical hour quite agreeably  the kingdom of hate by tom gallon hutchinson 6s it appears that mr tom gallon has forsaken the romance of sentiment in order to follow in the wake of mr anthony hopethat particular mr anthony hope who wrote the prisoner of zenda we have here the three ingredients necessary to the kind of novel which mr hope invented a an adventurous englishman b an obscure foreign throne c an unscrupulous pretender to that throne  when i make up my mind to a thing i like to see it carried through and in the way of the successful carrying out of my ambitions stood a woman you may perhaps guess who that woman was    the princess viviana    precisely she is or was in the direct line of succession to this kingdom i am her guardian her father died leaving her practically in my charge he had great faith in mesimple old man you understand the situation  iia man of full powers and great ambitions  a man who cannot brook interference in the smallest details of his lifei was to play seoond fiddle to this slip of a girlto dance as it pleased her to pipe was it likely  was it the sort of thing i should do p f there in the words of the wicked count chailiavia is the basis of the matter let us admit at once that mr gallon has contrived a very agreeable system of excitations thus proving that he can do more than one thing well the dook has indeed several good qualities but these good aualities serve the sinister purpose of accentuating its defect and the defect lies in its construction the author of a story of stirring intrigue is entitled by established custom to the use of a certain amount of coincidence he should however be careful not to exceed his allowance unfortunately mr gallon has in this respect sinned and he has suffered the penalty of his sin the first part of the tale carries no conviction in a hundred pages are three amazing coincidences any one of which should have sufficed for the entire novel if the reader is invited to believe that a young gentleman who for a drunken wager knocks haphazard at the door of a london mansion is at once taken in and married to a lady awaiting a husband at a private altar cf stevenson the reader will probably exert his credulity it is a duty whioh he owes to the author but when the young man having been torn from his bride seeks distraction in paris and there meets by pure accident the prime mover in the original mystery of the marriage then the reader will revolt and cry out upon the author for trespassing on his goodnature mr gallon seems to have forgotten that readers are after all but human with sharp limitations it is a pity for the kingdom of hate is all enveloped in the proper atmosphere of romance,juvenile_contra

was aware of this and at first she hoped unobserved by them yet she soon became conscious she was followed and she fancied known she was somewhat reassured as to this last point by hearing one say to the other  a beautiful figure by jove in an audible whisper just as they passed her they then slackened their pace and seemed determined that she should pass them again she drew her veil closer and thicker over her face and attempted to walk steadily by she at first hoped and believed that they were no longer following but soon again she heard themn close behind and talking in french to each other evidently about her though not so pointedly as to have been remarked by one ig norant of that language which they lo doubt supposed her to be she could not bear the idea of being known which she had no doubt would be the case if she was traced to the bazaar she therefore turned from it sharp round a corner in the direction of her own orome hurried her pace by degrees even to a run and never

listened anxiously for the dreaded sounds of pursuit and thoulgh a few minutes reassured her upon this point in vain she attempted throughout the dayto regain hier accustomed composure subsequently to the occurrence just related oakley visits his friend germain i since his reconciliation with helen he had begun to think that lie had never been sufficiently indulgent to the natural defects in the character of his early friend who on his part had always been very patient under the much more annoying faults to which oakley himself wvas subject he had met germain accidentally the day before and the first advances he had then made to a reconciliation had been at once received with that cordiality which gerni tins goodnatured and placable disposition would have led one to expect oakley had felt much happier since this interview bad taken place and his present visit was intended not only as a further peaceoffering but as an advance towaids renewed intimacy this apiable temper of mind was a little ruffled by tinding fitzalbert there it is imnpossible to conceive any two men who had a more thorough dislike of each other fitzd bert to be sure on his side was a pococurante in every thing

general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public

original painter he has his reward too for he has caught much more than the mere trick of style by no means difficult to imitate and has succeeded more nearly than any other writer we have met in entering into hawthornes psychology with its half morbid and entirely weird conception of life we incline to think  the madonna of the future  the most artistic of his tales though that which gives the title to his book is most fully worked out and is very subtle in treatment recalling here andi there the  septimius  of his model there is one blot in the book the material ghastli ness of the endingof one story the romance of certain old clothes which is more like poe than hawthorne and which we think the author will feel on reflection would have gained in impressiveness by the omission of the last detail and the substitution of a mere look of frozen terror on the dead face the incident as it stands mars the whole conception of perdita with which it is entirely out of keeping eglantine makes no advance but rather retrogression in its authors literary work for it is by no means so good a novel as any of its three precursors there are tokens throughout of too much facility in mere production of copy and too little pains in reducing that copy to symmetrical form to say nothing whatever of artistic conscientiousness in detail which is not atoned for by the occasional introduction of clever sentences and paragraphs the story if it may be so called is an autobiographical mono logue with but little interest since the only attempts at special delineation of character depict types which are tediously common in the modern novel such as the gracious and insincere matron of society and the mature young lady who affects gushing childishness and in these days of realistic painting it is not too much to ask even a lady author to be correct in details meant to give local colour and finish the daughter of a great scientific philosopher of wide general learning as the narrator of the story is supposed to be would not again and again cite the differential calculus  as the tremendously abstruse subject which her fathers distinguished visitors habitually discussed with him they would be just as likely to discuss the rule of three nor would she include gibbons english history as forming along with the decline and fall part of the favourite reading of her model coastguardsman at least it was inconsiderate if such were the case not to make the learned mr leslie seize on the book hitherto unknown to bibliography and give it to the reading public which would only too gladly welcome such a discovery it may be carpingly minute criticism to say that the st bees hood which the model broad church parson of the book wears and of which the author who attempts dutch painting makes a good deal is not purple but a wonderful combination of red and white but that a writer wlio has evidently a turn for marketing and cookery with a hearty relish for her victuals should give as a proof of the utter imbecility of her gushing lady that young persons belief that eggs arc or ought to be sold by the pound strikes us as showing very little grasp of the economical bearings of the subject would it surprise her to hear that more than one american legislature has recently enacted that all eggs are henceforth to be sold by the pound and that the average dozen must turn a given weight on the ground that the present system of selling by mere number irrespective of size is unfair to the purchaser and a permanent discouragement to careful breeding since no advantage is now gained in the market by the farmer who brings the finest and heaviest eggs for sale over his competitor who looks to quantity alone several other questions social and religious are settled in the book just as decisively and with exactly the same amount of intelligent understanding as this one and we would cheerfully give all the judgments and the longwinded reasons for their formation in exchange for a little more life and movement in the somewhat wooden puppets of the tale  jocelyns mista7ke derives its interest almost wholly from its central figure which is a very good study of character mrs spender has not sought to devise novel situations for her plot and has contented herself with using materials which have served many authors before but she has employed them better than usual the main situation in the book for example is not very different from that in a once popular story e laiu wyndham yet there is no likeness at all in treatment so that the sense of triteness does not strike the reader mrs spenders english is unusually good and she has learned the art of working her opinions on men and things into the web of her story in stead of merely intercalating homilies after the fashion of too many of her sisters with the certainty of having them skipped by the judicious reader who desires in the emphatic language of a schoolboy uttered in the present critics hearing more story and less jaw the jocelyn of the book is very skilfully drawn an impetuous wilful passionate imaginative woman in whom the perceptive faculties are far more matured than the reflective who feels but does not reason and who is from temperament what frenchmen call tate montee and americans high falutinc in season and out of season the chief success of the book is the manner in which the author conciliates the sympathies of her readers in favour of the very defective heroine and makes them understand how she could win and retain the affections of two men of exceptional mark and power though of different types and that without her having brain enough with all her imagination and fluency to appreciate the best qualities of either one particularly happy touch quite true to nature is that where jocelyn spoils her application for the post of governess by springing on her hobby at a chance word of her proposed employer and delivering a lecture then and there on the development of woman mfore we think might have been made of the contrast between the fiery and courageous heroine and her vacillating brother but where it is brought out at all it is well done finally the toile of the book is entirely high and sound and though it does not belong to the small first rank of novels that will live it rises in type and diction far above the ephemeral stories of the season olt of society is a commonplace and rather dull book written in a style which is alternately fine and slipshod gorgeous in adjectives and hazy in grammar it belongs to the school of transpontine melodrama according to which hardness selfishness and vice are habitual characteristics of those who move or try to move in refined and wealthy circles while generosity and virtue must be souglht among those who are out of society that a life of much ease and little responsibility is unfiavourable to loftiness of aim and energy of action is doubtless true enough but mrs pulleyne must know very little indeed of modern engrland if she imagines that the line can be drawn as she draws it the artisans who refuse to associate with labourers or even to use the same houses of call the shopboys who rob tills to pay gambling debts the working men who correct their wives with iron clogs are on the whole not more admirable citizens than mrs pulleynes aristocrats and are real flesh and blood while her characters despite of the dedication of her book to a lady of princely rank are clearly evolved from a not very vivid imagination and do not by any means convey the impression of being studies from life and personal contact especially as she has not mastered the somewhat intricate system of english titles of rank robert forrcster is the work of a very inexperienced hand and the best counsel for the author is to attempt a play and to put the manuscript into the hands of some practised manager or actor in order to see how much and what would be cut out curiously enough there is a chapter in the book wherein the heroine by her frank criticisms induces a lady friend to give up novelwriting as not possessing the necessary faculty and being unable to see what is expedient in a book meant to win public approval the actual story in robert forester scarcely occupies onefifth of the volume and the remainder is entirely taken up with digressions sometimes on scenery and more often on what the characters could should might ought or would have thought or done while their actual doings are compressible into a very small bulk indeed thus in one chapter of the book two persons engaged to two other persons meet for an avowal of their preference for one another and nearly twelve pages are given to a chapter which immediately follows this whose whole contents consist of the fact that their conversation was overheard by one of the other pair and that she did not like it ten words in the chapter whiich describes the meeting would have been enough and this is just the place where an experienced manager would have ruthlessly cut down the copy were it a play nor are the descriptions of scenery vivid enough to be worth the space they occupy we have three living novelists who can write of scenery so as to delight their readers air black perhaps first mir blackmore a good second and amr george macdonald third though if his admirable poetical vignettes of landscape be taken into

gargantua and pantagruel by franvois rabelais a new edition x2 2s john hamilton rabelais is too often treated in this country as a classic who may be taken for granted a great humorist whose humour may be accepted on the strength of tradition  gargantuan appetite  rabelaisian laughterthe phrases are used by persons who adopt the epithets on trust who have never read a line of  gargantua and pantagruel yet urquhart translated rabelais and others have followed urquharts example he has never since the middle of the seventeenth century been out of the reach of english readers but perhaps rabelais like boccaccio needs to be studied in an edition de luxe the sort of edition you can prop up against the side of your armchair and browse over at leisure if so here is a new edition hailing from france which is just the thing wanted a scholarly and yet brightly written life of rabelais for which henri bazot is responsible serves as preface it is illustrated by more than five hundred vignettes supplied by joseph hemard an artist who catches the rollicking ribald spirit of his author print and paper are good as of course they ought to be in a volume costing two guineas the only strange thing about the book which as published by john hamilton may be said to have everything handsome about it is that the name of the english translator is not given,juvenile_contra

  new novels why did he do it  by bernard capes methuen  co when mr capes condescends to melodramatic mystery he is apt to take it too lightly he is well equipped for it but to succeed perfectly a writer of melodrama must believe in it or at least not show that he does not believe in it in  the great skene mystery mr capes spoilt his effects by laughing at himself if he must laugh in these affairs let him laugh in his sleeve probably that is what he did when he wrote  why did he do it  it is a fantastic piece of work written with all the skill and style of the author and starting from a very original motive which teases and tantalizes there is perhaps a little disappointment in the fact that the hero is largely divorced from the unravelling of the mystery which falls into the hands of a friend a second defect is that one guesses the nature of the secret half way through and perhaps a third may be added for some tastes at any rate because the mystery has reference to the occult mr capes can draw character with any novelist living but it is not part of his business to delineate human beings here he is content with the conventional and the grotesque it is a pleasure to read a sensational story written by a literary hand even if he does not take his task altogether seriously,juvenile_contra

in a glass das is a glass darkly by j shoidan le faau in throe volume bentley the two tales that fill the second and third of these volumes have lately appeared in magasins and though we do not remember them we suspect that the three shorter tales contained in the first volume have also been already published they have evidently been strung together without much care and neither the absurd title given to the collection nor the prefatory chapters to each serve to link them into an orderly seres they purport to have been translated from the memoranda of dr martin hesselius a german physician and to be specimens of some of the numerous  cases of a kind to amuse or horrify a lay reader  that came under his own professional experience or were reported to him by his friends four of the stories may be included in this description but the longest and best of them is only a welltold narrative of the way in which a young englishman visiting paris shortly after the battle of waterloo was duped drugged and nearly buried alive by a gang of rogues of this story the boom in the dragon volant little need be said save that it is quite as good as any of the longer tales that mr le faun has written and better than most it is a capital instance of that best sort of ghost story which in the end proves to be no ghost story at all a mr robert beckett going to paris with the intention of speculating to the extent of 800001 at the gamingtable meets on the way an old french count and his young wife whom he twice rescues from danger and another frenchman who represents himself as a marquis in disguise and who brings him what purports to be a letter of introduction from a friend in england the pseudomarquis offers to guide him through the riy enjoyments of paris and the soft young man thus falls into l the trap he is put in the way of clandestine interviews with the countess who of course offers to run away with him in order that she may get hold of his 300001 and hand it to her husband we will not tell how the ropm in the dragon volant which is supposed to be haunted is put to excellent use in furthering the plot for this is the main secret of the story one need less absurdity however is introduced mr beckett is drugged by some infusion which paralyses him for several hours yet leaves his eyes open and able to observe every thing that goes on around him whether such a drug exists we leave mr le fanu to settle with the chemists but if there were such an one no clever thief would use anything so likely to facilitate the detection of his crime if however this one needless absurdity is in the room in the dragon volant it is as nothing in comparison with the preposterous incidents that mr le fanu has imported into his other tales the first of these tells of a clergyman who was haunted by the corporeal spirit of green tea a sort of monkey speaking good english in an audible voice and finally goaded by his tormentor to commit suicide the hero of the second is a naval captain who is strangled to death by the tangible and audible ghost of a man whom he had injured long before in the third a judge having wrongfully caused a person to be hanged is lifted out of bed by the spirit of the victim and himself hanged in his own house in the fourth a young lady is courted by a vampire and only saved from death by the timely discovery of the vampires earlier misdemeanours and these repulsive stories have not even the slightly redeeming merit of literary or artistic skill in the telling as a setoff against their ugliness of design they are simply ugly and repulsive yet they are clever enough to do mischief unfortunately the world is not sufficiently educated in disbelief in everything that purports to be supernatural for the reading of such stories as these to be harmless so many people believe even on scriptural authority in ghosts and witches satanic influences and physical resurrections that their belief may be sometimes confirmed by modern adaptations of mediaeval horrors in his vampire story mr le fanu makes his heroine rejoice that she was one of those happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost stories of fairy tales and of all such lore as makes us cover up our heads when the door creaks suddenly or the flicker of an expiring candle makes the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall that surely is a curious taste that objects to a fairy tale yet dresses up in the most seductive fashion a story of a girl whose bosom friend sucks her blood in the night and then goes to digest it in the grave to which she had been consigned more than a century before,juvenile_contra

antrim falls slowly and unnoticeably in love with amrs rawley and on one occasion circumstances being auspicious kisses her after that bit of innocent lovemaking the husband lisappears and she actually imagines antrim has shot him antrim of all people with equal absurdity antrim imagines mrs rawley has tried to commit suicide because the egregious husband in a fit of spleen has wandered off into the bush wvhen after various adventures the remaining two get back to mombasa they would have been received with that consoling comfortable kindness people extend to their compatriots in a strange savage land and they would have gone home on different boats the ghost story is equally unconvincing wthy should a zulu haunt the unfortunate pair because he and rawley have died together  the reader is heartily glad that rawley is dead and sorry dingaans more valuable life should have been thrown away in a search for him but the fate of neither is of any importance when the bones of the two men are discovered the haunt ceases from haunting  you cannot help wondering what mr brett young supposes ghosts and bones have to do with each other and how rawleys fate could matter to a pleasant quiet couple like captain and mrs antrim it is strange that this writer should have been able to content himself with so unconvincing a story his background his atmosphere is perfect soin a

words is often poor the prologueas far as the writing goesis put together better than any other part as i read it i thought that ernest goodwin was at last creating his sentences with the care of a firstrate writer but the first page of the tale proper disillusioned me the phraseology became stilted anl rhetorical at times as the vivid scenes were thrown on to the canvas the writing improved but as a whole it showed signs of insufficient care mr goodwin had not stopped to consider whether the language he was using was the finest possible whether the scenes could not have been cut deeper i would like him to compare the prologue with chapter i for he writes with so much vitality in an age when real vitality is rare that we shall  woodsmoke bv f brett young 7s 6d collins stiletto by

vast and roomy and highwheeled and cushioned and painted in short its a splendid thing to look at but take it out on a heavy road and down it breaks with a vengeance  its full of screws and such tomfoolery and only fit for a smooth road now a peasants cart goes through anything and mine is a perfect jewel the wheels are of my own make and peti has hooped them  peti was not quite so confident

best of it is that it is not too large dont you think so petibut peti made no reply not even when susi catching at the faint ray of hope which fell into the gloom of her life inquired whether the gulyash a promise was not too good to be realised  the gypsy sat motionless with his eyes staring into the darkness which surrounded them they hurried on in silence whilst the fog grew dense and the sky blacker than before no trace was left of either willows mounds stacks or wellbeams still they pressed forward until the splashing in water of the horses hoofs stopped their progress petis fears were but too well founded the place where they halted was under water the gypsy descended to reconnoitre the extent as he advanced he beheld the plain like a wide lake of which he could not see the end he retraced his steps and walked to the right but he found that the water stretched in every direction at length he made his way to a dry place to which he directed the gulyash  let us go on in this direction said he as he took his place in the cart there is some chance of reaching the forest be careful ishtvan and keep close to the water or else youll lose your way this heres the yellow spring  christ save us cried susi  we are surely too late and my poor husband   no said the gipsy with illdissembled concern  unless the water has flooded the frogs dyke we shall find the black lake dry and if so were safe on with you ishtvanconfound the theiss said the gulyash as he whipped his horses on nonsense its not the theiss twas but yesterday i saw the river at ret its as quiet as a lamb but this water comes from the new ditch which the gentry have made they make the water mad with their ditches and dykes a thousand thunders  theres water here  and he pulled the horses back one of which had slipped and fallen susi wrung her hands peti jumped down and walked through the water he came back and led the horses onwards its not worth stopping for my beauties said he addressing the horses youll see some rougher work by and bye if you stay with the gulyash pishta they reached the opposite bank and hastened on until they were again stopped by the water the gypsy wrung his handsthe

strength to get up and then you are done for hands off let go my bunda god will help me but i cannot leave my husband in this last extremity and she struggled to get down now susi be reasonable whats

studies in board schools our library table by charles morley smitn jsilder k jomr charles morley s reprints from a daily paper a series of illu e mina ting articles on the london board schools  and in their collected form they furnish material for coming to a fairly de6nite conclusion about the value of the elementary system at any rate they present many of the salient facts in a concrete shape and serve conveniently as an indication of our national gains and losses mr morley has inspected a number of typical schools in various parts of the metropolis and by dint of keeping his eyes open watching everything that he saw in a sympathetic spirit and taking copious notes he has put together a serviceable and diverting if somewhat slangy report much of what he says might have been gleaned from the bluebooks of the education department but there is a great deal more which is not to be found in the official records incidentally he mentions the cost the number and variety of the schools the curriculum the quality of the teaching the characteristics of masters mistresses and parents  and in place of mere bald statistics he lets us see the interior of the hive and draws a thousand pictures from the life which are sometimes more informing because more familiar and unreserved than the reports of her majestys inspectors in brief these thumbnail sketches of board schools and scholars as they actually are show us the great citizenfactory of the nation hard at work with all its processes complete from the collection of the raw material too often rank and halfcorrupted an

will scud swiftly to fleet street and invest in evening papers here is one case and the boy who leaves a board school to become a high wrangler and a fellow of his college is another in which the i in national system is justified of its children is u1 the system justified throughout and on the m whole  it is safe to say that a very large d majority of englishmen in spite of certain strictures in regard to religious teaching and of certain misgivings as to the overeducation of the masses are satisfied with the general outcome of the policy adopted in 1870 the deliberate intent of the nation is that its poorest children shall be systematically trained to citizenship and that by the same means aided by a simple process of continuation the clever minority shall be trained to teach the next generation or to start on a higher commercial or technical career or if that is their bent to pass out by way of the universities as for the fear of overeducating the masses we share it in common with all highly organised nations amongst whom we were the last to accept a national system it may be that the danger is real and that the overeducation of individuals by cultivating their intellect beyond their natural gifts and in excess of their economic needs is not a mere unsubstantial chimaera so far as there is any force in this objection the evil may be and generally is counteracted by the wisdom of school boards and board school teachers out of a hundred boys and girls freely and compulsorily educated by the state there is let us say one who is lifted into the welltodo professional

often make considerable sacrifices to attain it we regret however that the authoress cannot give a better account of their morals than will be found in the next passage their connexion with the

religious people they seem to be totally deficient in that deep reverential impression of sacred things which has so long and so favourably distilguished the scottish peasantry though almost

after reading poems epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragio in their incidents should find it very easy to say  there are compositions whioh may not be called idylls of such are these poems of the king i will not believe that even the shade of tennyson could be set aquiver by a quiet polite comment to that effect meanwhile it is here not so important to decide what is not an idyll as it is to deoide what an idyll is the word  idyll looked into is seen to mean  a little picture   and all the best idyllmakers from theocritus to jane barlow have given us little pictures for a little pioture it might naturally be supposed that one would ohoose a little subject a cottage rather than a castle little claus rather than big claus this again is what the best idyllmakers have always done even when the doing of it must have gone somewhat against the grain the great pastoral poet of greece makes an infamous act the theme of his eulogy because the doer of it was ptolemy the great pastoral poet of greece was partial to royalty but he did not make royalty dominate in his idylls lycidas was a goatherd goatherds harvestmen fishermenthese we meet in the famed idylls of greece very different they are from their brother  craftsmen whom we have known in the flesh if theocritus has drawn them truthfully the explanation of this fact is to be found in the time and the clime in which they lived their world was younger than ours by two thousand years the sky above them was a sicilian one well might they in the worlds youth and worlds garden live a life so free from care that they had to  make up  their sorrows 1 it is profitless perhaps but it is rather tempting to conjecture what would have happened to them if they had been sent  jumping oer times  the bold phrase is shaksperes to our time and if they had been brought to a standstill at lisconnel among goatherds harvestmen and fishermen in a world older by two thousand years with an irish sky over this bit of it among folk whose life is so laden with care that they have to  make up  their joys my feeling is that even lycidas who goatherd as he was could recite poems of his own composition upon occasion would have succumbed to what to any but a grey eye or soan irish eye would seem lamentably lacking in matter for poetry it is impossible to praise in excess the consummate skill with which miss barlow has made anew little pictures of the loveliest with this drear lisconnel for background and in the foreground nothing brighter than the blue of mrs kilfoyles cloak for what painters call a point of colour they who echo the famous german who said ich hasse ail zweitenmale may put down strangers at lisconnel at once  for it is nothing but what it calls itself  a second series of irish idylls no better than the first because better could not be but as good a fact which should be emphasised because there are people who think that as good could not be jerry dunnes basket is as witty as any story in the first series and is notable on another account till it appeared daudets little tale called  la mule du pape  was probably the best story of this kind yet told it is now the second best miss barlows being by just as much better than it as an irish toss of the head is bettermore sweet and commendablethan a french kick  jerry dunnes basket tells of an irish toss of the head and  la mule du pape  tells of a french kick of the pathetic stories more especially among them  mrs kilfoyles cloak  a good turn  boys wages  con the quare one i should like to write at great length but space forbids it is here possible only to give a few of the many passages in these tales and others which one marks as showing  the quality  of them we are taken out of the bogland for a look abrpad  the road climbs to the top of a hill and stops there abruptly as if it had been travelling all the while merely to look at the view there is only one writer living who could have written that and only one writer living who could have written this  the shower was a vicious one with the sting of sleet and hail in its drops pelted about by gusts that ruffled up the puddles into ripples all set on end like the feathers of a frightened hen as a sample of miss barlows own satire which is real irish point take this  ody was leaning against the wall critically examining brian kilfoyles blackthorn and forming a poor opinion of it with considerable satisfaction not that he bore brian any illwill but because this was his method of attaining to contentment with his own possessions sometimes there is a sounding of the profundities what was there in it asks thady before the beginnin of everything thady was a small anxiouslooking child whose pale and peaky face his mother often likened regretfully to a haporth of soap after a weeks washing he had spent a surprisingly considerable part of his six years in metaphysical speculations and was always disposed to make a personal grievance of the difficulties in which they constantly landed him his tone was now rather peremptory as he repeated what was there in it before the beginnin of everythin   sure nothin at all said his elder brother peter to whom the answer seemed quite simple and satisfactory but joanna looked as if ene had caught sight of some distant object which provoked hard staring   then what was there before the beginnin of nothin   pursued thady 4 dunno said peter indifferently  unless it was more nothin   sure not at all that wouldnt be the way of it joanna said dreamily yet with decision  if there was nothin but nothin in it thered ha been apt to not be eer an anythin ever whered it ha come from y dont be tellin the child lies peter why for one thing she said her tone sharpening polemically and taking a touch of triumph there was always god almighty in it and the divil maybe thats what you call nothin  peter evaded this point saying what peter said will be found in the tale called con the quare one i do not give it for two reasons i want the reader to go to the book and i want to give another passage you are to know that a theft has been perpetrated in lisconnel a thief has appeared there his appearance is followed by that of policemen it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of two active and stalwart civil servants would have been welcomed as happening just in the nick of time yet it argues an alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means possible the men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to the category of pitatyblights rintwarnins fevers and the like devastators of life that dog a man more or less all through it but close in on him a pitiful quarry when the bad seasons come and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin wid the hunger and his own heart is broke therefore to accept assistance from them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most reprehensibly unnatural to put a private quarrel or injury into the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the public foe a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a trivial temporary convenience lisconnel has never been skilled in the profitable and useful art of utilising its enemies not that anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments much less attempted to express them in set terms when a policeman appeared there was an inquiring mood what people said among themselves was  musha cock bim up i hope hell get his health till i would be tellin him or words to that effect while in reply to his questions they made statements superficially so clear and simple and essentially so bewilderingly involved that the longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle them there is a very general idea in england that irelands history has been written by moore lecky froude keating and some others and there has grown up a practice of late years of rather industriously studying these writers who are some of them interesting but are none of them quite reliable it is a curious fact that the writer who is the best historian that ireland has yet bad miss jane barlow is not only more reliable than any of the historians named above but is also immeasurably more interesting than any of them froude is considered by those who do not trust him wholly to have had a pretty wit it becomes very ugly when compared with wit like the above perhaps it is after all not for nothing that irish wit is accounted the prettiest

droll stories from the abbeys of touraine translated into english complete and un  abridged london chatto  windus 1874 people who reproduce recondite or obsolete literary garbage occupy a position which it is easy for them to defend and which it is difficult to assail to find fault with their wares is to advertise them and to expose the reviewer to the easy charge of prudery it often happens too that there is here and there a jewel hidden in the dunghills of the past some pure song among the many base ones of th6ophile vian some fact of historical value in the gossip of mrs aphra behn it is a pity that the student should not have such books always beside him as if the poorest student had not easy access to them in public libraries still there is this shadow of au excuse for many reprints of books which are meant to appeal only to prurient curiosity and when they are pro duced with some care and costliness in type and paper the chances are that they will not fall into the hands of readers whom they are likely to injure none of the excuses we have mentioned can be urged by the translator and the pub lishers of balzacs contes drolatiques the translator says in his preface in france the work has long been regarded as a classicas a faithful picture of the last days of the mayen dge when kings and princesses brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants in england the difficulties of the language employed and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the french of the sixteenth century taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages the archaeological value it must alwats possess for the student and the dramatic interest of its stories the translator has thought that an english edition of balzacs chef dceuvre would be acceptable to many no doubt it would and no doubt a translation of the marquis de sades chefdceuvres or of any other  scrofulous french novel would be acceptable to many but the translator like everyone else must be per fectly aware that the historical information of the book is absolutely worthless that it has no archaeological value at all except in the same sense as esmoncd has archaeological value that is as an imitation of the style and manners of the past and the style and lan guage of the contes drolatiques are not nearly so successful in this direction as esmond is the old french is like no old french in par ticular indeed it resembles nothing so much as the bastard old english of lady novelists who put ys for is and spell the ye and begin all the substantives with a capital letter there is no philological instruction to be got from this kind of thing and even if there were it would be lost in a translation to be sure the translator does his best by using some fine old examples of wellknown errors in english grammar such as  the wise man would lay at full length in a ditch to translate balzacs conte8 drolatiques then is inexcusable on historical or antiquarian grounds even beroalde de verville has the value of being the exponent of the nastiness of a past age but there is no historical value in a modern imitation of beroalde de verville and even if the cn ies were useful to the student a student so advanced ought to be able to read them in the original french nor has the book the excuse of being published at a price beyond the humblest purse or in a form meant to please the lover of beautiful typography it is got up like the boys books that are current at christmas and an illiterate but wellmeaning grand mother might probably give it to a boy now even the author would have objected to this for when balzac in the preface to the first edition defended his work as a work of art he also said that it was intended pour lea lecteura choiie the present translation appeals to the public at large to a public which has none of the education that would enable it to appreciate the art without taking harm from the grossness the contes drolatique is a fair example of the baser work of the romantic school of 1830 it deals with mediaeval themes and the author thoroughly enters into the horror and the lust which inform the grotesque of the middle ages in the voice and with a cracked imitation of the ringing laugh of rabelais he tells tales more filthy than any in the collection of the cure of meudon and morehateful in theircruelty than most that disgrace the records of crime in the middle ages theserecords are dreadful enough but they are at least human in their earnestness men were cruel because they were terrified but it is scarcely human to take such themes for art a gross age laughed grossly but there is something apish in the imitative and affected ribaldry of a refined age a cruel age acted with cruelty but there is something of the tiger in the artist who in a humane age gloats over torture like all balzac did his contes drolatiques are works of patient art look at the story of la succube it is a masterpiece of the romantic school the blind gropings of pedants in the mysteries of nature and of law are reproduced with the skill of michelet a glamour of moorish colour a savour of exotic fragrance hangs about the vampire but in place of the indignation of michelet there is only a sound of mocking laughter and everywhere in the book in every page we are reminded that this is the work of that balzac after reading whom saintebeuve said he felt like one unclean the book is full of art but to translate it for english people is to perpetrate another of the many crimes that are done in the name of art in this sabbat of satyrs and obscene witches among these foul scandals of monasteries and shadows of nameless sins there appears here and there the face of a woman that is not wholly vile or of a knight that was not merely a lecher but there is none of the tender poetry the pure love that redeem the coarseness of boccaccio the romantic school has scarcely produced a more hideous work or one so likely to do mischief in an english form the volume is illustrated with dores famous woodeuts now very worn and ob scure mr hamerton and mr ruskin did full justice to these drawings while they were still confined to a book that was not likely to find its way into schoolrooms it may be observed that the publishers have chosen to mutilate mr ruskins observations in their catalogue he did not end when he had said  nothing more witty nor more inventively horrible has yet been produced but went on thus in the evil literature or by the art of man nor can i conceive it possible to go beyond either in their spe cialities of corruption the honesty which mutilates criticisms for the purpose of advertisement is on a par with the sincerity which asserts that valuable historical and archaeological information

fmovel votes queen of the guarded mounts by john oxenham 6s hodder  stoughton the french revolution has furnished matter for many romances but rarely for one of more stirring and varied interest or more charm than fill the romance that is unfolded in the pages of  queen of the guarded mounts mr john oxenham has not taken the usual way of giving you pictures of the lurid doings in and around paris during the reign of the terror he introduces you to a little party of fugitive aristocrats who come over to england and are drawn to finding a haven of refuge on st michaels mount off the cornish coast because of its resemblance to mont st michel on the shore of brittany where their ancestral home had been this little party consists of the marquis de st aubin his daughter renee and his son michel and it is not long before the chief interest of the story centres on the delightful renee the marquis and his son return to brittany to play leading parts in a rising for the restoration of the bourbons and mainly through the mean duplicity and weakness of their exiled king all their loyal efforts are frustrated and when their followers are in hiding and they in prison in that mont st michel that had formerly been their home renee and certain of her english friends follow them out to brittany in the hope of rescuing them meanwhile on the english st michaels mount where she and her father and brother had won the hearts alike of the rugged fisher folk and the admirable little great persons of the village renee herself had found two lovers who prove the manliest and most generous of men in their rivalry the sketches of cornish fishermen and breton peasantry are very vividly realised and we meet among these people many sturdily likeable and quaintly humorous personalities the characterisation throughout is indeed excellent the story bristles with adventure and dramatic incident and is cunningly threaded with one of the most glamorously interesting of love idylls the descriptions of the country round about the two mounts are minutely and graphically picturesque and the sixteen photographic illustrations add to the attractiveness of the book  queen of the guarded mounts  is a fresh and cleverly written novel that will enhance mr oxenhams reputation with the general reader and is certain to enjoy as lasting a local popularity in the neighbourhoods of the french and english mounts as  lorna doone  does in the doone country,juvenile_contra
mrs matthews  or family mysteries a novel bv mrs trollope 3 vols london 1851 mrs trollopes works of fiction aie generally improbable in their plot exaggerated in their cha racters and somewhat coarse and vulgar in their treatment but there has hitherto been an energy and pungency about them which carry the reader with her she is often disagreeable but has never before been dull if one has a dislike to any particular class of persons it is especially amusing to follow mrs trollope through a three volume caricature of them but in the quiet and peaceful walks of taletelling this authoress is by no means so engaging a prizefighter hitting knockdown blows in the ring was a person of some interest to that happily extinct race of corinthians  who loved to see  punishment given and received but if the athlete doffed the champions belt and as has whilome happened took his seat in the house of commons he became a very dull inconsiderable unit now mrs trollope in  family mysteries is like a prizefighter turned legislator or justice of the peace there are indeed occasional very occasional snatches of satirical pugnacity she makes a high church clergyman connive at his sons running away with the daughter of a rich neighbour and she pictures the reverend gentleman as worldly obsequious and polemical she draws also a priest such as priest never was setting aside however these scintillations of mrs trollopes chronic hostility to the ministers of every creed and of every church the book is very much of the orderunreadable the story opens with a description of how mary king a mature spinster who bad seen half a century of winters engages to marry mr mathews a well to do bachelor of sixtytwo because her father pathetically implores her to do so upon the score that this overripe paternity was in grievous fear that when he was dead there would be nobody to sign receipts for rent or to see that the home meadows were properly drained mrs trollope however always makes the plot of her books turn upon a marriage settlement and the staid and wary mary king battles through a long chapter for  bookmoney ret pinmoney to the extent of jf500 ayear submitting in return to allow her intended a right to dispose of the united family fortune after her death to a certain illegitimate grandson of her sexagenarian lover mary king spinster had for thirtyfive years enjoyed a queerlooking room up stairs stuffed full of books  and there she had lived and worked she had laid up hidden stores of most unfeminine learning read latin with a heterodox fluency and spanish portuguese and other unknown tongues by the aid of her huge lexicons and borrowed grammars but mary king had once been nearly in love a certain john anderson had looked his wishes but had started for india and had not spoken them john anderson now writes to mary kingbecome a matrona letter telling ber that he had married and had survived his wife that he himself was now dying and that he had confided his daughter with about 7000 to her care after a long time the orphan arrives and so does the illegitimate grandchild and the mnage at weldon grange is complete then there is a sir charles otterborne whose principal peculiarities are an affectation of great cordiality a propensity to shake peoples arms out of their clavicle and a liking to the dice box there is lady otterborne pale anxiouslooking and with a thought a memory or a secret in her heart there is the handsome intellectual herbert the son of this couple and the hero of the novel moreover there are lords squires and retired merchants making up the county society the reader very soon discovers that janet anderson is every inch a heroine and that stephen cornington the grandson notwithstanding his superhuman beauty and very respectful flatteries is in every thought and act a swindler the instinct of a heroine of course preserves ber from falling in love with a swindler however handsome dashing and soft in song but herbert otterborneah that is a diferent matter herbert however is engaged to be married to emily steyton who is to receive jf80000 on the day of her marriage now emily steyton is very beautiful and very rich but she has two faults the first is if that be a fault in a lady that most imperiously she will have her own way the second that she falls in love with every new man she meets flirts desperately in drawingrooms loses her way in the woods during the progress of a picnic party and is brought back after some hours absence by the handsomest man in the companyhe not being her betrothed the end of this young ladys career is that she elopes with a very estimable young man of very pliable temperthe son of the parish parson that her father immediately forgives her and she becomes a happy wife the moral of course is that there is nothing for female happiness like a good heartless round of most compromising flirtation and a plunge into matrimony at last the swindler after hectoring about and making mrs matthews and everybody else very uncomfortable is found out st last there is a weakly worked scene of bis attempting to rob the house wherein he is frustrated by the hero of the piece sir herbert otterborne of course herbert and janet are duly married in the third volume herbert had only consented tb marry the heiress in ordr to release his father frbm his dfflculties and his mother from the imminently impending danger of being turned out of dobrs when the heiress ran awav therefore herbert was not inconsolable although sir charles felt bound in honour toblow his own brains otitthiseventhaving happened herbert and janet and mrs matthews and lady otterborhe become the jolliest of mortals and o the story ends we have omitted to state that when john andersons affairs were wound up he was found to have died insolvent and his laughter was therefore a pauper when fokind out by mrs matthews and brought to weldon grange we take up this stitch in order to make plain the following extract which is one of the best bits of the book  janets introduction to thk pricks the presentation of janet followed ami no stranger ever received a moue smiling welcome fox the teeth of father mother and laughterall for their respective ages particularly handsomewere fully displayed to do her honour and then bean the neighbourly chitchat 44 you have heard the news i presume my dear lady  said mr irice with the tone of a person who takes real interest in the subjrct discussed  the manorhouse nnd the lodge  of course you know that it is all settled  41 yes mr price sir charles announced it to us yesterday replied mrs mathews mr price smiled and nodded with a look of great intelligence 4 no wonder my good lady no wonder it is always pleasant to tell pleasant tidings the entrance of such a young wdy as miss emily steyton into a family might occasion joy anywhere bot hrrk you know i and having sait this mr price nodded his head and then shook his head and then nodded aain his eyes being fixed on mrs matthews all the time as if quite certain that she comprehended al he meant to express she give no indication of this however but looked very much as she might have done had she been made of iron or stone 44 it will be a very gay affair i suppose said mrs price taking up as it were her husbands nodding process and going on with it 44 have you almost finished your rug miss louisa  said mrs matthews lo the daughter ot the house who had never suspended for a moment the action of her needle though the sympathetic movement of her flaxen head showed that she too took a lively interest in the conversation all the energy of ber character however was immediately turned into another channel by the question of mrs mathews 44 finished  why dear mrs mathews we only began it this time twelvemonth t i dont think any one can accuse either mamma or roe of being idle but i cant even pretend to giwss when it will be nniahed i believe you forget that it is all tent stitch  yes i did said mrs mathews 44 oh  that jut makes all the difference you know is miss anderson a worker  44 not mach i beltevw said mrs mathewswho bytheby had never made any inquiry on the subject and knew hq more of janets propensities in that line than of those of heir grandmother 44 oh  ym mrs mathews said janet reproachfully 44 i sm a very great worker i make everything i wear why mrs matthews should frown so very harshly upon hearing this poor janet could not tell neither could she guess why she should be so rude aa to say to her  nonsense my dear ybu should never tell fibs janet andersoh even in jest it is possible that janet might have attempted some defence against this vehement attack upon her veracity which was ss undeserved as it was unexpected for janet very literally had made everything she had on 44 four cause tb borrow a significant phrase for if she had not her mantuamakers bill must have been paid by charity but no opportunity was afforded her for mrs mathews rather abruptly turning her back upon her addressed mr price   i suppose this wedding will take place in london sir  this looked very much as if mrs matthews was not in a good humour for as she probably knew perfectly well it would have been very difficult for her to have said anything more painfully grating to the feelings of mr price than these words mr prices wishes were probably none of them very vehement or impassioned but rarely or never had he wished anything more earnestly than that the heir of the manorhouse and the heiress of the lodge should be united in the band of holy matrimony in his church aud that he himself should pronounce the nuptial benediction  did sir charles say so  demanded he with his usual gentle accent but not without betraying a little agitation  i am not quite sure whether he did or not replied his tormentor but it is much more likely i think than that tlny should be married here poor miss louisa actually turned pale as she listened to these words for she was honoured by the intended bride with a greater degree of intimacy than she bestowed upon any gther young lady in the neighbourhood and in her very heart of hearts she had both hoped and expected that she should be selected as one of the bridesmaids had mrs matthews happened to look at her at that moment instead of looking at her mother she would hardly have had the cruelty to persevere in her fabulous statement for the woebegone expression of her pretty little face was piteous to behold but unfortunately the attention of mrs matthews was just then attracted to the generally very unmeaning countenance of her mamma but which at that moment was considerably less unmeaning than usual for her eyes were earnestly directed to the thin and not very new black silk of which poor janets homemade suit was composed and there was much too decided an expression ot scorn in the curl of her lip and her countenance to have been called unmeaning at that moment mrs matthews saw it all and understood it all which might be an evidence perhaps of the acuteness of her observation  but the result was certainly not an evidence of the goodness of her temper for abruptly turning to mr price she said in her clear distinct voice which rarely permitted any word she uttered to be unheard or its meaning misunderstood  things seem to be going rather sharply against though oxford gentry mr price particularly in out neighbourhood if all that i hear be true i am told that dr belton is to be the new dean and he is eositively the roost thoroughly lowchurch divine that we ave  dont call him a divine my good lady i do mo9t humbly beg and entreat tint i may not near any such epithet applied to him we have fieldpreachers mrs mathews fieldpreachers and streetpreachers in abundance who are ten times more orthodox than he is cried mr price with a degree of vehemence that brought a deep flush to the very roots of his grey hair  he is an absolute infidel on many points ho added with a sijjh  and a most audacious dissenter on othersand as to the rubric i know that he said     never mind what he has said mr price and if you will believe me you had better begin to speak of him with a little more civility and a great deal more caution for if they are going to make a dean of him now you may be very sure that it will not be very long before he is rhaden bishop and when that is done mr price i feel quite sure that your own sense ot propriety will make you very sorry for anything you have ever spoken against him you know sir we are told that  a binhoj must be blamelen and that upon such authority as you will not choose to deny but do not let us talk any more about it there can be no doubt i believe that dr belton will be a bishop and therefore though less we any of us say against him the better poor imr price was fortunately rather a thin man and his pulse constitutionally beat time very temperately for had it been otherwise he might have been in danger of an attack of apoplexy for he was at that moment as greatly irritated as lt was in his nature to be and very justly too perhaps mrs matthews was aware of this for she suddenly let him alone and was meditating making a generous atonement for all her misdemeanours by looking at and admiring the immortal hearthrug when must unluckily she perceived that the eyes of miss louisa were now engaged erecisely in the same manner that those of her mamma bad een a few minutes before in short mrs matthews very clearly perceived that ihe dress and accoutrements of john andersons daughter were undergoing a scrutiny which they were by no means particularly well calculated to stand and this was a great deal more than it was in her nature to bear with patience she felt it the more too because she wss conscious that she had been herself most culpably unobservant on this point she had looked certainly more than once in the face of janet and found it lovely she had studied its varying expression and found more than one look that set her thinking a great deal more about the looks ef the father in days past than of the dress of the daughter in days present but thia was ber own fault and not that of neat nice welldressed mrs price and her fair louisa i and had mrs matthews been a little more reasonable abd a little less revengeful she would not have left the parsonage so mightily wellpleased with the idea of having made herself as disagreeable to its inhabitants as it was well possible for her to do during the very moderate interval that shs permitted her

said the owner an uncle who had fought under clive his maiden sister and their nieceall johnstones of alva if memory serves aright that group has been recalled by this most charming book which like the picture suggests a scotch jane austen much more janeaustenish than susan ferrier its author elizabeth grant was born in edinburgh may 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in bombay cathedral to col afterwards general henry smith of baltiboys lived thereafter in ireland and died november 16th 1885 she was the eldest of the five childrentwo sons and three daughtersof sir

in 1790 to the rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle he was an edinburgh advocate and london barrister sat as whig member for grimsby and tavistock and in 1827 having frittered away his 2000 a year and gone bankrupt was appointed a judge in bombay and knighted later he was chief justice at calcutta these memoirs written by mrs smith for her children during 184567 come down only to 1830 and record her life in london at thorley hall hertfordshire at the doune in rothiemurchus on speyside at university college oxford of which dr james griffith one of her numberless cousins was

of the kind has proved more delightful  if ever i write a novel mrs smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten inspector and received 40 in return that rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel as it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past here is one that is truly wordsworthian the young people were not of rothiemurchus they lived up in glen feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married he was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man i am not sure which but his business was to mind a large hock that pastured on the mountainsat the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty the wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for

of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to

highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second

folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it the account of the old edinburgh society is entertaining she classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary she met all varietiesthe jeffreys sir david brewster  the crazy lord buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of queen marys and a bone of james the fifth harry erskine john clerk of eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and sir walter himself there is also a welldrawn portrait of canning whom she met in holland she is most fearless in confessing her opinions she confesses that she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  a coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the dukes arms at dunkeld to blair during the summer season the announcement read as follows pleasing intelligence the duchess of athol starts every morning from the  dukes arms at eight oclock the other is told of lord eldin  some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the west country celebrated in his life for drawing

than to write a book which should have all the drawbacks of the fictitious method for the treatment of serious subjects and yet neither in plan nor in manner have anything of a philosophical a scientific setting forthwhich should be a narrative and yet not be a story which should broach and even obtrude the most complex and urgent problems of the day and yet should in the most haphazard

fiction the prelude to adventure by hugh walpole mfills  boon 6s i cannot help regretting that mr walpole did not think of and write this prelude to adventuyre before some most fortunate inspiration gave him the theme of mr paron and mr trail criticism and comparison would then have been so easy and so agreeable one would have said that this extremely clever and promising young writer having written a remarkable and interesting novel had gone on to write one much more interesting and remarkable had found a subject at once fresh and familiar exactly fitted to his gifts of patient analysis and of expressing an atmosphere had found himself and come into his own and all that unfortunately the more interesting book came first the careful critic however is by no means compelled to reverse what he would have said there is no falling off in any sense which should disappoint those who hoped great things of mr walpole grasp of subject delicacy of perception and expression power of bringing an atmosphere home to the readerall this is just as apparent as before only the subject is not so good not nearly so good that is all the tragedy of an inferior schoolmasters life with the gradual warping of a naturally decent temperament the narrow jealousies growing intenser the continually exacerbated nerves ending in madness was a fine tragedy it took one for the first timeat least so far as my own reading is concernedbehind certain scenes into the real humanity of a rather despised and insignificantly obvious figure the story of a young man who kills another by accident and is gradually driven to confess has no such interest it would not have even if one altogether believed in it and that for my part i cannot do consider olva dune is a proud and contemptuous youtha little too much so for my sympathiesof a proud and contemptuous race but is on the whole a saneand sensible young man verygood he meetsanother lad in a lonely wood quarrels with him andin a fit of quite justified ragehits him as hard as he can on the chin and the blow kills him now both dune and mr walpole treat this unfortunate fatality as though it was murder in the same degree as if he had out with a knife and stabbed the other boy that is really absurd and i do not believe this clearheaded and courageous youth would have taken it so for a moment he would have recognised that he had had very bad luck as though he had killed somebody by accident at footer or in the ringa piece of bad luck which no doubt would overshadow his early manhood but which was not unbearable especially as he did not really repent the death of the other who was a blackguard and he would have gone at once and said what he had done and there would have been no story given this as i think initial improbability the rest is finely worked out the emotional form which the desire of confession takes is a matter of temperament and to me the sense of an outside presencegod in factcontinually prompting confession is not so closely imaginable as the other motive a feeling of intense loneliness in the possession of a damning secret that is good and so is the idea of his suddenly confessing to a fool the worst confidant he could have had as for the atmosphere it is less interesting than that of the masters common room at the inferior public school undergraduates may be often very jolly companions but the only psychological interest in very young men is in an emotional phase for which the university gives no scope and which therefore is rightly omitted in the novel dunes love for a friends sister is little more than common form such as it is the life of the undergraduates is exactly pictured by no means a matter of course merely because mr walpole is happily near his own experience of it had there been no mr perrin this successor would have been acclaimed more warmly less unequivocally hard luck i think not it is a small price to pay for such a rare inspiration as that g s s,juvenile_contra

fiction i passages in the life of mrs magiaret maitland of i sunnyside written by herself in 3 vols london colburn 1849 tins is of a class of novels which we hold in great esteemwhose purpose is the quiet gradual and natural development of a domestic drama such as might be played at any time in any country town within the four seas we have little regard for the spasmodic romances which strain after a new excitement in every chapter and to maintain the readers curiosity are compelled to make each one more outrageous than its predecessor such tales as that betorc us are better calculated to make a permanent impression upon the memory while they are far more wholesome entertainment than the class of which they are antipodes galt is manifestly our authoresss model and the only fault we have to find with her is that she has been too faithful to her teacher and has not sufficiently trusted to her own indubitable powers which would have enabled her had she dared to be original like most imnitators of a style she has copied not alone the excellences but the detects also of her model and the former she has somewhat weakened by over elaboration one of the most remarkable characteristics of galt was a terseness of expression which enabled him to throw a 1rge thought into a small sentence so that frequently he was almost epigrammatic now the authoress of them passages has not this faculty of condensation and so while closely adhering to the cast of thought which made galt so dear to his readers she puts it into many more words hence it would have been better for her fame if she had compressed this novel into two volumes as well she might have done the incidents not being very numerous may we hope that in her next endeavour she will remember that it is no longer essential to a novel that it should fill exactly three volumes it may be one or two or three or four according to the actual necessities of the plot the passages in the life of mrs margaret maitland display an uncommon insight into character and unusual power in its portraiture the development of that of the supposed narrator witl whom we contract an acquaintance gradually and learn to know better every day just as with friends in real life is a masterpiece the maiden gentlewoman is here exhibited to us as she is more often found in the world than in the pages of fictions a good kind unselfish selfsacriticing being living to serve others and finding her happiness in that service there is in her no one peculiarity or oddity but yet he stands out in the memory as distinctly individualised as if she bad been one of the beings whom we had ipersonally known and loved and not a mere shadow conjured by the fancy of a novelist the dominic is another reality of the same race as scorrs but how different in species so it is with many of the others of the mystery that makes the plot of this novel we will not dropl a hint save that there is an appearance and a disappearalcle and a revelation all profoundly interesting which must be sought in the volumes themselves it is riot perhaps a work that will satisfy the circulating library cormorant whose jaded appetite seeks some stirnulara of strangeness or horror but it will charm the donmestic circle gathered round the christmas fireside arid moreover will be to them a right wholesome entertainment for its teachings and its morals are perfect we regret only that it should be so very scotch we cannot afford more than one passage as a specimen t of the style though we might cull many it shall be a sketch of lif at

light figureher slender waisther small handsher elastic stepher graceful carriagewere all so pleasant and attractive that it was difficult not to follow her with your eyes as she moved about the room doing her spiriting gently and with a ready cheerfulness which made you feel that it was no taskwork to her there was something too very open in her manner she waa not forward or immodest but there was a dangerous kind of unreserve about her which might have been misunderstood it was in reality nothing but frankness and cordialitybut with people less singleminded than herself it placed ber at a disadvantage andit ruined ber at last how mr arnold may tell it has been necessary that i should write this much in explanation to render intelligible what fell from the good mans lips he asked me if i knew that jessie hart had returned home and i answered that i had heard a vague story about her returnbut that i hoped what i heard was untrue  untrue alas sullivan and there was a deep and sorrowful solemnity in bis voiceif what you heard wasa story of poor jessies shameand if you heard associated with it the name of gilbert arnold my son it was not untrue i could say nothing and he continued  sullivan i hope i am not uncharitable i hope i am not intolerant i do not think that in a harsh or unforgiving spirit i ever viewed the errors of the youngi know what are their temptations i know that feeling for the most part is stronger than principle within themthat passion is headstrong irresistible that there are some allurements not to be withstood it is often permitted to us sullivan righteously to pity whilst we condemn for those who love over much there is always some pity to be claimedwe say the sinner was a loving one and we shed a tear over the sin if my son had come

johnny robinson the story of the childhood and sclwoldays of an  intelligent artisan by the journeyman engineer 2 vols tinsley brothers  the journeyman engineer who is known favourably to many readers by  some habits and customs of the working classes gives us a picture of the boyhood of a prosperous london artisans child from his infancy to the commencement of his apprenticeship to a working engineer to rouse and hold the readers interest the book makes just no use of the ordinary devices of romantic artists but achieves its purpose by a simple statement of the ordinary experiences of a boy who passes his earlier years in a mechanics home and in the schools generally frequented by the more carefullyreared children of our superior london workmen how johnny robinson fares under the penal hand of a worthy mother the birch of the kindly dame who teaches him his letters and the canes of the masters who ground him in the three fundamental departments of learning is minutely set forth for the enlightenment of leaders who like to study the ways and manners of our poorer classes and for the entertainment of such youngsters as those whom the book describes the characters of johnnys schoolmates are delineated and contrasted with considerable ability and in his enumeration of the moral dangers that beset the humble but respectable lads of our large cities the journeyman engineer  gives us some noteworthy particulars concerning a vicious literature that is specially provided for their entertainment and injury but while the effects of cheap literature have been chiefly beneficial it has like other good things its attendant evils and chiefest among these in the present day is the extensive circulation of the kind of publications classed under the expressive heading of  thieves literature these works which are having a most pernicious effect upon boys in the working class rank of life are published in penny weekly numbers and at the commencement of their present runwhich set in soon after the abolition of the paper dutythey were published under such general but suggestive titles as black bess or the knight of the road and  the dashing highwayman general titles however were soon abandoned and these works now appeal directly to the class whose minds they chiefly corrupt by bearing such titles as  the boy brigand the boy piratethe wild boys of london and others of a like character the sole object of these works is the glorification of all descriptions of vice and criminality the boy hero is invariably represented as a daring and successful criminal leading a life of pleasurable excitement admired and obeyed by men beloved of women and eventually settling down with a rich and beautiful wife and the other rewards generally reserved for the virtuous heroes of ordinary works of fiction the whole tone of such publications ia eminently calculated to turn the spirit of adventure which characterises english boys to their own destruction as it teaches them to emulate not the deeds of great men but of notorious criminals the extent to which these publications circulate can only be fully realised by those inside the working classes and speaking from an intimate acquaintance with these classes i can confidently say that eighty per cent of the boys in this rank of life between eight and fifteen years of age who do read now read works of this class cases in which boys are led to commit robberies through the perusal of these publications are occasionally made known through the medium of the police intelligence but these are a very small proportion of the number of such cases that actually occur such robberies being for the most part from parents who do not as a rule make them public the depredations of the boys who are thus led into crime are committed either with a view to obtaining money wherewith to purchase the books or to carry out the lessons taught in them by setting up as  boy brigands or pirates on their own account and in connexion with this point it may be noticed that there is one feature in the publication of thieves literature that directly tends to induce the classes who are its principal readers to steal with a number of one of them the first two numbers of a new work of the same class is often  given away and these works being written upon the most intense  tobecontinued  principle the result of this dodge is that those who commence to take in one of these works are almost invariably involved into taking several others of the same class asit would beagainstthe nature of a reader of thieves literature to rest content without knowing the result of the  terrible encounter between the boy king of the mountains and the chief of the black bandits at the most exciting part of which the last of the two givenaway numbers of  the boy king of the mountains had terminated and thus it often happens that one boy is taking in five or six of these works at the same time and as the pocketmoney of workingclass boys is too limited in amount to allow of the expenditure of fivepence or sixpence a week in one article and the teaching of the works which they read is in effect that no boy of the least spirit would for a moment hesitate about committing a robbery these boys often resort to dishonest means to raise funds for the purchase of their favourite books what mr hughes accomplished for

the celtic twilight men and women dhoula and faeries by w b yeats lawrence  bullen it was math the magicianthe same math that formed the maiden blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today mr yeats is perhaps the one true follower of math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his in it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of oisin and cuchulain and if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his the celtic twilight will still remain to the saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and fairies will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before but to those who believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,juvenile_contra

there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,juvenile_contra
1 the doctors wife ts new novels by the author of lady audleys secretc 3 vols maxwell  co in the october of 1862 we noticed lady audley  secret and in october 1864 we are about to review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his

commending the lady to the protection of his family mr lansdell dies penitent leaving the bulk of his vast property to isabel and his murderer escapes to america thus freed from her plebeian husband

myths and legends of the bantu by alice werner 15s harrap the anthropological journalist who wishes to present the result of his researches in the form which used to be known as  suitable for household reading is confronted with very great difficulties one cannot blame him for confining his reports to the scientific journals when the penalty for venturing outside their covers is to be listed in the booksellers catalogues under  curious if he is not a good story teller or if he is a stickler for exactitude he had better confine himself to the journal but if he is skilful enough to tell a story well within the prescribed limits then he must be encouraged to come out and tell it to us because a good story is always worth while the tragedy is that robbed of so much it will remain nothing more than a story where formerly it had held an importance amounting to an article of religion and its recital even an exposition of faith however the collector of these stories is a woman and she can tell them exceedingly well and her book strictly speaking does not pretend to be an anthropological study in answer to the question  who are the bantu  it may be instructive to quote dr werners reply that bantu is now the generally accepted name for those natives of south africa the great majority who are neither hottentots nor bushmenthat is to say mainly the zabus xosas thafins basuto and bechuanato whom may be added the thongas shangaans of the delagoa bay region and the people of southern rhodesia commonly though incorrectly called mashaud it will be seen that this list covers a great variety of racial types the tall stronglymade zulu differing vastly from the short and sturdy pokomo canoeman and the overtall and toothin men of the hereros from the small active and wiry anyanja of nyasaland so it is misleading to speak of a bantu race the remarkable and binding feature about these peoples is that their language possesses almost identically the same grammar differing no more than french does from spanish or english from danish where it originally came from and how it spread no one knows although conjecture has it that it came from somewhere in the region of the great lakes and spread towards the south and east about two or three thousand years ago the mass of the stories are what one may term ghost stories that is they concern themselves mwith the spirits of the dead this is not unnatural when the main feature of the religion consists of a cult of the dead and the belief in a high god if not entirely forgotten has become very vague the dead may return in the form of animals so animal stories are in a preponderance too among these we find the original characters of the  uncle remus  stories only it was not until the negroes reached the american slave plantations that brer rabbit took the place of the hare of an africa that knows no rabbit south of the sahara perhaps the strangest case of diffusion although dr werner generally disagrees with the diffusionist theory of fairystories is the case of sops fables the thirtyfirst chapter of the koran is called the chapter of lokmaan a great fabulist among the arabs and a man reputed to have known david he was a black manan ethiopian and it is supposed that he is no other than the 2esop of the greeks today he circulates again in the country of his origin translated back again into the vernacular along with the recent introductions of grimms fairy tales,juvenile_contra

hindoo tales or the adventures of ten princes freely translated from the san scrit of the dasakuinaracharitam by p w jacob strahan  co wk gladly welcome this handy translation of the  dasakumaracharitra feeling sure that the more english readers become acquainted with indian literature the better will they be able to understand indian questions to appreciate and sympathise with the thoughts and feelings of the many millions of their indian fellow subjects with most of the versions of oriental works intended for scholars and students the general reader is not likely to have much inclination to make acquaintance but a free translation of a storybook like that which is now before us ought to find general f kvour very free indeed the translation is but mr jacob is fully justified in remarking that many parts of the original  are written in such a turgid  oriental stylo that a close translation would bo quite unsuitable to the english reader we have no fault to find with him on that score but we are surprised that an interpreter who professes to have translated so difficult a piece of sanskrit as the adventures of ten princes should have stated that it  has not so far as he can ascertain  been translated into any european language we do not expect  every schoolboy  to be aware but it seems strange that an advanced sanskritist should be unaware that the work in question has been translated into french by m hippolyte fauche in vol ii of  vue tetrade icc paris 1802 and that it has already been treated by no less a scholar than prof wilson in very much the same style as that in which mr jacob has now treated it as m fauches translation however is but little known here while prof wilsons abridged paraphrase is not easily to be obtained it forms pp 100289 of vol iv of his collected works we can conscientiously recommend mr jacobs attractive little book as prof wilson remarks the stories now before us  are interesting as pictures of hindu society for ceuturies probably anterior to the mohammedan conquest not very flattering pictures are they he proceeds to say for pro fligacy and superstition seem to be their most characteristic features but still there are redeeming traits their heroes being brave and enterprising devoted to their friends and kindred and tenderly attached to the objects of their affection seen from another point of view the stories wear a more attractive aspect inasmuch as they ofter a valuable contribution to the stock of materials available for the use of those engaged in the comparative study of folklore one of the beat of the stories and the most useful for such purposes is that of mantragupta who one night finds a terrible enchanter standing beside a flickering fire  his head covered with a large mass of tangled hair his body begrimed with the dust of charcoal and a girdle of human bones round his waist from this unpleasant magician the hero saves a fair princess sending the enchanters head flying at the moment when he is about to cut off hers after performing this useful act he naturally marries her but before long she is carried away captive by a neighbouring king who proposes to make her his wife the monarchs intentions however are frustrated by the fact that she suddenly becomes  possessed by an evil spirit whose rage is greatest whenever the king visits her when mantragupta hears this he disguises himself as an ascetic proceeds to the kings court and induces the amorous sovereign to follow his instructions these are that the king shall visit a certain tank at midnight and bathe in its waters by this means he will acquire  a new and beautiful body acceptable to the lady and she will no more be troubled with the evil spirit the monarch does as he is bid and is pulled under water aud strangled by his instructor who has lain in wait for him in a hole constructed for the purpose in the dam then mantragupta conies forward and exhibits himself as the improved king to the royal attendants who have been drawn up in the neighbourhood and who  though they had expected a miracle were scarcely prepared for such a great change after which he assumes the reins of government is married in state to his own wife and becomes the delight of his subjects who are never weary of pointing out how much the temper of their sovereign has improved together with his personal appearance very curious also are the two stories told by mitragupta to the rakshasa in proof of his assertions that there is nothing more cruel than  a wicked womans heart and nothing so conducive to  the advantage of a householder  as  good qualities in a wife according to the first story a certain man had saved his wifes life by enabling her to escape from her brothersinlaw who wished to eat her and had preserved it by draughts of his own blood when no other aliment could be obtained during their flight in spite of all this she transferred her affections from him to a mere torso of a man a wretched being whom he had found in the forest left to die there by robbers who had cut off his hands feet and nose so one day she pushed her husband into a well then she carried away the cripple on her back and proceeded to pass him off though much against his will as her lawful spouse mean time her real husband escaped i from the well and followed her about the country when at last he came up with her she promptly gave him in charge as the ruffian who had mutilated her poor dear husband the cripple and the innocent man would have been put to an ignominious death had he not appealed to the cripple who at once  with many tears declared the kindness with which he had been treated by the supposed criminal and the wickedness of the woman who had forced him to live with her as her husband the second story is that of the wealthy young brahman who  in the country of the dravidas plays the wellknown part of  ccelebs in search of a wife in order to find a suitable spouse he wanders from one town or village to another  taking very little with him but a small bag containing two or three pounds of rice in the husk and whenever he sees a maiden of his own caste whom he admires he says to her  my dear could you make me a good dinner with this rice  time passes by and the rice remains uncooked  but at last he finds a maiden whose personal charms completely captivate him but although urged by love he is still restrained by prudence so he addresses her with his usual formula she at once takes the rice gently rubs it so as  to get off the husk unbroken sends her nurse to sell the husk to the goldsmiths and to purchase with the proceeds  a little firewood a few cheap dishes an earthen pipkin and a wooden mortar with a long pestle all of which objects must have been very cheap or bran very dear then she gracefully cleanses and washes the rice lights a fire and boils the grain puts out the fire sells the charcoal obtained from it and lays out its price in  herbs ghee curds tamarind fruit spices salt myrobalan and sesamum oil sends out the brahman to bathe having supplied him with the means of oiling himself after his bath gives him an appetising meal on his return and then sits down beside him arranging her scanty patched dress as well as she is able whereupon he proposes for her hand and marries her and she makes him so excellent a wife that even when  he took to himself another wife a woman of bad character she  continued to treat her husband with all due honour and respect and so gained over her fellowwife that she became her dearest friend,juvenile_contra

in our pages if a few gossiping novel readers and several periodical publications had not pronounced it to be a work of pathos and beauty far exceeding all the julia de ltoubignes and charlotteandwerters in the whole romantic world of letters we have been entreated by several soft readers to walk as a short cut to the temple of pure feeling through some of the passages in mr adam blairs life and we have at length yielded to these intreaties and tried this literary half penni hatch leading through the gardens of sensibility and the flowers of morality to the temple itself the dust we use the mildest wordthe gloomthe tediousness of tnese  passages  have been to us so offensive that we have determined upon running our critical broom through them to make the way clearer and the darker turns lighter for all future travellers in the tender line the title of this book would lead all simple hearted christians into the belief that it treated of struggles of the spiritthat it contained heartsearching admonitionsfearless and patient controversieslonely and pious meditationsreasoningsexhortationsprayers let such readers put up the little swindler on the shelf again and return to some old favourite and assured author for mr adam blair is not the man for their money if there be any controversies they arise between mr adam the minister and the husband of his  adored charlotte if any meditations exist they are the meditations of a couple of holy and young scotch creatures who make love in a moonlight churchyard on the tombstone of the deceased and buried mrs blah if there be any heartsearching admonitions they are merely uttered by the young clergyman to reprove the fallen wife for the errors into which he had helped her in short the lovers of tillotson and south and taylor and of those who have breathed consolation to the miserableand spoken quiet happiness to the goodmust stand aside and turn a deaf eye to the present discourse but let the followers of the rev mr welter and the rev mr de roubigne and the kev mr lovelace and the rev mr abelard and indeed of all the canting ministers in the sect of sensibility come around us while we expound the dark passages of the life of mr adam blair of crossmeikle  ave can promise a genuine lovefeast to the tenderly devout at least and now seeing in our minds eye a goodly congregation of the maudlin flock gaping in their parlourpews we will shortly tell the good tale our own way expounding as we proceed mr adam blair is the minister of crossmeikle and appears to be very comfortably settled in life and in tinfirst passage with a comely wife and a decent allowance of bairns in fact a very moderate allowance for a gentleman of his cloth his children being four only in number mrs blair and himself are unlucky iii their rearing of them and three of the little cherubs are carried off with the measles or some such inelegant but fatal disorder it occurs to us that mrs blair is not like most mothers if the book is to be credited  for it states that  after the death of the last of these three infants mrs blair dried her tears  however this was her business and not ours and perhaps her subsequent regular death may be some atonement she dies in the third or fourth page which is certainly early work and indeed we had fears that the denouement was coming at the wron end of the book  but we soon found as we shall explain anon that the minister had to undergo  severer chastening or in other words that with all the domestic happiness of the dean and chapter thefirst chapter all the ecstasies were to come immediately after the ladys death what  edinburgh lr does the rev mr blair dowrhv after closing  the stiffening eyelids over the soft but ghastly orbs kissing the brow the cheek the lips the bosom of the defunct  he rushes bareheaded into the fields and then listen what follows  there is an old thick grove of pines almost immediately behind the house and after staring about him for a moment on the green he leapt hastily over the little brook that skirts it and plunged within the shade of the trees the breeze was rustling the black boughs high over his head and whistling along die bare ground beneath him he rushed he knew not whither on and on between those naked brown trunks till he was in the heart of the wood and there at last he tossed himself down on his back among the withered fern leaves and mouldering firtones mr blair in this situation dreams with his eyes open of a young radiant woman mrs blair that was  blushing trembling smiling panting on his bosom whispering to him all ber hopes and fears and pride and love and tenderness and meekness like a bride and  all that sort of thingile soon returned home in considerably better spirits and his servants let him in and went to bed the minister takes on sadly and really appears to grieve after the style of la roche and almost as perfectly as the original isle gets his wiles picture and puts it opposite his bed  and he gets together all her odd volumes of the ladys magazine and the novelists  and diets his taney on her early prettinesses the little sarah too the pledge of their affection the only

mrs semple the widow of the ministers patron mrs semple is a good woman and is very kimi to sarah at her house mr blairs sorrow begins to thaw and there is every promise ol a mild spring when the widow is lilied to edinburgh and the widow er is left to pine away as usual at crossmeikle at this time mr blair receives a letter from mrs charlotte campbell an old fr iendof mrs blair theseyoung old friends of a first wife are extremely dangerous cattle offering him a visit as her husband mr campbell in the india service would not bc home for a twelvemonth she gives no opportunity for a refusal as she follows her letter instanter captain campbell it appears is a second husband of the youthful and elegant charlotte and in proof of her delicacy and refinement we give the description of the ladys choice the captain campbell of charlotte was in almost every respect unlike the curlyheaded boy who had preceded him in her good graces he was a thickmade squarebuilt sturdy highlander with what are commonly called heatherlegs anglicc bandy his nose had been blown up a good deal by snuff and brandy or both his eyes were keen grey his hair eyebrows and whiskers bristly red his bobmajor dressed amervcule and his dutch uniform fine as fivepence mrs campbell arrives pale and comfortless from a discontented marriage as the author shrewdly hints  but a very short time at the parsonage plumps up her cheeks and makes her cpiite another woman mrs campbell strays out in the midnight to the tomb of mrs blair of course to read blairs grave she reads the inscription on the tomb and then reflectsand then moralises  and then philosophizesand then sighs and passionate sobs burst together unchecked and unresisted and the bruised heart poured out all its luxury of tears she lifted her eyes to the moon and the stars and the beautiful heavens and her eye spake reproachfully to their beauty  why oh why are ye eternal bright eyes not shining on my graveon my repose  isabel loved and was loved and was happy  i loved and was never loved again i sought refuge where thc foolish seek it and i found what they find oh why was i not the wife of blair one year not ten long blessed yearswould have been

there stood adam blair of course say all novel readers she was iii her night dress and adam was quite astounded but the touch of blairs hand upon charlottes neck and still more something already alluded to had effectually disturbed the tenor of her meditations mr blair and mrs campbell read walked talked together and he became more cheerful and she fattened and became merrier and in short the goodnatured people at crossnieikle began to gossip about the holy friendly and fascinated pair the minister and the wife of the indianian talk on matters of religion until they get tender charlotte is all the better for adams lectures and he is the better for giving them at length she becomes candid and mrs campbell tells mr blair her long story which ends thus confidingly    i toiled for him said

once more they shed sympathetic tears and once more they parted on one very fine june day blair proposed to charlotte to walk to semplehaugh mrs semples and they took sarah and realised the proposal on this occasion mrs campbell never looked betterthe author says that if titian had seen charlotte he would have jumped at her ber form although with somewhat of a matronlike air had preserved its outline as perfect as it was at bright seventeen  her full anns were rounded with all that delicate firmness which albano delighted to represent in his triumphant seanymphs the clear brown of her check had banished its once steady roses hut that did not prevent an occasional hush of crimson from being visibleif the curls of lier hair were not quite so silky and slender tluy were darker and ridler and more luxuriant than they ever had beenand a slight heaviness about the lids did not diminish the effect of her beautiful black liquid eyes whenever they ceased to be downcast it was the fashion of the day to wear two or three long ringlets of hair down on the shoulder and never did glossier ringlets float upon a fairer bosom than hers the day passes  mighty agreeable and the party dine and walk and chat very innocently in the midst of the most interesting dialogue between a bunch of old tabbies a violent scream alanns the reader and the company mr blair and miss sarah are floundering about in the pond and mrs campbell having been bit in her youth by a newfoundland dog plunges in and saves the minister by the hair of his head mercy on us  had he been an english bishop his wig would have been his ruin a ve will now show the water party just landed and we must say the wet appears to have completely taken the starch out of their morals mrs campbell was on her knees stooping over the child soothing and caressing her with whispers and kisses and apparently quite unconscious either of what she herself had undergone or of the state in which her exertions had left her person her hair as we have already seen had been flung loose at the beginningsic had lost her shawl her neckkerchief her cap all the lighter parts of her dress in the progress of the struggle and in short she was now as thinly and as moistly clad as any goddess or nymph of the sea that ever guido drew or flaxman modelled mr blair who had stood for a moment with his arms folded upon his breast as if half bewildered with so many sudden transitions now fell upon his knees close beside  harlotte and his child and throwing one arm mund each bc drew them both towards his bosom and began to kiss them alternately cheek and brow and lip and neck hastily and passionately as if ignorant or careless that they were within sight of any one mrs semple who has an eye to decency gets the lady to retire

very nearly to cut off the minister and the catastrophe this is an ingenious and moving incident a moment after the bolt was withdrawn  the door sprung open and charlotte rushing out half naked as she was had flung her arms around his neck and buried her face in his bosom ere he was able cither to meet or to reject the proffered embrace she drew herself back gazed upon his face through visible tears and then again folded herself round him  oh adam1 said she  god has heard my prayer jod has not deserted mebut now i was alonenow i have vou with me and i shall fear nothing  she uttered a short

blairs hand ard withdrew him from the window she reseated him by the table poured another glass of wine and again forcing him to swallow it began to tell him in broken syllables the story of her

some minutes as if unable to believe her eyes and at last seeing mair toss his arni aloft and turn himself on thc couch she withdrew hastily and the massy door swung after her with a heavy slap when she quitted the guilty chamber blair hears a churchbell turns magdalen and leaving charlotte in a doze goes out upon the hills he sits down by a pool like wordsworths leechgatherer only with infinitely less to do he becomes bewildered and is in the very act of once more taking the water when he is again prevented by charlotte who seems really to be a sort of walking corkjacket to him she speaks  stop rash man  what dost dum  avilt thou slay thyself iiook back faint heart look hack on me  art thou alone miserable   blair turned round and met her wild eyes lost woman said he shaking

the idle readers of the day pronounce to be matchless for its morality and its pathos  we have given a very faithful abstract of its follies its impieties and its cant and we cannot dismiss the volume without seriously and earnestly protesting against this parody on feeling  this mockery of pathos  this mad and wicked brawl of intemperate and unnatural passion wc know not what real and pure interest can be excited by this filthy betrayal of vice in characters and in situations to which we are accustomed to look for the decencies the virtues and the white enjoyments of life for what worthy end religion is thus to be stained and insulted we cannot conjecture and we should be very glad if those persons who laud it would communicate to us the causes of their eulogies is it absolutely necessary that crime should be prepared as a dram for the world that women should be wives before their seduction and that the adulterers the lovelacesshould be in holy orders that a man should woo a woman at the tomb of his dead wife  and that prayer and religion should be made the panders to immorality having shown the book iii its true colours and spoken strongly of it as we feelwe

  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering has secretly loved her but he has exchanged into a regiment going to india to put himself out of the reach of temptation georgie has a cousin ida who is engaged to be married to another of the four friendsthe rev geoffrey luttrell an honest frank simplehearted sporting clergyman much more orthodox on points of shooting and salmonfishing than on divinity ida is a thoroughlywicked woman and the demon of the story she is madly in love with dering georgie has a narrow escape from the pranks of a vicious horse which she has wilfully insisted on mounting maurice dering saves her there is a capital description of the  race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief there is a certain gerald annesley a handsome blackguard who has known georgie in former times and who has stirred the first romantic feelings of her heart he renewb acquaintance with her and ida sets herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lovely face the lovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or

fiction the winged victory by sarah grand heinemann os net at any rate sarah grand has not sought as have some other novelists to put readers off with inferior matter in this time of all times her novel besides being what all fiction should beentertaining and recreativecontains much thought fitting for consideration today in fact we may credit her not only with having fulfilled the purpose of a novel but also with having produced at the same time a novel with a purpose to say that she had accomplished both things satisfactorily would be to number the book among the classics and that we cannot do for after gladly bestowing so much of appreciation we must unburden ourselves of our main criticism and then proceed to the consideration of her work in some detail her novel will accomplish its purpose we believe in widening the outlook of the average novelreader but to our mind in addition to other faults she has omitted the pith of the matter had she more plainly analysed the nature of the soil from which the roots of the tragedy drew their nourishment it would have been more helpful as she makes one of her characters say  causes are the things to attack not effects she does in fact inform us that the feet of her wingless victory were clay in so far as her motive power was largely the spirit of revenge on those who were responsible for the sufferings of the poor she had the intellect which  kims the surface it is reserved for the spirit whose advances she had slighted to plumb the depths she had taken her fate into her own hands when she preferred intellectual ascendancy to spiritual enlightenment but the whole setting is in a clay soil impervious to light and air the matter of the girls birth is wrapped in secrecy no less foolish than is usual in such cases the secrecy was as much a matter of the conventions as was the luxury with which even the authors best characters surrounded themselves while bemoaning the lot of the poor in not having more of the worlds goods forgetting at the same time how uneconomically they indulged themselves in superabundance the authors 4 big  man closes a sumptuous repast with what would have been blasphemous prayer had he been really big enough to understand the most elementary economy the income which he spent on himself must have been many times more than the average one of 222 for a man and his wife and three children we have no wish to be thought extremists to allow him but the average income would probably have quenched entirely his utility it is the authors blindness to the awful responsibility of her hero that we deplore the authors conception of the world is obviously that of a place where the intolerableness of conditions must be mitigated with the object of its becoming as efficient a school as possible for fitting its pupils for a heaven hereafter and else where in other words the author does not consider that the ideal of heaven on earth is ever likely to come within the range of practical politics the fact that we do not agree with her detracts not a whit from the value o4 the work considered from the authors own point of view and so from that point we will consider it the heroine possesses as did adnam the hero of 4 adnams orchard to which the book is the sequel in a literal sense if not in that usual in fictionan overabundance of excellence which however it is not very hard to credit her with though some of her qualities are difficult of acceptance in the light of her lowly origin in 4 adnams orchard  we had much dissertation on the land here the heroine ella banks who will be remembered as a lacemaker in the former book continues her calling though in very different circumstances the book opens with her being met by the duke of castlefield sayes solicitor who drives her straightway to the west end mansion which has been placed at her disposal society with the capital sthe sign manual of all that is sinfulis induced by the patronage of royalty to frequent her lace exhibition with the inevitable consequence that the protegee receives many unwelcome attentionsthe outcome of one of which involves her in homicide meanwhile she awaits the return of her lover the dukes son her marriage with whom she looks upon as the copingstone of the design by which she will accomplish her object of freeing the lace trade from the sweating conditions imposed on it by the profiteering middlemen meanwhile the duke lavishes wealth and caresses on her and pajrs her clandestine visits late at nightuntil at last the heroine awakens to the fact that scandal is busy with her name at once she believes that there is truth in the rumour which assigns discreditable motives to the dukes attentions in consequence she consents to marry the son without the fathers knowledge and immediately after is made aware that she is the dukes lovechild how the knot is cut we prefer to leave the reader to find out lest this which is to our mind a greater improbability than many which have preceded it should deter any one from the perusal of what after all is a novel far better worth reading than many based upon more likely happenings having very briefly outlined the plot we must allude to some of the admirable characterization there are delineations of the good and bad sides of society which are worthy to be mentioned along with the great names of thackeray and meredith the old lordly reprobate and his parasitic tailors model are two instances and not far behind these are the galaxy of coarseminded women on the other hand we have the princess who betrays her teutonic blood to a degree which will hardly be acceptable today but she is nevertheless a true and lovable presentment the touches with which character are delineated are excellent throughout but we can refer only to a few there ia the solicitorwho was so obviously a man who did not receive orders but was instructedwith his twitching nose reminiscent of a rabbit lady ami an epitome of her caste in all time she felt secure in the established order of good and evil considered that if there were people not equally wellsatisfied with things as they are those people were in the wrong and must be brought to heel and viewing the process from the height of a position whence unpleasant details were not visible to the naked eye she indignantly set aside as impertinent any difference of opinion on the subject that might reach her and was not tobe warned  then the duke her husband he might with justice have called himself a busy man and such business as his has its own importance many lives would have been disarranged and much inconvenience entailed had he neglected it but it was the business of a system of a great machine which ho had not set in motion and could not control it controlled him he was the tool of a machine which was working with results that he knew to be bad in many ways in great measure an ineffectual machine into the defective parts of which he meant to look but never did to any purpose besides his part in the working of the machine was obligatory and obligatory work is not soulsatisfying as an object in life peculiar to himself would have been how he found his real object in life we shall leave readers to discover for themselves some of the traits depicted are easily fitted to people well known a few years ago  but if they have been lifted from life they have been so mixed up as to render them void of any offence occasionally the characters appear to have got out of hand and we like them better freed of the authors control but they appear later to be ruthlessly subjugated to conform with the exigencies of the plot in an age when there is so much more writing and talking than thinking the novel strikes us as overlong towards the end and yet one cannot suggest any of the 650 pages which can safely be skipped,juvenile_contra

stories from the bible the first impression is what good value for money is this stout and well printed volume and by such an author  the next feeling is one of uneasy apprehension how  stories from the bible  the book is obviously not an anthology of extracts has mr de la mare been bold enough to rewrite the prose which is inwoven with the memories of childish years for so many of us  one opens the volume at random at the story of the plagues of egypt and starts reading a paragraph so it continued for seven days and when the seven days were at an end moses came again into the presence of pharaoh is ones fear allayed by that  or this for now the river not only continued to flow bloodred but the fish in it perished or this  the river stank and not the river alone   partly the prejudiced inclination for the already familiar has made us ready to be irritated on any provocation but still there is something not quite right about such things as these it seems somehow neither the bible nor the walter de la mare whose prose we admire so wonderingly we turn to the pleasant  introduction and find quickly that no man can be more convinced of the dangers that beset his task than the author himself for he says  ords in their influence are subtle and delicate beyond all things known to man and the least change in them when the are in company or the least addition to that company cannot but entail a change of meaning a change that is in their complete effect on the mind and spirit of the reader then to illustrate this truth mr de la mlare quotes parallel passages in the book of ruth from different versions the  wycliffe  i382 the  wycliffe  revised by john purvey 1386 the miles coverdale version 1536 the geneva bible 1560 the douai bible 16o9 the authorised version 161 i it is a most instructive lesson and just the kind which would leave a treasure in the mind for ever and there comes the reflection how happy a mortal is that child who discovers the  story  of c come hither  for himself and then reads what mr nahums grownup disciple has done in these renderings of old testament stories made  to put that remembrance of what the bible meant to him as a child  as completely as i can into words for doubts and fears depart with a straightforward reading it is no compliment to mr de la mare to pretend against ones better judgement that there are no flaws at all in the prose anywhere no flaws that is of a kind avoidable by such a writer as mr de la mare there are a few uneasy and inept touches when perhaps the wish to enliven the manner was not accompanied by his generally exquisite sense of rhythm and style but as a whole these renderings show that literary style and the simple beauty which should be but is too rarely made the test of suitability for childrens reading are not incompatible but necessary one to the other that alone is a triumph it is to be expected that in recording his imaginative experience of the old stories mr de la mare should sometimes abandon the bald directness of the bible narrative e  stories from the bible by walter de la mare 7s 6d faber  faber and though the change involves often a real sacrifice it is not difficult to be reconciled to the new beauty of detail introduced such detail and such atmosphere must surely give to a young reader visions which the old narrative alone could not even the sophisticated reader will find himself constantly thanking the author for enriched understanding fresh perceptions this is especially true where the setting allows scope for the characteristic prose of mr de la mare to say that the reader of  the riddle and other stories  will not be disappointed with this book is perhaps the aptest praise possible but this is to speak of the mere writing which if it is less free from the  defects and shortcomings  referred to by the author in his introduction is nevertheless the fruit of a task far more difficult accomplished as perhaps no other living english writer could have accomplished it consider the field covered by this volume divided into nine main sections headed  the garden of eden   the flood joseph   moses  the wilderness  samson samuel   saul david think of the dreadful pitfalls awaiting anybody who would rewrite the bible stories under these headings  is it not then a triumph to have enriched future generations of readers with so little offence to the most unprepared and irritable  there are uninteresting irrelevances and ugly barbarities in the old testament a child may come to such a book as this losing hardly anything of worth except an occasional marvel of directness but gaining contact with the ancient word and also with the rare mind of a poet writing in his own language r l megroz,juvenile

  xak wiam me ferdwnr jerk by charles b taylor i ma author of  records of a good nantes life c chapma and ha with much grace and vigour of conception and with great sweetness of imaginative sentiment this little work fails to produce in the reader that tranquil or elevated mood of mind which is the result of a true work of art this is owing to the attempt to make it at once an imaginative presentation and a didactic asay the fictitious narrative an the moral essay cannot be run in one they are incompatible the incidents have no effect by being kept in subordination to an opinion which is to be impressed and people will not understand the moral to be proved by them because their imaginary character is continually obtruding itself poor sambos advice  when you preachee preachee and when you floggee floggee may be paradied for the use of didactic novelists the story and the moral had better be served up on different plates as somebody recommended with reference to the butter and the hairs in it at a slovenly inn imaginative literature can only promote moral culture indirectly by the tastes and habitual temper which converace with it encourages the felicity however with which many of the characters in this book are drawn and siipported justifies the belief that the author if he would confine himself to legitimate novel writing and keep his moral precepts for his sermons would be eminently successful in the portraiture of domestic life,juvenile
  litth women or meg jo beth and amy part second by louisa m alcott low  co tms is a cheerful domestic story which appears to be written for the especial use and behoof of the fair sex as it deals with the gradual development of character which takes place in the four young heroines whose earlier years have been described in a previous work the scene is in the united states and our fair countrywomen will find here portrayed a state of society to which they are utterly unaccustomed although at the same time the book abounds with touches of human nature and traits of character which are common to all the world probably but we speak on such topics with diffidence there is something very lifelike in miss jos confession some time after refusing an offer of marriage that perhaps if teddy had tried again she might have said  yesnot because she loved him any more but because she cared more to be loved than when he went away but teddy has now found elsewhere the haven of rest which jo denied him and jo has to content herself with the gift of an awakened but as yet unsatisfied heart it is almost needless to say that miss jo is one of the strongminded race of young women and that she has started in life with the fallacious idea that a mans love is by no means essential to a womans happiness now she has found out her mistake and deigns to make confession to her mother who congratulates her on her progress in natural feelings tm glad of that jo says the calm but sympathising parent for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward jo takes the advice very kindly but assures her mother that her heart has become so elastic lately that it cannot be properly filled as of yore with family affections i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it says poor jo i do says her mother with a meaning smile this seems all very pretty and sensible and it is a fact we believe that young ladies do sometimes get confidential with their mammas on these subjects when softened by a little disappointment miss jo in her early days aspires to literary success the other sisters one artistic one consumptive and so on follow out their several destinies and most of them get  settled  in due time though not so to speak according to the  first intention there is a good deal of innocent fun in the book and there is no lack of quaint transatlantic expressions and turns of thought she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it you must promise not to cut up any pranksdont be a peacock i only moaned a trifle just to keep the other girls company  i dont wish to get raspy so lets change the subject no wonder that young mr lawrence the hero gives up all thought of jo the individual who doesnt wish to  get raspy and seeks happiness with the gentle amy who vows that she is prouder of her handsome husband than of all his money and addresses him with the tender words  dont laughbut your nose is such a comfort to me  the reader will find more truth and more humour in this story than in many works of fiction of a more pretentious character,juvenile

three months under the snow i tnis is one of those delightful books which young readers will peruse with all the interest of robinson crusoe and which many old folks too will etoy with equal pleasure we heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents during seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of switzerland known as the jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers but during the other five months from may until october the scene changes then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass allured by the latter attraction the swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of jura on these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies the scene of the narrative of  three months under the snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the jura one of these i shepherds frangoisthe father of pierre lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and pierre accompanied by louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent in the course of ascent up the mountain pierre has the  thee ontihe under the snow the journal of a yon inhabitant of the jun tranuated fro the french of oldpomowha rigiu tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot no particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to i be the pivot on which the whole plot turns on arriving at the pasture ground pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure the whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home the father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings the father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm franjois before he reaches the village meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment i called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   poor blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  the wind roared violently it rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chalet would have been carried away i lifted my head several times fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults the shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind he then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable when the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings she seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us how greedily she ate the handful of salt that i gave her her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain she gave us a good pailful of milk such is our introduction to blanchette before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison on the regularity indeed with which she yields her milk the lives of the prisoners are found in a great measure to depend up to this time although the wind iwa been roaring around the mountain cottage there had been nothing to indicate that positive danger had set in on the following morning however when i i pierre awoke he was surprised to find himself in complete darkness at first he thought that his sleep had left him at an earlier hour than usual  grandfather he cried  you are up before daylight  my dear boy replied the old man  if we were to wait the light of day we should remain long enough in bed i fear the snow is above thewindow the terrible truth at last flashed on the mind they were entombed in the snow which had fallen thickly and heavily during the night they knew too from experience that there was little or no prospect of obtaining relief until the spring returned it is at this point that the peculiar value of the book as teaching presence of mind in danger and cheerful confidence in providence appears the old man who is pious takes a hopeful view of things and like mariners on a raft after the wreck of their vessel the little party begins to scrutinise the stores that are left to enable them to accomplish their arctic voyage pierre seeing that a glimmering of the sun appears down the chimney through a part which the snow has not choked up manages to emerge to the roof of the chalet  i but as nothing but bleak desolation meets his gaze he speedily comes down again a fire is lighted but in the midst of their confusion the little hut itself gets nearly burned down by the kindling of  some straw still their hearts do not fail to guard against similar emergencies they fill a tub with snow and place it beside the fireplace ready to extinguish any future conflagration their situation too is not found so cheerless as might have been imagined happily their wooden clock keeps correct time so that they do not lose their reckoning there is plenty of hay also for blanchette on whose life theirs now depend a limited stock of potatoes is also discovered while a bottle or two of swiss wine and some three loaves of hard mountain bread with a few other trifles turn up pierre likewise in the course of his researches finds an axe some straw to plait into hats and what proves a greater treasure still an old work of devotion which supplies them with admirable counsel in their difficulties leading them to earnest prayer to god for his protection and for the improvement of the trials which he has sent to them blanchette moreover is brought from the stable to the hut and proves pleasant company for them a month or more passes in this was pierre takes another journey to the roof and watching carefully the mode in which the snow lies conceives it possible to digg away some of the superincumbent portions of it so as to open the door and admit light to the window the brave and noble boy at the risk of much inconvenience and peril accomplishes his obect and once more the light of day refracted from piles of glittering snow and ice breaks in upon them they have not time however to enjoy this very much before another snowstorm sets in blocking the cottage doors and windows and covering the roof with a heavier load than before the old mans piety comes again to his aid and he encourages his nephew not to despond but to believe that this disappointment is ordered b7 providence for wise purposesa conclusion which is proved by the event but we must take the narration of this incident from the work itself december 13thwe had a dreadful alarm yesterday today even i can scarcely collect my thoughts enough to write down what has passed alas we are not yet sure that we have escaped all danger i was busy milking the goat while my grandfather was lighting the fire suddenly she pricked up her ears as if she heard some extraordinary noise and began to tremble all over swhat is the matter poor blanchette  i said caressing her but immediately we heard the most dreadful howlings as if it were over our heads  wolves i exclaimed silence my boy caress blanehette said my grandfather and he approached her himself and gave her some salt she continued to tremble and the howlings continued also well louis said he in a low voice  what would have become of us had you opened a passage to the window who knows if even the chimney might not have afforded a passage to those ravenous beasts   and do you think we are safe even as we are p i  i hope sobut speak low and do not cease to caress blanchetteher bleating might betray us one would have thought that she had the same fears for she did not make the slighitest noise my grandfather came and sat down by me i held the goat in my arms he had his hand laid upon my shoulder and i needed all the encouragement of his calm and serene countenance to keep me from shrieking aloud with fright au that i had previously experienced in the chalet could not be compared to the agony of yesterday throughout the whole day we passed it by the side of blanchette and at several intervals we heard the howlings of the wolves at one time it was so loud that i thought my last hour was come they are digging through the snow i cried clasping my grandfather in my arms they will i get in and devour us  the grandfather calms him however and the danger passes away the wolves it is conjectured had not scented the rich prize below but had brought the carcass of some animal and made the outcry which alarmed the inmates of the cottage by their quarling as they devoured their prey as the winter advanced a more serious trouble arose to daunt the heart of poor pierre for his grandfather unable to stand the severe cold gradually drooped and finally died what followed is well calculated to teach young people the value of calmness selfpossession and moral courage most boys under similar circumstances would have been iin danger of losing their reason but pierre encouraged by the excellent advice which his grandfather had given him before his death bears up even under his new trial the scene in which he is represented as digging a grave for his grandfather and interring him is not only admirably painted but divested of all repulsive features our youang hero was now lft alonea solitary hermit on the top of the jurawith nothing but his goat blanchette to keep him company and iyet he was not quit alone either for as mungo p ark was cheered in the african desert by seeing a flower so pierre was reminded of the omnipresence of the great creator by another equally striking incident a piece of rubbish had fallen down his chimney the noise attracted his attention and as apprehensive of the soot having taken fire he looked up an iron tube which sewved as an escape for the smoke a star passed over its orifice crossing it slowly at its greatest breadth the appearance lasted but a moment yet it affected pierre greatly reminding him that even in his forlorn condition apparently forgotten by every human being there was one to whom he could make known by prayer his wants and difficulties he had indeed poor fellow need of all the comfort he could get for one morning he heard around him what sounded like the final cruh of naturethe ceiling cracked pieces of plaster fell and a portion of the wall of the cottage lost its perpendicular after the uproar had ceased he began to fear that an avalanche had fallen in his neighbourhood covering for aught he knew the chalet with its fragments however the shock roused him from a state of dejection to face a new and perhaps more perplexing difficulty blanchette the goat began to cease giving her milka dreadful discovery for it threatens to reduce him to the cruel alternative of starvation or of killing the poor animal which has cheered by its company his solitary hours from day to day the condition of blanchette is recorded in pierres diary and we read with deep interest the accounts which show the allimportant milk to be continually diminishing  january 27the milk decreases and the goat fattens in proportion  february 2she has given even less milk than the day before and i have gained nothing but the pain of hearing her bleat most sorrowfully for more than half the day  february 8i will own my weakness i shed tears today when i made a last vain attempt to milk blanchette when she saw me stoop she gave me a look of defiance as if she were standing on her guard against any further attempt i threw away my pail i sat down near the poor beast embraced her and wept bitterly what is the poor fellow to do now  it breaks his heart to think of killing the affectionate animal ah happily his trials are well nigh over on the 24th of february he lighted his fire scarcely had he done so when the smoke began to ascend and he heard a great noise without at first he thought it was the wolves which had returned but human voices are heard hailing him quicker and quicker come the strokes of the pickaxe and

kaffir folklore or a selection from the traditional tales current among the people living on the eastern border of the cape colony by george mccall theal son nenschein  co the stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,juvenile

were out in the fortyfive that is participating in the rebellion of 145 the father of the scottish orphans was executed at carlisle as a rebel  his wife sunk under the grief of her situation and died a few days before the execution of her husband  the three orphans who had been imprisoned with tilt ir parents were rescued by an old domestic of the family who brought tlieuiupinsecresy until the eldest having obtained the patronage of a gentleman who had come to live in the neighbourhood procured a commission in the army andbut we know no more for here the tale abruptly terminates waiting till the fair author has leisure to furnish a second part of the history for the consolation however of such as mav feel uneasy respecting the fate of the orphans mrs blackford kindly assures us of

taming a very pleasing narrative and iiculeatinijf the best of moral duties he shall make one extract relating to the rescuing the orphans from prison by the servant william mathieson   the moment william thought he could speak without being heard he informed mr monteith heiad learned that an order for his removal had been given and that in two days he feared he would lie taken from stirling on his way to england to be tried af carlisle  that he had discovered that colonel monteith had had interest enough to be allowed to detain the children under the pretence of taking care of them and that strict orders had been given to the governor of the castle not to salier them or mrs monleitli to cpiit the prison till after his reuval  but my dear good master continued william seeing mr monteith

risking and you may depend on finding me ready at the hour you have mimed to attempt to put the plan in execution  william endeavoured to persuade his master to attempt his own deliverance but mr monteith felt convinced that instant death must be the consequence if he did so and the fear of adding to his poor xvi fes sufferings by making her a witness to such a dreadful catastrophe weighed against all the arguments his faithful servant could urge and when the jailor summoned wiliam from the presence of his master he xva fenced to leave the prison without having the slightest hope of

began to prepare the children though the agony she endured both from parting xvith them for the lirt time in her life aud from the danger he could not help seeing they ran in eae of any unforeseen

because they are already old friends and because of the simple beautiful style of their telling this edition of the  parables  is a most desirable volume to possess it is handsome tasteful and generously illustrated miss woodward has evidently found herself quite in sympathy with her subjects  and her frontispiece illustrating what is perhaps the best known of all the  parables  a lesson of faithgives the keynote to the whole it is original natural simple and without violating the limitations of bird and insect life gives just the right suggestion of thought and speech in that life as a giftbook for children this collection of stories is perennially suitable for not only does it captivate the childmind by its intimacy with the animal and vegetable world but the nature lessons being always accurate thiey inform withouit tears so to speak and the happy child learns scientific facts while drinking in romance  iparables from nature by margaret gatty illustrated by alice woodward g bell and sons 5s net this new edition of mrs gattys wellknown parables has some charming illustrations and is prefaced by a brief note or biography of the writer margaret scott the daughter of dr scott who had been foreign secretary to nelson and his chaplain on board the victory was born in 1809 after the battle of trafalgar dr scott became vicar of southminster and of catterick where margaret and her sister led a life of cultivated leisure such as does not seem possible to those of this generation who rush along through existence in the present hurry of the world the girl became a good french and italian scholar but her strong taste for natural history did not develop until much later in life when during a stay at hastings in 1848 she began to take an interest in seaweeds and zoophytes her  history of british seaweeds came out in 1862 there is little to record in her serene and uneventful lifemrs gatty never went beyond the united kingdombut her marriage to the rev alfred gatty vicar of ecclesfield and her death in 1873 her parables have survived the test of time and are remarkable for a certain sobriety a freshness of humour and for an unaffectedness rare in the style of literature to which they belong her knowledge of birds and beasts was minute and conscientious she cculd neve acquiesce in making scientific statements without ascertaining their accuracy and  when writing her  parables she was aided in verifying her facts by two scientific friends this truthfulness of her presentment of nature has much to do with the enduring vitality of her work its permanent charm to more than one generation  parables from nature by margaret gatty with notes on the natural history and illustrations by w holman hunt and others new and complete edition with memoir of the author by her daughter juliana horatia ewing g bell  sons mrs gattys parables from nature have so high and permanent a place among childrens classics that a standard edition of them has become desirable with this we are furnished in the handsome volumo before us wherein the interpretation of the parables is rendered easy by means of instructive annotations  and the charms of the authors fancy are increased by the artists responsive skill nothing that we can say is wanted to procure a welcome for mrs gatty in every home where there are children or those who sympathise with children but her many admirers will be grateful to mrs ewing for having in the present edition of her mothers bestknown work given them svh particulars of the authors life as wili bie them to ralise the scenes and circumstances which fed her fertile fancy and bent it in that direction where she achieved so much success margaret gatty waa the younger of the two daughters of dr scott lord nelsons chaplain and inherited both from her father and mother a love of learning and a power of turning it to account left motherless in her infancy she grew up within the quiet walls of a yorkshire parsonage books were her chief companions and from these as well as from constant intercourse with men of culture her education was derived it does not seem that she underwent any systematic course of training but her innate love of study and the abundant materials around her supplied her with all that she needed that her time was well employed is obvious from the facts that she attained considerable proficiency in art before her childhood was over and that when she was seventeen she began to translate dantes inferno into english verse and to illustrate each canto with appropriate designs in 1839 she married the rev alfred gatty dd vicar of ecclesfield where the remainder and most productive period of her life was spent her marriage says her daughter  like that of her parents was founded upon congeniality of aims and pursuits and her work met only with additional help and encouragement in her new home her first book entitled the fairy godmothers was published in 1851 and four years afterwardsthe first series of parables from nature with illustrations by the author herself appeared it is interesting to trace the origin of this mrs gattys most characteristic work she had been much struck with the beauty of adamss allegories and especially with that of  the old mans home and the kings messengers  but she was very much distressed that the mosses and green lizards should have been made emblems of sin in the story of  the distant hills and thought it a very undesirable association of ideas for the minds of children the subject awakened in her mind the memory of quarless emblems which had been her delight in childhood and prompted her to her first essay in morai teaching through natural objects with these her acquaintance was something more than superficial as the notes to the present edition abundantly show her powers of imagination and extensive range of reading enabled her to carry on with much success the plan she had adopted and five volumes of parables appeared between 1855 and 1870 on these her reputation is mainly based but we should not be doing justice to her industry and enterprise if we omitted to mention that within the same period she published numerous volumes of tales and a scientific treatise on british seaweeds and also started upon its successful course the admirable serial known to all children as aunt judys magazine mrs gatty died on october 4 1873 working almost to the end in spite of the disease which during the last ten years had invaded limb after limb and function after function until the intellect alone remained unimpaired her daughters criticism upon her writing is one in which most readers will concur and if we cannot call mrs gatty a genius we may readily allow that her sincerity commonsense and unaffected love of goodness render her a far better companion for children than many an author to whom that terra has been applied her tales are uniformly wholesome as well as attractive and it is in our opinion no slight recommendation that  not one of them depends for its pathos upon early deathbeds or unavailing regrets i charles j robinson f,juvenile

the eskdale herdboy a scottish talc by mrs blackford vjmo pp 210 a good deal of exertion has been turned within these late years to thc instruction of the lower orders in their accidence and spelling books have been let forth upon them in a torrent of very praiseworthy liberality this was certainly some progress in raising that immense majority of our species who have not drawn hereditary estates or solid prizes in the great lottery of life into a hope of enjoyment rather above the cattle with whom they have hitherto lived in such meek equality and the effort wa9 perhaps as much as could fairly be expected from the lazy and london luxury that knows nothing of the peasant but as a remote feeder of pigs and poultry and nothing of the distresses of rural life but by the increased agio on blanched asparagus and premature peas but there are other observers andcabins have been penetrated by the feet of the fashionable and the fair some share of this has been due to thc romance that dreams of arcadia at the sight of a thatched roof and finds a delighted refuge for flutter ing sentimentality in peat smoke iud mud walls  but some share may nm all our scepticism about benevolence

stood on the beautiful hanks of thc river esk in dumfriesshire one of the most southern countries in scotland a small cottage thc neat white walls ttcllthatched roof and clean casementwindows ornamented as they were with honeysuckles and roses attracteirthc admiration of the few strangers who from the uncommon beauty and grandeur of thc scenery were tempted to turn off the direct road from langholm to edinburgh and follow the windings of the river to its source the cottages in general in that part of the country present a very different appearance  having too frequently a look of neglect the windows broken the walls dirty and instead of a pretty garden a heap of mud before the door the contrast therefore rendered this build  ing thc more remarkable and led people to suppose what indeed was the case that its inhabitants were more industrious and had seen a little more of the customs of other countries than their less neat and cleanly neighbours the names of the couple who resided on this snot were john and marion telfer their history i am now going to relate john was the only son of an honest industrious couple who lived in the neighbourhood of langholm but who unfortunately both died of a fever when he was little more than ten years old leaving him nothing but their blessing and thc virtuous habits of integrity and obedience in which they had trained him from his earliest youth on their deathbed they entreated that the excellent clergyman who in spite of the malignity of the disease continued to comfort and pray by them in their last moments would take compassion on their poor kttle orphan and find him employment among the neighbouring formers either as a herdhoy to some of the numerous flocks of sheep which arc common in eskdale or a ploughboy in their fields mr martin for such was thc name of the pious pastor assured them that he would do all in his power for their chikl and lie kept his word for as soon as they were dead he took thc boy home to hil own house and there endeavoured by kindness and sympathy to console him forhjs great and irreparable loss for some days ail ins endeavours were unsuccessful john though sensible of the kind attentions of mr murtin still felt miserable and unhappy all his dear mothers care and tenderness all thc pains and trouble that his kind father used to take in teaching him to read his bible after perhaps a hard days work thc delight with which they both watched his improvementall all rose to poor johns mind aud made him believe he newer more could be happy mr martin at last seeing the boys melancholy continue thought that a little employment might serve to rouse him he therefore one morning called john into hi study and asked him if he would be so good as to assist in dusting anel arranging some books which mere in a large chest in the  corner ofthe room john from lowness of spirits did not much like to bc employed  but as he had been taught by his father always to be obedient

represented at last he came to the one where man friday is saved from the savages here his curiosity got the better of the natural awe he felt for air martin  and he cried out  pray sir lie so good as to tell me what this meansfor though john had been taught to read his bible as well as his poor father was capable of teaching yet this was in so imperfect a way that he could by no means read easily and was obliged to spell more than half his words mr martin smiled goodnaturedly as johns exclamation made him raise his head from the book he was reading and desiring him to come near his chair he explained at some length what the print represented after which he asked john if he would not like to be able to read the story himself jolm immediately answered o dear yes sir that i should  but looking down and the tears starting into his eyes  that can never be now  for my dear father is dead and gone and nobody else will ever take thc trouble to teach so poor a boy jw i am anti yet continued he looking in mr martins face and brightening a little with a kind of hope  dont you think sir that if i succeed in getting a place and if i am very very attentive and alway taite pains to please my master i may in time be able to save out of my wage as much as a penny u week  for i know if i could do that i might so to the school at langholm 1 remember nearing my poor dear father wsh very much that he could afford to pay so much money forme as he said he waa sure that mr campbell would teach me to read much beater than he could the history proceeds through the innocent details of life such as it might bc found in a valley in the primitive age the young peasant grows up la understanding and morals and the ministers family is the place of tranquil virtue but there conies a disturbance to all this quiet in the conduct of a son the minister has hot had the power of communicating his own spirit to his turbulent boy and brother william runs off to sea leaving helen in sorrow the effects of this disobedience tire however most injurious to hil parents his mother overwhelmed with sorrow takes to her bed the scene that follows is pictured with great artlessness and we think with peculiar feeling letters arrive from william mentioning his having fixed himself on board a ship going to sea helen folded up the letters and sat for a few minutes considering on their content her own good sense and feelings of obedience to her parents pointed out to her in how very improper a style her brother wrote  but her love and affection for winiam made her try to excuse him  boys are so different from girls thought she  william hat been away so much too from home and besides he must chase a profession and rt would be hard not to leave him at liberty to be what he thinks himself flt for in the evening of this doy mrs martin felt herself better and for thc first time since her illness spoke to her husband on the subject of william mr martin told her he was with her brother and likewise that he had heard from himself he thea stated what captain elliott had said as to williams being allowed to remain with him but owned he was very averse to this pian mrs martin answered very calmly  my dear husband as fur as my judgement goes i perfectly agree with my brother i would not certainly have chosen that william should be a sailorif i could have prevented it hut as he has acted i think it is thc best thing we can now do he will be under my dear brothers care  and i shall now  controlled she looking at her husband with tendcitwsa  die in peace on hw account convinced fhat elliott will exert every means to correct and improve my poor boy thc last legacy of dying sister mr martin quite alarmed by this address asked lier if she felt herself worse and rose to send for mr armstrong she krid her hand gently on his arm  my dearest love said she  i am not woree bm i own i have been watching for an opportunity of preparing your mtnd for what i believe myseltto be inrvitablc i do not suv i shall die immediately  yet i am convince my constitution is ao tdibjuered tliut a very short time will no t be allowed me to prepare for my uwful change i have

to you with regard to helen at present i must have don my strength will not permit nie to continic the conversation only write my dearest love to my brother and tell hiin i consign my son entirely to his management  and i trust he will endeavour to guard his father from all future anxiety on his account he has cost him epiite enough already the last words were spoken so low that they were evidently not meant for her husbands ear isle had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking when she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer a few days showed plainly that mrs martin knew her own situation but too well she appeared gradually though slowly sinking one evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  i shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed she then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to william anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before it may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then mr martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her one evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health he therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish i will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer leave me for a few minutes you may trust me i will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father mr martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife in half an hour helen and her father were at mrs martins bedside she smiled faintly when she perceived them holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband my dear i wish much to see my mother pray write for her she will i inn sure gratify me mr martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to melrose mrs martin then took hold of helens hand and said  my clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me the length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of mrs m to her excellent daughter it thus concludes helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed when she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing she then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air she obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors mrs ms mother mrs elliott arrived the next day when mrs martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt melrose ind come to live at the manse mr martin assured her that she should ever be considered by him os his own mother his wife joined their hands exclaiming my work is finished in this world i have now only to look forward to another and a better her work in this world did indeed seem finished the next day without any apparent change for the worse as her mother and helen were sitting by thc bedside and her kind anxious husband was supporting her in his arms she laid her head on his shoulder and seemed to fall asleep it was some minutes before he was aware that she was gone for ever thus perished one of the best and most exemplary of mothers entirely from anxious

the eskdale herdboy a scottish talc by mrs blackford vjmo pp 210 a good deal of exertion has been turned within these late years to thc instruction of the lower orders in their accidence and spelling books have been let forth upon them in a torrent of very praiseworthy liberality this was certainly some progress in raising that immense majority of our species who have not drawn hereditary estates or solid prizes in the great lottery of life into a hope of enjoyment rather above the cattle with whom they have hitherto lived in such meek equality and the effort wa9 perhaps as much as could fairly be expected from the lazy and london luxury that knows nothing of the peasant but as a remote feeder of pigs and poultry and nothing of the distresses of rural life but by the increased agio on blanched asparagus and premature peas but there are other observers andcabins have been penetrated by the feet of the fashionable and the fair some share of this has been due to thc romance that dreams of arcadia at the sight of a thatched roof and finds a delighted refuge for flutter ing sentimentality in peat smoke iud mud walls  but some share may nm all our scepticism about benevolence attributed to the genuine desire ol making thc comfortless comfortable and giving the ignorant the common means of knowing their duty to society the writer of this book has been one of the latter investigators anti we are gretilled by giving such publicity as may be within our power to a work calculated tc conduct to wisdom through pleasantness the herd boy of eskdale is thc history of an orphan who by the common accidents of rustic life and the easy exercise of rustic virtues makes his way through the world not indeed to title and estate the absurd lures of viiluge ambition but to competence tocharactcr to thc possession of the woman of his carly fondness and to perhh thc still higher reward the mer of giving his carly benefactors child a shelter under his roof anti repaying iib debt of gratitude to the sleeper in the grave hy invaluable kindness to the dejected being that he hail left behind to the struggles of the world the writer opens her design in a brief preface the author of this work many vcars ago spent a few weeks in kskdale the beauly of the country made a deep impression on her perhaps the more so from its being the farthest excursion to the southward that she bael then made from her native home the general character and manners of the inhabitants are she believes correctly represented for there is scarcely an incident exemplifying these of which she had not known the coiuiterpart in real life the respect universally paid by the parishioners to their clergyman mid the great influence which he possesses in forming their minds and morals are circumstances which have fallen under her own observation she hts felt a peculiar satisfaction in describing the simple und useful life of mr and mrs martin from thc remembrance of many worthy cjipls h hniltr situations sh ha ea deavoured in relating the adventures of john telfer thc herdboy to impress on the minds of her young readers the permanent advantages ot early integrity and gratitude in thc short and unfortunate life ot william martin she has attempted to show thc duty of subduing a disobedient and selfwilled temper the character of helen is meant on thc contrary to illustrate thc inestimable value of which a dutiful daughter may be her prudence steadiness and even energy on some trying occasions are the result of an education conducted on those principle which ensure the love of the child by a reliance on the justice and affection of the parent in short this is an excellent mothers book we give some extracts the narrative begins in this simple manner in the year 1807 there stood on the beautiful hanks of thc river esk in dumfriesshire one of the most southern countries in scotland a small cottage thc neat white walls ttcllthatched roof and clean casementwindows ornamented as they were with honeysuckles and roses attracteirthc admiration of the few strangers who from the uncommon beauty and grandeur of thc scenery were tempted to turn off the direct road from langholm to edinburgh and follow the windings of the river to its source the cottages in general in that part of the country present a very different appearance  having too frequently a look of neglect the windows broken the walls dirty and instead of a pretty garden a heap of mud before the door the contrast therefore rendered this build  ing thc more remarkable and led people to suppose what indeed was the case that its inhabitants were more industrious and had seen a little more of the customs of other countries than their less neat and cleanly neighbours the names of the couple who resided on this snot were john and marion telfer their history i am now going to relate john was the only son of an honest industrious couple who lived in the neighbourhood of langholm but who unfortunately both died of a fever when he was little more than ten years old leaving him nothing but their blessing and thc virtuous habits of integrity and obedience in which they had trained him from his earliest youth on their deathbed they entreated that the excellent clergyman who in spite of the malignity of the disease continued to comfort and pray by them in their last moments would take compassion on their poor kttle orphan and find him employment among the neighbouring formers either as a herdhoy to some of the numerous flocks of sheep which arc common in eskdale or a ploughboy in their fields mr martin for such was thc name of the pious pastor assured them that he would do all in his power for their chikl and lie kept his word for as soon as they were dead he took thc boy home to hil own house and there endeavoured by kindness and sympathy to console him forhjs great and irreparable loss for some days ail ins endeavours were unsuccessful john though sensible of the kind attentions of mr murtin still felt miserable and unhappy all his dear mothers care and tenderness all thc pains and trouble that his kind father used to take in teaching him to read his bible after perhaps a hard days work thc delight with which they both watched his improvementall all rose to poor johns mind aud made him believe he newer more could be happy mr martin at last seeing the boys melancholy continue thought that a little employment might serve to rouse him he therefore one morning called john into hi study and asked him if he would be so good as to assist in dusting anel arranging some books which mere in a large chest in the  corner ofthe room john from lowness of spirits did not much like to bc employed  but as he had been taught by his father always to be obedient and to do at once whatever he was desired he immediately set about dusting thc books thc first two or three he merely wiped aud put them down without looking at them but at last rubbing one a leaf fell out which obligee him to open the book to put it back again the work happened to be a handsome edition of robinson crusoe with very beautiful prints mr martin who was watching him unobserved culled to him to bring the book and then told him he might look at the pictures if he pleased jolm who had never seen any thing of thc kind before was delighted with this permission and placing himself at a little distance so as not to disturb mr martin began turning over the leaves  his eyes sparkling and his little hands trembling with increased delight at every new scene that was represented at last he came to the one where man friday is saved from the savages here his curiosity got the better of the natural awe he felt for air martin  and he cried out  pray sir lie so good as to tell me what this meansfor though john had been taught to read his bible as well as his poor father was capable of teaching yet this was in so imperfect a way that he could by no means read easily and was obliged to spell more than half his words mr martin smiled goodnaturedly as johns exclamation made him raise his head from the book he was reading and desiring him to come near his chair he explained at some length what the print represented after which he asked john if he would not like to be able to read the story himself jolm immediately answered o dear yes sir that i should  but looking down and the tears starting into his eyes  that can never be now  for my dear father is dead and gone and nobody else will ever take thc trouble to teach so poor a boy jw i am anti yet continued he looking in mr martins face and brightening a little with a kind of hope  dont you think sir that if i succeed in getting a place and if i am very very attentive and alway taite pains to please my master i may in time be able to save out of my wage as much as a penny u week  for i know if i could do that i might so to the school at langholm 1 remember nearing my poor dear father wsh very much that he could afford to pay so much money forme as he said he waa sure that mr campbell would teach me to read much beater than he could the history proceeds through the innocent details of life such as it might bc found in a valley in the primitive age the young peasant grows up la understanding and morals and the ministers family is the place of tranquil virtue but there conies a disturbance to all this quiet in the conduct of a son the minister has hot had the power of communicating his own spirit to his turbulent boy and brother william runs off to sea leaving helen in sorrow the effects of this disobedience tire however most injurious to hil parents his mother overwhelmed with sorrow takes to her bed the scene that follows is pictured with great artlessness and we think with peculiar feeling letters arrive from william mentioning his having fixed himself on board a ship going to sea helen folded up the letters and sat for a few minutes considering on their content her own good sense and feelings of obedience to her parents pointed out to her in how very improper a style her brother wrote  but her love and affection for winiam made her try to excuse him  boys are so different from girls thought she  william hat been away so much too from home and besides he must chase a profession and rt would be hard not to leave him at liberty to be what he thinks himself flt for in the evening of this doy mrs martin felt herself better and for thc first time since her illness spoke to her husband on the subject of william mr martin told her he was with her brother and likewise that he had heard from himself he thea stated what captain elliott had said as to williams being allowed to remain with him but owned he was very averse to this pian mrs martin answered very calmly  my dear husband as fur as my judgement goes i perfectly agree with my brother i would not certainly have chosen that william should be a sailorif i could have prevented it hut as he has acted i think it is thc best thing we can now do he will be under my dear brothers care  and i shall now  controlled she looking at her husband with tendcitwsa  die in peace on hw account convinced fhat elliott will exert every means to correct and improve my poor boy thc last legacy of dying sister mr martin quite alarmed by this address asked lier if she felt herself worse and rose to send for mr armstrong she krid her hand gently on his arm  my dearest love said she  i am not woree bm i own i have been watching for an opportunity of preparing your mtnd for what i believe

his management  and i trust he will endeavour to guard his father from all future anxiety on his account he has cost him epiite enough already the last words were spoken so low that they were evidently not meant for her husbands ear isle had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking when she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer a few days showed plainly that mrs martin knew her own situation but too well she appeared gradually though slowly sinking one evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  i shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed she then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to william anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before it may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then mr martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her one evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health he therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish i will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer leave me for a few minutes you may trust me i will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father mr martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife in half an hour helen and her father were at mrs martins bedside she smiled faintly when she perceived them holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband my dear i wish much to see my mother pray write for her she will i inn sure gratify me mr martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to melrose mrs martin then took hold of helens hand and said  my clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me the length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of mrs m to her excellent daughter it thus concludes helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed when she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing she then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air she obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors mrs ms mother mrs elliott arrived the next day when mrs martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt melrose ind come to live at the manse mr martin assured her that she should ever be considered by him os his own mother his wife joined their hands exclaiming my work is finished in this world i have now only to look forward to another and a better her work in this world did indeed seem finished the next day without any apparent change for the worse as her mother and helen were sitting by thc bedside and her kind anxious husband was supporting her in his arms she laid her head on his shoulder and seemed to fall asleep it was some minutes before he was aware that she was gone for ever thus perished one of the best and most exemplary of mothers entirely from anxious

young benjamin franklin or the right road through life a boys book on a boys own subject by henry mayhew with illus trations by john gilbert bryce young benjamin franklin is a biographic fiction that will meet with readers of mature years who will lay it aside acknowledging that it is healthy in tone and amusing notwithstanding the many violations of artistic orthodoxy which render it useless as a memoir and unsound as a view of life in his preface mr mayhew defends himself by anticipation against the censure to which he feels he has rendered himself liableand in doing so explains both thc object and the internal structure of his work i give he says the present volume to the youth of the time in the hope that it may serve them for what i myself felt the want of more than anything after leaving westminster school as a young man crammed to the tip of ones tongue with latin and greek and nothing else viz for something like a guide to what uncle ben calls the right road through life to accomplish this undertaking an endeavour is made to set forth though means by which benjamin franklin acquired that purpose and will which not only raised him to the foremost rank of transatlantic statesmen and scholars but also enabled him emphatically to lead thc lifo of goodness the opening chapters in which little ben is displayed in the domestic circle of the boston tallowchandler pinned down to the ungrateful occupation of cutting wicks in readiness for  melting day dreading his fathers penal  strap devouring the pages of  robinson crusoe and running away from the home to which he is brought back penitent and scared aro of no common merit indeed they arouse a hope that the succeeding chapters will give a vigorous picture of the society so admirably adapted for literary illustration in which the early years of franklin were passed no such portrait is however attempted with the conclusion of part i mr mayhew may be said to bid farewell to his subject as faras nature and troth are concerned little ben bet ween the years often and twelve ls given over to the tutelage of his uncle ben who takes him about boston to see life and instils into his ductile mind the precepts of morality and philosophic observation though child and his mentor visit the palaces of the rich aud the garrets of the poor penetrate workhouses and jails and hold edifying conversations on the pleasures of art the world of opinion  though purport of intellectual pleasure and other similar subjects of a metaphysical nature that little boys often years old are known to prefer to skating or squalcs surely so practical a writer as mr mayhew does not need to be told that the intellectual and moral characteristics of a remarkable man cannot reasonably be accounted for by showing that he enjoyed the advantages of associating with a septuagenarian who poured into his ear sonorous preachings about tning3 in general which like coleridges monologues commenced without premises und ceased without conclusions let mr mayhew be honest and confess how much ho remembers of his experiences of ten and twelve apart from flogging and birchrods has ho a dozen vivid reminiscences of his early westminster career franklins character was formed by the stern lessons taught him in the school of adversity by the stirring events of contemporary history by the political atmosphere he breathed in early manhood and more than all by the characters of thc men with whom he as a bold and inquiring young man was brought into contact but mr mayhews theory astounding as it is has more kinship to troth than have the pictures with which he endeavours to sustain it the life to which little ben is introduced is london life in the year of out lord 1861 not boston life in the last century there is not even an attempt to impart an american colouring or an air of historic fidelity to these deportations from the banks of the thames the fop and the miser the gourmet and the dnmkard are of sound old british oak without any touch of yankee veneering so also uncle ben is the peculiar product of the nineteenth century being compounded in equal parts of wordsworth lord shaftesbury ami mr buckle in his preface mr mayhew argues that he is justified in creating uncle ben and giving him such prominence in the drama by that shakspeorian nile of art  which often throws an internal moral principle into an external dvamaiis pmmtn as the witches in  macbeth are merely the outward embodiment in a weird and shadowy form of macbeths own ambition and have obviously been introduced into the play with the view of giving a kind of haunted and fatalistic air to a bloody and devouring passion even so in a small way has uncle ben here been made the exponent of the franklin view of life but herein lies the difference between the witches in  macbeth and the uncle ben of the childs story shakespeares conception was in accordance with historic truth and the notiorh relative to supernaturalism that existed in his day and were believed by his auditors to have existed in the days of macbeth whilst mr mayhews conception is directly at variance alike with events and opinions the prison visited by little ben and his uncle in boston a hundred years since is the author informs us what does the reader imaginetothill fields prison as it appeared in 1856 how could a sight of thc abuses of our modern system of prison discipline have had a part in fashioning the mind of franklin  it would be ns reasonable to write the life of peter the great showing that his whole aftercareer was the result of his reading vanity fair or hearing of the balaclava charge,juvenile

stories and fairy tales by hans christian andersen tranislated by h oskar sommer phd with loo pictures by a j gskin 2 vols each 6s george allen all the stories are here not the fairy ones alone that is one point to be noted about the book reading andersen in a practically complete edition like thisfor one always forgets to remember his novelsone is struck by the excellence of even his average work he wrote a little handful of stories that deserve immortality but as can be seen here out of the slightest of motiveshecould make something at least pretty his talent his art never forsook him even when his genius was not alight dr sommers translation is exceedingly good it is so very simple that you may not see at first its real skill but read a few of the stories through and its charm steals over you it is simple not in the sense that it condescends to children but with the simplicity of good literature the translators work should receive recognition we hope it may and that mr gaskin for all his merits may not run away with all the praise a good many of mr gaskins drawings for the book will have been seen at the arts and crafts exhibition where they had an honoured place and no wonder the school of draughtmanship to which outwardly he belongs has prodiiced a great deal of work beautiful regarded as mere decorati n but which set to illustrate tales of real moving human life is unsatisfactoryit delights the eye but it is not what illustrations should be a commentary on an illumination of the text this cannot be said of the pictures here while altogether removed from commonplace realism they are yet instinct with life with feeling with humour the tenderness in the loveliest rose of the world in the bond of friendship in  ib and christine and in the wild swans is quite as remarkable as the beautiful detail the decorative qualities in  the marsh kings daughter  the daisy  the goloshes of fortune and  a leaf from heaven to name only a few many words are not needed to express hearty appreciation the whole hundred of them are pictures not merely to admire but to linger over with keen delight the volumes are good specimens of printing indeed mr gaskin is only the chief collaborator in the production of two volumes of rare artistic excellence which have been issued too not as editions de luxe but which are within the reach of at least a very great many who value good work rie loveliest rose in mhe world from i stories and fairy tales by h c andercn  allun the marsh kings daughter from stories and fairy tales by h c andersen g allen  fairy tales fairies may be simple or sophisticated beautiful or hideous friendly or hateful prim and precise or tanglehaired and teasing  but whatever they are their adventures should always be told simply its hopeless to make a fuss about the fairies the fuss aesthetic the fuss of folklore the fuss moralizing the fuss gruesome all of these are ruin for a fairy tale for children the best authors have been guilty at times there are moments when even andersen makes the reader sit up with an indignant  that didnt happen and then with a delicate pop away goes the fairy tale and ones happy credulity the best stories are the old stories told quite simply  they may be in language a little conventional as was the language of mrs freers  old deccan days  and some of the older versions of the  arabian nights but they must have that gravity that respectful manner which show that the author does not regard his work with anything but a serious craftsmans interesthe is neither writing down norworse horror writing up of our ghristmas fairy books this year one is written by a man who has a touch a little beyond talent mr james stephens in irish fairy tales macmillan 15s net has not forgotten that he is writing for children  he keeps his humour and his rather rascally gaiety and the wisdom in his stories of fionn and oisin bran and mongan is quiet and unobtrusive he gives too a definition of fairyland which may serve for the older ones as well as for the children   everything that is here is there but the things that are there are better than those that are here all things that are bright are there brighter there is more gold in the sun and more silver in the moon of that land there is more scent on the flowers more savour in the fruit there is more comeliness in the men and more tenderness in the women mr rackhams pictures are amazing in their grotesque fancy the reptiles the uncanny rocks the ogreish people could not be bettered  but his beautiful people are not of fairyland

could be given to  bengal fairy tales lane 15s net by mr bradley birt the book has many merits it gives us some new tales and it has illustrations of interest rather than beauty by abanindranath

by robert de borron and lucas de gast it is a difficult book to appraise fairly of miss pauls high decorative skill there is no doubt there are initials and borders here which not only derive from the book of kells but could bear looking at beside that splendour some of her crowded swift little pictures have the genuine thrill which the low ceilings and hot atmosphere of rossetti can give there is too a real touch of individuality about the pictures especially about the figures  miss paul is a truer mediaevalist than were the preraphaelite brothers yet there is a slight affectation in the work and a good deal in the text miss paul will not be as simple as she knows how and so misses the reward which she might have miss chaundler has rifled the old legends in  arthur and his knights  nisbet

here and there durbar by dennis kincaid 7s 6d chatto  windus the lord of life by neil bell 7s 6d collins doverostend by  taffrail 7s 6d hodder  stoughton mammon by robert neumann 7s 6d peter davies the rest is silence bv c and  scharten antink s 6d rich  cowan these five novels can be safely recommended to readers in search of stories which are far removed from the doings of everyday english life mlr kincaid takes us to an indian native state and the two foreign novels deal with international finance and life in italian prisons mr bell and  taffrail certainly begin their stories with conventional english backgrounds but they soon sweep us into adventures and excitements which have nothing in common with our ordinary experience the most exotically minded reader can hardly complain that these five authors have not served him well  durbar  is mr kincaids first novel and his account of twentyfour crowded hours in the life of an indian state is written with freshness and vigour some of his descriptive passages are slightly overloaded with detail but that is a small fault in a book which has so many virtues the rajah who was educated at oxford his unhappy wife and the princess indira who sponsors the plot against him are vividly realised characters and their strangeness is well contrasted with the western equanimity of the british resident and his wife the discovery and overthrow of the plot to assassinate the rajah lead to an unexpected climax which brings with it the dawn of a new hope for the imaginary state in which the action has taken place the story is tense and exciting but the great value of  durbar lies in its picture of a section of indian life which is quite different from the usual angloindian scene mr neil bell begins his new novel with a study of a small shopkeeper in a provincial town but the ham and beef shop at the corner of franklin road is swept away in the general chaos when a scientist annihilates several atoms and destroys the civilised world a number of men and one woman who were making a trial trip in a new submarine are lucky enough to survive and the responsibility for preserving the human race devolves on this small community mr bell has made good use of the opportunities which such a situation provides but the experiences of his solitary heroine in an otherwise male community become in the end a little monotonous there is no monotony however in  taffrails crosschannel thriller doverostend an innocent lieutenant commander comes back to england for the simple delights of five weeks leave and before the first evening is over he is in the hands of a gang of villains who force him to take a reluctant part in an act of piracy in the english channel the story is told in a pleasantly breezy manner and the author almost makes us believe that it would be quite feasible for a gang of criminals to hold up a crosschannel steamer on its way from dover to ostend herr robert neumanns mammon  is a strange and uneven work which seeks to depict the ramifications and chicanery of international finance much of the book is interesting and it is often amusing but the development of the plot is so intricate that only readers with a considerable store of patience will be able to follow herr neumann from beginning to end the dutch authors of  the rest is silence have told a simple story of a convict in an italian prison who is sustained in his years of captivity by the vision of a womanprisoner whom he hopes to meet again when he is freed there is a certain charm in the study of peasant character but the authors have failed to create any real feelings of sympathy for their distinctly sordid hero edgar holt  photo by e 0 oppi don marquis whose striking drama ox the betrayal and trial of christ the dark hours was published recently by mr jonathan cape here and there too many of the stories in mrs whartons new book do no more than exhibit her craftsmanship of that there is now no doubt and it is a pity that she should expend time on themes which rouse her ingenuity challenge her skill but little and do not really move her unmoved herself she cannot move the reader only in two tales does she achieve the effect of having something that must be said of presenting characters with whom she has lived and whom she desires us to know the fates and the mischances of them one of the stories is a tale of  beyond  bewitched it has something of the indeterminate fear that belongs to the genuine as distinct from the manufactured ghost story how rutledge was haunted with what ghostly visitor he made his rendezvous and how their intimacy was finally dissolved remains uncertain what is not uncertain is the power and the suggestive discomfort of the story the hard farmers orrin bosworth deacon hibben and sylvester brend saul rutledge deceiving or deceived mrs rutledge harsh determined not to be deceivedall these characters live and there is a deadly determination in the way in which their combined efforts do to death someone or something frail and beautiful helpless in momentary beauty better still is  the seed of the faith a story of a mission in morocco and its hopeless ignorant yet not ignoble struggle in the face of triumphant sensuality and hard bitter confident religion it is surprising in this story how mrs wharton contrives to make you respect and even like the old missionary half crazy in his final spurt of misguided zeal while your reason and your charity can only condemn his stupidity and his bigotry mr oflahertys temptation is overabundance not since maupassant i think has there been a writer who can so quickly make out of an incident a glimpse an overheard scrap of dialogue a broken fragment of memory something which arrests the attention quickens the blood or numbs the mind his very skill leads him at times to take subjects or incidents scarcely worthy of his power and this volume in spite of some halfdozen really magnificently wrought vignettes cannot be put on a level with that admirable and haunting novel he gave us last  the informer the best things in this book are however equal to the best he has given usthat is they rank with maupassants work and kiplings early sketches as supreme examples of the realistic method yet there is more than realism in mr oflahertys tales he is never as detached as maupassantand he was never completely detachedfor he is always ridden by the angel of pity and haunted   here and beyond by edith wharton appletonthe tent by liam oflaherty jonathan cape three or more graces by aldous huxley chatto  windus the domino club by allen upward faber  gwyer 7s 6d each by the demon of anger and his own view of life comes out not only in his treatment but in his choice of subjects while his sketches of irish life of rebels perverts peasants lawyers politicians are scrupulously unflattering they are never unfair if we get in  the outcast a portrait of a priest who serves belial rather than christ we get in  charity  a portrait of a kindness which only christianity has fostered and is ready to defend the simple kindness of a child or a wise fool there is a wild humour in a few of the sketches as in  a red petticoat and mr oflaherty betrays the same flaming impatience at the war in ireland as inspires mr ocaseys work one story in the book a terrible even revolting story  the sensualist might almost have been written by tolstoy for in it mr oflaherty definitely abandons the pure realistic method and writes a tract of extreme bitterness and force against the crazy sensualism which indulged in carries man back to the impersonal animal life out of which he has slowly emerged that there are more ways than one of slipping back into that older world can be learned from the first and most important of the stories in mr huxleys new book i cannot agree with those who see in  three or more graces the best work mr huxley has yet done it is more ambitious in theme than any he has yet attempted but he is not yet equal to the theme either emotionally o r spiritually you cannot be witty with such a subject as the dissolution of personality unless you are frankly writing farce and mr huxley has not helped matters by trying to soften the edges of his wit by the appalling and tiresome mono logues of kingham kingham seems to me a character borrowed from one of mr d h lawrences novels even in the wild exotic world of that novelist it is difficult to believe that these creatures misbehaviours would be tolerated i am quite sure kingham would be kicked often and hardactually or metaphoricallyin the politic world of mr huxley grace comfrey married to john peddley mr huxley has a great talent for names is a woman who is always as it were framing herself she sees herself as this or that definite type and within the limitations of the type behaves congruously the disasters which occur to her through her lack of a fixed personality are only what might be expected in an age with no fixed standards mr huxley is unusual among the younger novelists in his realisation of the excessive boredom and the more excessive tiresomeness of  free  modern society it is like a dirtyminded dormitory he follows graces changes with remarkable patience but he has not really enough imaginative sympathy to show us the woman herself or to show us the lack of a self this is not harsh criticism it is only saying that mr huxley has not yet got the emotional experience to deal adequately with a subject that might have taxed dostoievsky the other stories are slighter and variations on themes which mr huxley has already almost exhausted  the monocle is one more study in dirt noise inanity and vanity  halfholiday is a savage little attack on the more idiotic more selfish society woman  fairy godmother is another warning to elderly charmers to be careful when mr huxley is taking notes he has not been bored by vain women for nothingnro will be mr upward has written much better books than  the domino club and i hope he will do so again it is difficult to be more than politely unimpressed by this very conventional story of the young medical man and the

three months under the snow i tnis is one of those delightful books which young readers will peruse with all the interest of robinson crusoe and which many old folks too will etoy with equal pleasure we heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents during seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of switzerland known as the jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers but during the other five months from may until october the scene changes then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass allured by the latter attraction the swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of jura on these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies the scene of the narrative of  three months under the snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the jura one of these i shepherds frangoisthe father of pierre lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and pierre accompanied by louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent in the course of ascent up the mountain pierre has the  thee ontihe under the snow the journal of a yon inhabitant of the jun tranuated fro the french of oldpomowha rigiu tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot no particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to i be the pivot on which the whole plot turns on arriving at the pasture ground pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure the whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home the father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings the father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm franjois before he reaches the village meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment i called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   poor blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  the wind roared violently it rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chalet would have been carried away i lifted my head several times fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults the shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind he then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable when the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings she seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us how greedily she ate the handful of salt that i gave her her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain she gave us a good pailful of milk such is our introduction to blanchette before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison on the regularity indeed with which she yields her milk the lives of the prisoners are found in a great measure to depend up to this time although the wind iwa been roaring around the mountain cottage there had been nothing to indicate that positive danger had set in on the following morning however when i i pierre awoke he was surprised to find himself in complete darkness at first he thought that his sleep had left him at an earlier hour than usual  grandfather he cried  you are up before daylight  my dear boy replied the old man  if we were to wait the light of day we should remain long enough in bed i fear the snow is above thewindow the terrible truth at last flashed on the mind they were entombed in the snow which had fallen thickly and heavily during the night they knew too from experience that there was little or no prospect of obtaining relief until the spring returned it is at this point that the peculiar value of the book as teaching presence of mind in danger and cheerful confidence in providence appears the old man who is pious takes a hopeful view of things and like mariners on a raft after the wreck of their vessel the little party begins to scrutinise the stores that are left to enable them to accomplish their arctic voyage pierre seeing that a glimmering of the sun appears down the chimney through a part which the snow has not choked up manages to emerge to the roof of the chalet  i but as nothing but bleak desolation meets his gaze he speedily comes down again a fire is lighted but in the midst of their confusion the little hut itself gets nearly burned down by the kindling of  some straw still their hearts do not fail to guard against similar emergencies they fill a tub with snow and place it beside the fireplace ready to extinguish any future conflagration their situation too is not found so cheerless as might have been imagined happily their wooden clock keeps correct time so that they do not lose their reckoning there is plenty of hay also for blanchette on whose life theirs now depend a limited stock of potatoes is also discovered while a bottle or two of swiss wine and some three loaves of hard mountain bread with a few other trifles turn up pierre likewise in the course of his researches finds an axe some straw to plait into hats and what proves a greater treasure still an old work of devotion which supplies them with admirable counsel in their difficulties leading them to earnest prayer to god for his protection and for the improvement of the trials which he has sent to them blanchette moreover is brought from the stable to the hut and proves pleasant company for them a month or more passes in this was pierre takes another journey to the roof and watching carefully the mode in which the snow lies conceives it possible to digg away some of the superincumbent portions of it so as to open the door and admit light to the window the brave and noble boy at the risk of much inconvenience and peril accomplishes his obect and once more the light of day refracted from piles of glittering snow and ice breaks in upon them they have not time however to enjoy this very much before another snowstorm sets in blocking the cottage doors and windows and covering the roof with a heavier load than before the old mans piety comes again to his aid and he encourages his nephew not to despond but to believe that this disappointment is ordered b7 providence for wise purposesa conclusion which is proved by the event but we must take the narration of this incident from the work itself december 13thwe had a dreadful alarm yesterday today even i can scarcely collect my thoughts enough to write down what has passed alas we are not yet sure that we have escaped all danger i was busy milking the goat while my grandfather was lighting the fire suddenly she pricked up her ears as if she heard some extraordinary noise and began to tremble all over swhat is the matter poor blanchette  i said caressing her but immediately we heard the most dreadful howlings as if it were over our heads  wolves i exclaimed silence my boy caress blanehette said my grandfather and he approached her himself and gave her some salt she continued to tremble and the howlings continued also well louis said he in a low voice  what would have become of us had you opened a passage to the window who knows if even the chimney might not have afforded a passage to those ravenous beasts   and do you think we are safe even as we are p i  i hope sobut speak low and do not cease to caress blanchetteher bleating might betray us one would have thought that she had the same fears for she did not make the slighitest noise my grandfather came and sat down by me i held the goat in my arms he had his hand laid upon my shoulder and i needed all the encouragement of his calm and serene countenance to keep me from shrieking aloud with fright au that i had previously experienced in the chalet could not be compared to the agony of yesterday throughout the whole day we passed it by the side of blanchette and at several intervals we heard the howlings of the wolves at one time it was so loud that i thought my last hour was come they are digging through the snow i cried clasping my grandfather in my arms they will i get in and devour us  the grandfather calms him however and the danger passes away the wolves it is conjectured had not scented the rich prize below but had brought the carcass of some animal and made the outcry which alarmed the inmates of the cottage by their quarling as they devoured their prey as the winter advanced a more serious trouble arose to daunt the heart of poor pierre for his grandfather unable to stand the severe cold gradually drooped and finally died what followed is well calculated to teach young people the value of calmness selfpossession and moral courage most boys under similar circumstances would have been iin danger of losing their reason but pierre encouraged by the excellent advice which his grandfather had given him before his death bears up even under his new trial the scene in which he is represented as digging a grave for his grandfather and interring him is not only admirably painted but divested of all repulsive features our youang hero was now lft alonea solitary hermit on the top of the jurawith nothing but his goat blanchette to keep him company and iyet he was not quit alone either for as mungo p ark was cheered in the african desert by seeing a flower so pierre was reminded of the omnipresence of the great creator by another equally striking incident a piece of rubbish had fallen down his chimney the noise attracted his attention and as apprehensive of the soot having taken fire he looked up an iron tube which sewved as an escape for the smoke a star passed over its orifice crossing it slowly at its greatest breadth the appearance lasted but a moment yet it affected pierre greatly reminding him that even in his forlorn condition apparently forgotten by every human being there was one to whom he could make known by prayer his wants and difficulties he had indeed poor fellow need of all the comfort he could get for one morning he heard around him what sounded like the final cruh of naturethe ceiling cracked pieces of plaster fell and a portion of the wall of the cottage lost its perpendicular after the uproar had ceased he began to fear that an avalanche had fallen in his neighbourhood covering for aught he knew the chalet with its fragments however the shock roused him from a state of dejection to face a new and perhaps more perplexing difficulty blanchette the goat began to cease giving her milka dreadful discovery for it threatens to reduce him to the cruel alternative of starvation or of killing the poor animal which has cheered by its company his solitary hours from day to day the condition of blanchette is recorded in pierres diary and we read with deep interest the accounts which show the allimportant milk to be continually diminishing  january 27the milk decreases and the goat fattens in proportion  february 2she has given even less milk than the day before and i have gained nothing but the pain of hearing her bleat most sorrowfully for more than half the day  february 8i will own my weakness i shed tears today when i made a last vain attempt to milk blanchette when she saw me stoop she gave me a look of defiance as if she were standing on her guard against any further attempt i threw away my pail i sat down near the poor beast embraced her and wept bitterly what is the poor fellow to do now  it breaks his heart to think of killing the affectionate animal ah happily his trials are well nigh over on the 24th of february he lighted his fire scarcely had he done so when the smoke began to ascend and he heard a great noise without at first he thought it was the wolves which had returned but human voices are heard hailing him quicker and quicker come the strokes of the pickaxe and shoveland in a short time fierre is embraced in the arms of his father attended by a host of rejoicing neighbours poor pierre and blanchette are saved l,juvenile

young benjamin franklin or the right road through life a boys book on a boys own subject by henry mayhew with illus trations by john gilbert bryce young benjamin franklin is a biographic fiction that will meet with readers of mature years who will lay it aside acknowledging that it is healthy in tone and amusing notwithstanding the many violations of artistic orthodoxy which render it useless as a memoir and unsound as a view of life in his preface mr mayhew defends himself by anticipation against the censure to which he feels he has rendered himself liableand in doing so explains both thc object and the internal structure of his work i give he says the present volume to the youth of the time in the hope that it may serve them for what i myself felt the want of more than anything after leaving westminster school as a young man crammed to the tip of ones tongue with latin and greek and nothing else viz for something like a guide to what uncle ben calls the right road through life to accomplish this undertaking an endeavour is made to set forth though means by which benjamin franklin acquired that purpose and will which not only raised him to the foremost rank of transatlantic statesmen and scholars but also enabled him emphatically to lead thc lifo of goodness the opening chapters in which little ben is displayed in the domestic circle of the boston tallowchandler pinned down to the ungrateful occupation of cutting wicks in readiness for  melting day dreading his fathers penal  strap devouring the pages of  robinson crusoe and running away from the home to which he is brought back penitent and scared aro of no common merit indeed they arouse a hope that the succeeding chapters will give a vigorous picture of the society so admirably adapted for literary illustration in which the early years of franklin were passed no such portrait is however attempted with the conclusion of part i mr mayhew may be said to bid farewell to his subject as faras nature and troth are concerned little ben bet ween the years often and twelve ls given over to the tutelage of his uncle ben who takes him about boston to see life and instils into his ductile mind the precepts of morality and philosophic observation though child and his mentor visit the palaces of the rich aud the garrets of the poor penetrate workhouses and jails and hold edifying conversations on the pleasures of art the world of opinion  though purport of intellectual pleasure and other similar subjects of a metaphysical nature that little boys often years old are known to prefer to skating or squalcs surely so practical a writer as mr mayhew does not need to be told that the intellectual and moral characteristics of a remarkable man cannot reasonably be accounted for by showing that he enjoyed the advantages of associating with a septuagenarian who poured into his ear sonorous preachings about tning3 in general which like coleridges monologues commenced without premises und ceased without conclusions let mr mayhew be honest and confess how much ho remembers of his experiences of ten and twelve apart from flogging and birchrods has ho a dozen vivid reminiscences of his early westminster career franklins character was formed by the stern lessons taught him in the school of adversity by the stirring events of contemporary history by the political atmosphere he breathed in early manhood and more than all by the characters of thc men with whom he as a bold and inquiring young man was brought into contact but mr mayhews theory astounding as it is has more kinship to troth than have the pictures with which he endeavours to sustain it the life to which little ben is introduced is london life in the year of out lord 1861 not boston life in the last century there is not even an attempt to impart an american colouring or an air of historic fidelity to these deportations from the banks of the thames the fop and the miser the gourmet and the dnmkard are of sound old british oak without any touch of yankee veneering so also uncle ben is the peculiar product of the nineteenth century being compounded in equal parts of wordsworth lord shaftesbury ami mr buckle in his preface mr mayhew argues that he is justified in creating uncle ben and giving him such prominence in the drama by that shakspeorian nile of art  which often throws an internal moral principle into an external dvamaiis pmmtn as the witches in  macbeth are merely the outward embodiment in a weird and shadowy form of macbeths own ambition and have obviously been introduced into the play with the view of giving a kind of haunted and fatalistic air to a bloody and devouring passion even so in a small way has uncle ben here been made the exponent of the franklin view of life but herein lies the difference between the witches in  macbeth and the uncle ben of the childs story shakespeares conception was in accordance with historic truth and the notiorh relative to supernaturalism that existed in his day and were believed by his auditors to have existed in the days of macbeth whilst mr mayhews conception is directly at variance alike with events and opinions the prison visited by little ben and his uncle in boston a hundred years since is the author informs us what does the reader imaginetothill fields prison as it appeared in 1856 how could a sight of thc abuses of our modern system of prison discipline have had a part in fashioning the mind of franklin  it would be ns reasonable to write the life of peter the great showing that his whole aftercareer was the result of his

i the crock of gold i l by james stephens w1acknijan d uo whe mr stephens published his first collection of verses a few critics were keen enough to discern a new and gmenn voice possessing a note of its own after a while came the charwomans daurhter and showed plainly that a writer of proe had emerged too now in the crock of gold this author gives the measure of a larger and more individual talent than could have been absolutely foretold his work is neither a fairy tale nor an essay nor an allegory nor a novel although it has features of all these forms there has been nothing hitherto quite like it but it is safe to prophesy that by and by there will be plenty of imitators to take it for their pattern in some respects the book is characteristically irish modern english writers can introduce fairies but they cannot succeed in treating them quite as a matter of course even mr barrie seems to be always hinting to us how pretty and quaint his fairies are but to mr stephens as to mr yeatsand formerly to blakefairies are as natural as sparrows neither irishman would feel a quiver of surprise at encountering a  leprecaun  in any woodland walk nor deem that there was any incongruity in the association upon the same page of leprecauns and policemen indeed one of the triumphs of the crock of gold  is the mingling of the wildest fantasies with sudden gleams of melancholy realism in chap xvi the philosopher who forms the connecting thread of the narrative is lying awake in prison hearing the lifehistories of his two companionsunvarnished tales of contemporary poverty and privation such as might but for their beautiful simplicity of style have come straight from the registers of the charty organisation society in chap xvii the child ad the fosterchild of the phlsher are carrying back a crock of gol t the leprecauns and afterwards resting themlv against the flanks of a friendly cow and hearing her highly instructive conversation with a fly we read on without a jar and every now and then some wise or whimsical saying arrests our delighted progress a lite later perhaps aim like a view through a suddenly unshuttered window the picture of southeast landscape painted in a few words the style which conveys these excellent thring reminds us now of one good writer now of another but never of a bad one and in spite of these links of kindred remains alwa personal in its flavour in short mr stephens has produced a remarkably fine and attractive work of art  the crock of gold fiction by james stephens macmillan and co 5s it is a very excellent thing when the watcher on the toweras the reviewer is imagined to be by the guileless of heartmay leave his post and simply pull a joyous peal on the bells of praise it is splendid to sheathe the sword on ones hipto think for one moment of the petty scalpel of criticism by so dignified a titleand to pull vigorously on because the merry clangour over ones head is the only thing proportionate to the joy in the soul really that office is won more often than it would appear when it takes a little courage to fulfil it but no courage should be needed in the case of the  crock of gold the crock of gold itself has little to do with the subject neither have the two philosophers nor their two respective wives the grey woman of dun gorrin and the thin woman of inis magrath nor for that matter their two children nor the leprechauns nor pan nor angus og nor caitilin ni murrachu there is only one person who has anything to do with the book and that is mr stephens who has given some considerable care to blake and a good deal of care to his own devilment in fact he has given so much care to blake that he has not altogether digested that mighty mans st heme of things being too content to give it speech cn his own lips with a disorder of idea that it had not in its originators brain that is an incidental complaint common to most of blakes readers who cannot step quite as decisively as the strong man himself did in the involutions of his scheme of things but the inspiring spirit is here and it gives a singing beauty to mr stephens own devilment that devilment is undeniable it both makes and mars the book it was a very good thing for one of the two philosophers and his wife the grey woman of dun gortin that they in a surfeit of life spun round like tops till they died or they would have added to the number of people in whom our interest is aroused to remain unresolved at the end of the book caitilin ni murrachu leaves pan for angus og and that is an end of herand a very good end too one may say but her father meehawl macmurrachu who stole the crock of gold and was singularly afflicted by the leprechauns in consequence is never heard of again the surviving philosopher is rescued from prison by the shoe after their hosting we are told but the manner of it we are not told nor are we told why the she hosted nor what came of it in the larger purpose of things the book concludes with four dots to signify a conclusion that is no conclusion the remaining half a page should have been filled with dots had mr stephens wished adequately to signify the unconcluded interest but the characters happen not to be the matter of our interest it is mr stephens who provides that interest and the characters are only by way of a framework on which he may stretch himself we have spoken of hts spirit in the book as one of devilment but it must be understood that it is that manner of devilment that is full of wisdom the inspiration of which indeed is wisdom no man can dance down the road and leap and laugh in the sun and pluck flowers where he will and stretch in the fields when he will without having joy in his heart and he cannot have that joy in his heart without having wisdom in his soul he cannot tell us that wisdom since wisdom defies the intellect he can only communicate that joy to us and we may find the wisdom for ourselves the phrase of his song the light in his eyes the sunlight on a blossom in his hand may communicate that joy to us but if it cannot it will not so irresponsible is it and such is the procedure of the book being what it is it is a little matter that it is unconcluded or that its characters are not taken to the end of their history in the tangle of interest aroused by the crock of gold even as it is a small matter that the song sung on the roadside should lack an ending the manner of the singing was all there and the manner of the telling is all here it is such chance things that recreate the sunshine that is the air of joy and wisdom not a wellframed tale and a concluded interest we can scarcely imagine anyone reading this book without having a sunshine kindled in his soul and without looking with a kindlier and wiser eye on his dear mother earth and his brother man and if mr stephens wants a better praise than that then he is a different man from that we have taken him for  the crock of gold by james stephens london macmillan ss net mr stephens makes a mortal maid and her divine bridegroom sing to the lovers of gaiety a song which ends  has the attorney enchanted thee    come away for the game has begun lightly the wind is sounding over the hill the sun laughs down into the valley and the sea leaps upon the shingle panting for joy dancing dancing dancing for joy no one who knows mr stephens poetry will doubt that he can very well sing such a song as might undo the attorneys enchantment he has a capacity for lightness and gaiety which can only be called blitheness a very rare quality blitheness runs and dances all through this narrative saves it and makes it it is unconsciously and alas too consciously also aimed against the sadness which is due to the fact that man has departed from nature and lives by crafty and twisted thought it asserts and when it does not assert it almost proves that a leprecaun is of more value to the earth than is a prime minister or a stockbroker because a leprecaun dances and makes merry while a prime minister knows nothing of these natural virtues we are positively assured that the crown of life is to be found not by the thoughtful or the good but the gay ones the adventurous ones the careless plungers an old thief declares that it is easy enough to have brains but not a little gaiety or carelessness or childishness it is however the chief merit of the book that it unconsciously declares what by an indiscretion of art it makes the subject of half a dozen sermons we are a little tired of hearing that the good are always the merry save by an evil chance but we shall never be tired of a merry heart that goes all the way through a novel of over three hundred pages the story has flaws in it which possibly mr stephens would laugh at and he can afford to since he trips on and on with so agreeable a mixture of naivete and choiceness he has never written a poem so pleasant to read nor is he likely soon to find a rival for lightness quickness and gaiety

kaffir folklore or a selection from the traditional tales current among the people living on the eastern border of the cape colony by george mccall theal son nenschein  co the stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,juvenile

the jungle book ti by rudyard kipling misc millans hitherto we have been accustomed to find inequality in mr kiplings work he has never yet given us a book entirely good each collection of his stories is a mixture of suooess and failure naturally this peculiarity has always stirred some annoyance and perplexity in his critics for at his best he is not easily surpassed while at his worst he is almost puerile there is a popular superstition not without an element of truth in it that equality and mediocrity are interchangeable terms but though no author however gifted can always be at his best the inequalities of mr kiplings work offer too startling a contrast his frequent falls from the heights to the deeps his dazzling leaps from the mire to tne mountain top cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any theory however respectable so we are unable to take up a new volume of his without knowing our hopes are dogged by a most uncomfortable fear faith in his ultimate suooess is founded tpon the fact that the more di cult his task seems though greater though certainty that he will be successful consequently if he wishes to sustain his reputation he must refuse resolutely to write on subjects commonplace or indifferent the jungle book has been cordially welcomed and it is only just to confess at once that it is more carefully designed than anything he has yet given to us there are no serious blemishes in the style and grammar as a pieoe of technique it is quite blameless but a serious doubt arises as to whether the matter of the book is at all worthy of the labour bestowed on it again it is certain that thoso flashes of genius that used to dazlo us seldom illumine its pages in them mr kiplings finest qualities are to seek we prefer to hear his men and women talk as only mulvaney or mrs hawkesby can talk be bagheora and baloo never so ingenious it is impossible to rid oneself of the conviction that any author rather more clever than the average could have contrived though greater part of th jungle book there are indeed a few pages that no one but the creator of soldiers three could have written and one new friendship is cemented for whioh we are grateful rikki tikki though only a mongoose fights his way stuantly enough into the list of mr iplings immortals the history of his war with the cobras is entirely delightful and refuses to be forgotten there are times when plain speaking is necessary and then the most ardent admirer of an author must if he be honest say the truth though truth is that the jungle book had it been written by a person unknown might have stirred a languid interest and a cor ta in reasonable hope of better things to come as the work of a man of recognised genius it compels disappointment it is generally true that to gain a worthy success a writer must toil hard must choose his words with discrimination but there is no rule without an exception and in this case mr kipling would seem to be that exception his best work achieves itself apparently spontaneously it is a startling nay dangerous thing to say of a man that he places failure far from him only when he is most careless but mr kipling may at any rate be advisedadapting a remark of mr henleys not to concern himself again with words and phrases but with the greater truths of destiny and emotion his last bcok prompts this reflection few authors know the human heart so well as he let him forsake thereforo mowglis and mules and monkeys and remember that his vital phrases have ever been born not made percy addleshaw  the jungle book  the jungle book is made up of story and song both of them rich in vitality and imagination but every time a verse occurs as the heading of a chapter one is inclined to think that mr kipling should write nothing else so instinctive is his power over vigorous rhythm and so vivid are his ballad pictures this  nightsong in the jungle  is only meant to tune you up to the pitch of the story that follows now chil

fought for freedom and it is yours eat it o wolves there is something sternly grand about all the mowgli stories imaginative children whether or not they follow the narrative with perfect comprehension will be impressed and even awestruck by the solemnity and dignity of jungle life as mr kipling paints it of the habits of the animals of the scenes amidst which they live he has a marvellous knowledge it is this picturesqe knowledge joined to a vigorous interpretation of not their own character but the ideal nature he has constructed for them a nature at once remote and familiar to us that makes the success and the fascination of the stories man without his intellectual power but with his natural faculties of sight and hearing infinitely intensified and without the enfeeblement the deceit the pettiness that are the fruits of his civilisation would be something like this conception of the beast that obeys the jungle law we are grotesquely reminded here and there of the ideals of rousseau and the natural state idealists their primitive man they would have desired to be like mr kiplings loyal beasts there are stories in the book where he is not at his highest point of vigour  the white seal  comes near to being a failure and so does  servants of the queen the adventures of rikkitikkitavi the mongoose that fought with nag the cobra and nagaina his wife are too deadly to be amusing and the glamour of imagination does not play round them to turn the terror into fascination the temperature of ones admiration having been reduced by these we find several other things to wonder at not all admiringly mr kipling cannot resist opportunities of political allusion indeed invents them and his love for playing the schoolmaster grows on him it is this quality that is at the bottom of the imperfect sympathy which runs parallel in many readers minds with a warm admiration for him the pedagogue in him hides under free and vigorous and unconventional speech but he is mostly there were he to fall asleep a bit oftener and let some careless lawless fellow take his place if even only for a few minutes mr kiplings range of understanding of human nature would be greatly widened but grumbling at mr kiplings temperament is not very relevant here it does not greatly offend in  the jungle book more to the purpose is it to point to the feats of imagination in these beast stories next to the three mowgli tales for great qualities comes  toomai of the elephants toomai is a little boy who saw what few be lieved in and none had seen the great  dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the garo hills he was on the back of the tame elephant kala nag that he tended and when kala nag got the signal for the dance the boy was born away up the wooded hill through the thick underwood through the bed of a river to a space of three or four acres where the grass was trampled and hard the assembling elephants crashed through the trees and entered the danceplace and rolled their eyes and tossed their trunks and clicked their tusks and flicked their great tails  then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs and a dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little toornai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the ground onetwo onetwo as steadily as tripbammers the elephants were stamping altogether now and it sounded like a wardrum beaten at the mouth of a cave the dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall and the booming went on and the ground rocked and shivered and little toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound but it was all one gigantic jar that ran through hinmthis stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth    the morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills and the booming stopped with the first ray as though the light had been an order it is a magnificent sight that toomai saw that night when the favour of the elephantfolk and of the gods of the jungle was with him mr kipling has some splendid visions for all his love of discipline and order it is when his spirit gets away into the wilder paths of nature and human nature that he touches

the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its author has so far given us  fiotion the valley of the moon by jack london mills  boon 6 a reasonable belief that the first novel received for 1914 was an average specimen of the coming output would enable us to wish our fellowreviewers a  happy new year  with some hopefulness of fulfilment the story is that of a workingclass couple ideally mated before their marriage he is a prizefighter and she is a laundryhand an appalling picture of the life she escapes by wedlock is given as well as more than one vivid description of his competence in the ring she is possessed of that marvellous strength of sacrifice on behalf of her man which can only be properly appreciated perhaps by those who have experienced it he has the gentleness which goes with strength under control though he all but loses it when his temper is upset by a strike of teamsters his mates in a calling which he follows after his marriage their flight from the sordid struggle of the town to the open solves the struggle of existence for them and further makes the opportunity somewhat too obviously for a display of much agricultural lore in an atmosphere the sweetness of which becomes cloying towards the end of the tale the narrative is written breezily throughout though the authors handling of the bellows has not been sufficiently masked he has perhaps more scorn for than sympathy with the pettiness with which he is obliged to endow many of his puppets in order that they may be true to life the individualism of socialists and the trickery by which even the wellintentioned are content to earn a living are after all but the natural concomitants of an environment in which the breadth of outlook is lacking to make  waste not want not a worldmaxim the tale which is essentially american may not appeal to all english readers but though the conditions vary in different lands the author has grasped the essential traits of humanity in its present stage of development and such understanding being a necessary preliminary to further advance any one who helps us to it deserves our thanks  the son of the wolf by jack london isbister 63 we notice in the advertisements of a god of his fathers a previous work of the authors appended to the present volume that a critic remarks it is no exaggeration to say that mr london does for the klondyke what mr rudyard kipling has done for india a reading of the son of the wolf leaves us with the conviction that mr rudyard kipling need be under no uneasiness mr jack londons tales are all  vigorous his men are all muscular heroes his language his style his situations all have the ideal and the downright virtues of muscularity so far so good but we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where mr jack london fails we do not wish to disparage in any way the son of the wolf the nine tales of which the book is made up are healthy breezy narratives of sensational incidents in the  worthland scruff mackenzie goes on the trail seeking a wife

melodramatic fashion the best story in the book is to the man on the trail because it is the least theatrical  in a far country  is a tale with the same motive as  an outpost of progress  by mr joseph conrad to compare the manner in which the two authors bring the same situation before us is to see why mr jack london cannot be called an artist he is a vigorous story teller for the general

lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight

household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective

forces stirring somewhere in the region of this nook of shelter and starlight and that the people who populate it are very fierce realities as a matter of fact the lunar paradise does not arrive until the real action of the book has ceased it is reserved as a kind of reward or escape after many strenuous chapters in which the struggle is not merely one of thew and sinew but a moral war with

dancing saloon and the faction fights of public holidays this abrupt plunge into a western world of slang and steam and strife is made palatable to english readers by the pride with which the hero and heroine contemplate their saxon origin but the author must not be accused merely of making an effort to conciliate his critics over here he brings out certain qualities in those two figures which we are glad to recognise as admirablethe more so that the woman is the deeper and more consistent character and has none of  billys weaknesses billy roberts like the book is mixed in his composition brought up as a prizefighter he qualifies as a teamster and handles horses with the same mercy and discretion wherewith he handled men he is certainly a  hunky  gladiator this sixfoot giant of the blue eyes and fair complexion but when poverty and hardships arrive he loses selfcontrol and shows once more that the physical training of the ring however thorough is no discipline for the finer issues of life  saxon his wife on the other hand keeps true to her simple ideals and brings him through her emotions are always fresh and womanly she succeeds in everything her modesty allows her to undertake but she cannot help the author to interest us in certain chapters which are only agricultural pamphlets in disguise this is the real defect of his book from the literary point of view the moral one is that in billys excesses the ethical balance is not sufficiently preserved otherwise we have nothing but admiration for this powerful and human story,juvenile

and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while

the little golden lady by c h bennett griffith  farran washed ashore or the tower of stormont bay by w h g kingston jackson walford  hodder three hundred sfsops feibles translated by the rev g f townsend routledge  sons the princess i late a fairy talc saunders otley co mrs s c halls latest publication is a very pretty and rather whimsical story about little peoplewe can hardly call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of sounder work and better art are several wellexecuted landscapes from drawings by messrs e m wimperis and w s coleman mr w j allen is a very happy contributor of vignettes and tailpieces bright thoughts for the little ones is a book for infants the novelty of which consistsso far as we see the notion is a new onein the fact that little pieces of verse are made to alternate and proceed from little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him the event of the scorpion that attacked skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds grim hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend jack there is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told the illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  washed a shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved from its violence one of these is a dashing midshi pman who tells a young laxlya very young ladythat man friday was notablackwhatever defoe might have written there is also a very good blind pedlar a hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers especially as a considerable amount of local colouring is applied to descriptions of southern islands and the manners of their inhabitants the discovery of the longlost son of the old seacaptain who lived in the ancient tower and the narrative of that sons adventures make up jjr a sort of robinson crusoe stry that is well worthy the attention of the readers for whom the book is written three hundred esops fables purports to be a newliteral translation from the greek the work of th rev george fyler townsend who supplied new applications morals c to an edition of croxaus old version which we not long since reviewed croxaus production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation the illustrations which are thu work of mr harrison weir are very unequal in quality some are good as the fawn and his mother the crow and the  pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures the worst of i the book as a whole is that their author has not  the slightest sense of the eopian humour here i as in other respects no one of modern times has i approached the happiness of thomas bewick in his old age the princess ilsee is a fairystory of which the producer of the book before us be she translator or author hus no mean opinion it begius i with an account of the deluge and dryingup of  the earth and gives a rather fantastical description of the process of the latter by the hands of angels with huge besoms made of the wind and enormous brushes composed of sunbeams ono of these angels being rather tired with the  cleaning up sits down on the top of a lofty mountainalpine teak  our writer styles it and meditates on the terrestrial and moral prospect before him much in the manner of a serious and highlyrespectable  young lady in a drawingroom this angel is spoken of as male his notions are those of neither one sex nor the other  which is orthodox no doubt although the effect on the reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has our peculiar abhorrence tried by its own standard there is however ample evidence of care and even of delicacy in writing on the authors part she has carried out her intentions with exactness neatness

the daisy chain or aspirations a family chronicle by the author of the  heir of reddy fie c london john w parker and son 1856 we heard of an ironical gentlemans addressing a young lady the other day after this fashion 44 so you are for the heir of redclyffe i divide young ladies into two species one who swear by the heir of redclyffe and the other by queechy was it not an exasperating speech ladies  and an insulting comparison many will add yet queechy has its beauties too  not the hushed and sweet pervading charm the perfect taste the innate elegance the refined beauty no nor even the passion and intense interest of the heir of redclyffe but a simple untamed natural beauty of its own it is emphatically protestant and perhaps what is called a little sectarian  rough too and outspoken at times it has an air of the wild woods and the back settlements about it the 44 heir of redclyffe is like a deep blue italian sky with a rich gorgeous passionate sunset queechy is more like an autumn heaven iii our cold climate with merry patches of sunlight bursting through the gloom and a cold sharp healthful wind abroad chasing the falling leaves yet these are but fantastic similes and only play about the truth like bees that hover round the blossoms without settling the 4heir of redclyffe  is out of all compare the higher and the deeper work artistically and morally its foundations are deeper laid and its parts are more thoroughly selfconsistent it yields evidence of a highly cultivated mind a genial spirit a kind and generous heart and a clear and powerful intellect so keen is the discrimination of character evinced and so sweetly and unobtrusively is it displayed we might rather match miss yonges creations with those of miss sewell also admirable of their kind her 44 katharine ashton being an especial favourite  we were sorry to find her fall so far beneath herself in her late 44 cleve hall but both these gentle and cheering lights may well shine on in their kindred spheres without having the relative brilliancy of their orbits too curiously investigated the star of the 4 heir of redclyffe  casts a wider and more brilliant ray but there is a chaste and holy influence in the beams of the sister planet but no more of this come we to the matter directly at issue the merits of the 44 daisychain this is a certainly lengthy family chronicle of some 600 closely printed pages with little or no plot and perhaps not much romantic interest and yet it has interested and edified us not a little there is little or no direct didactic teaching but a healthful atmosphere breathes through the whole there are a thousand wayside flowers though no gorgeous magnolia or other hothouse blossoms the dear mother so soon removed the enthusiastic gallant generous father the doctor and all the children become familiar to us as real acquaintances we do not think of them as of characters in a book but as of actual people respecting whom we are entitled to hold our own opinions sometimes not coinciding with those of the author norman is too proud and too fastidious to please us though he is a noble fellow after all henry is well nigh our favourite of the boys  richard is very good but a little of a bore  then for the girls ethel though certainly a good deal like miss bremers 44 petrea is like with a difference more learned and perhaps more earnest more english altogether margaret verifies the motto si douce est la margarine mary flora all are to the life whether we like or dislike them but how yield our readers an idea of the charm of this book by quotations that were impossible unless the quotations were very ample and our review exceedingly elaborate within such limits as we shall allot ourselves we can only say that reading the 44 daisychain  is something like taking a walk through a plain country which does not appear romantic at first sight in the early summer when every chance step discloses some new object of delight the wild flowers in the hedges the rich blossom of the may the gay and giddy butterflies the blue sky overhead with its white clouds scudding past the sun and the sense of living joy which animates creation this is not a book to read straight through or in a hurry you will not enjoy it then you are not hurried along by wild excitement as in miss brontes startling creations but young people will love the 44 daisy chain and so will many of their elders and we feel that we are bound to thank miss young for teaching us unselfishness simplicity and rectitude in such a very pleasant and unpretending way she has strung a wreath of daisies it is true but they are daisies that will not wither  the daisy chain  or aspirations a family chronicle by the author of the heir of i redclyffe c parker  son the links of the daisy chain are eleven young children living in a country town with kind parents and a happy english home each daisy is the complete child of nature yet has its own individuality which is preserved throughout and each character speaks so naturally for itself that the reader seems to be one of the  chain and sitting in family conclave round the hearth the book must be taken up with a determination to enter into home feelings for story there is none the contrast between the children and their various  aspirations form the only incidents that verge on excitement so that the feelings must be interested alone by the truthfulness and simplicity of the family chronicle so many young heroes and heroines with their instructors give the author of the heir of redclyffe and  heartsease ample opportunities for exercising her peculiar genius for minute sketches of character but we must warn her that when carried into too minute ramifications it will be apt to be pronounced  finicking no better idea can be given of the story than by quoting the daisies mothers description of them which certainly will interest those the most who have daisies of their own  you say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies and if i do not write in these leisure days you will hardly get it after i am in the midst of business again the new daisy is like margaret at the same agemay she continue like her  pretty creature she eau hardly be more charming than nt present aubrey the moonfaced is far from reconciled to his deposition from babyhood he is a sober solemn gentleman backward in talking and with such a will of his own as will want much watching very different from blanche who is flora over again perhaps prettier and more fairylike unless this is only ones admiration for the buds of the present season none of thtm has ever been so winning as this little maid who even attracts dr hoxton himself and obtains sugarplums and kisses bather she than i says harrybut notice is notice to the white mayflower and there is my anxittyi am afraid it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to gi t a rebuff i hope having a younger sister and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary flora soon left off thinking about her beauty and the fit of vanity does less harm at five than fifteen my poor tom has not such a happy life as blanche he is often in trouble at lessons and bullied by harry at play in spite of his champion mary  and yet i cannot interfere for it is good for him to have all this preparatory teazing before he goes into school he hus good abilities but not much perseverance or energy and i must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his schooldays begin in hopes of instilling them the girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys i suppose harry is too kind and generous to do more than tease him moderately and norman will see that it does not go too far lt is a common saying that tom and mary made a mistake that he is the girl and she the boy for she isa rough merry creaturethe noisiest in the house always skirmishing with harry in defence of tom and yet devoted to him and wanting to do everything lie does those two harry and mary are exactly alike except for harrys curly mane of lioncoloured wig   so much for the younger bairns whom you never beheld dear flora the three whom you left when people used to waste pity on me for their being all babies together now look as if any pair of them were twins for norman is the tallest almost outgrowing his strength and ethels sharp face so like her papas makes her look older than flora norman and ethel do indeed take after their papa more than any of the others and are much alike there is the same brilliant cleverness the same strong feeling not easy of demonstration though impetuous in action but poor ethels old foibles her harumscarum nature quick temper uncouth manners and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object have kept her back and caused her much discomfort yet i sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a discipline that is the best thing for the character in the end they are fuults that show themselves and which one can tell how to deal with and i have full confidence that she has the principle within her that will conquer them   your sweet goddaughter flora i almost feel as if i had spoken in disparagement of her but i meant no such thing dear girl it would be hard to find a fault in her since the childish love of admiration was subdued she is so solid and bteady as to be very valuable with the younger ones and is fast growing so lovely that i wish you could behold her i do not see any vanity but there lies my dread not of beautyvanity but that she will find temptation in the being everywhere liked and sought after death stops the writers hand and by being left early motherless and unwatched the various characters of the children quickly develop themselves though nipped by miss winter the governess who is  sharp and then unrestrained by her successor who is  soft and  has feelings of the contrasts constantly brought out perhaps the most striking is that between the two elder girls and their  aspirations though it is difficult to separate any part of a chain so linked together ethel tall awkward and enthusiastic  was obliged to set to work so many principles to induce herself to wipe a pen or to sit straight on her chair that it was like winding up a steamengine to thread a needle  yet the work was done shewas struggling with her faultshumbled by them watching them overcoming them flora quiet blueeyed and selfcontrolled meanwhile was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the unexpected services she had rendered confident that her character for energy and excellence was established believing it herself and looking back on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long past and conquered she thought her grownup character had begun and was too secure to examine it closely ethels hope and aim in life is to civilise the wild denizens of a neighbouring slate quarry to form a school and perhaps build a church flora strains hard throughout her life  to serve two masters  and by her marriage with a neighbouring squire mr rivers who gets into parliament and transplants her to park lane she has ample opportunities of carrying on the struggle  mrs rivers is an admirable woman  so every one felt and her youthful beauty and success in the fashionable world made her qualities as a wife and mistress of

interpreted the christmas carol  since john l eech illustrated it on its first appearance but we have no hesitation in saying that miss appletons eight paintings are worthy to rank beside the best of those illustrations by her many predecessors she is not much concerned with the humour the grotesquerie of the story but we doubt if the poetry the grace the tenderness and fantasy of dickens were ever more delicately or more sympathetically depicted than they are in her drawings her scrooge should have been a little grimmer a little harder of feature perhaps but her tiny tim and bob cratchit and the rest of his family are delightfully natural and human she is very successful too in dealing with the eerie ghostly elements of the narrative her wintery nights have the hue and atmosphere of winter and the spirits that haunt them are veritable things of mist and bodiless we congratulate both artist and publishers on this beautifully illustrated and tastefully produced edition of the best

someone has aptly said of dickens  he is a portrayer of living souls rather than of living men it is here that the secret of the great novelist is found to read a christmas carol with a responsive mind is to be brought into rapport with the essential spirit of humanity and to be awakened to the true meaning of fellowship with the world especially the struggling heroic and kindly portion of it

and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while

william thought he could speak without being heard he informed mr monteith heiad learned that an order for his removal had been given and that in two days he feared he would lie taken from stirling on his way to england to be tried af carlisle  that he had discovered that colonel monteith had had interest enough to be allowed to detain the children under the pretence of taking care of them and that strict orders had been given to the governor of the castle not to salier them or mrs monleitli to cpiit the prison till after his reuval  but my dear good master continued william seeing mr monteith

you must remain till i return from edinbiugh  and then xve may bc able to contrive some method of getting vou on board of a ship and out of the country as quickly as possible  mr monteith shook his

risking and you may depend on finding me ready at the hour you have mimed to attempt to put the plan in execution  william endeavoured to persuade his master to attempt his own deliverance but mr monteith felt convinced that instant death must be the consequence if he did so and the fear of adding to his poor xvi fes sufferings by making her a witness to such a dreadful catastrophe weighed against all the arguments his faithful servant could urge and when the jailor summoned wiliam from the presence of his master he xva fenced to leave the prison without having the slightest hope of

began to prepare the children though the agony she endured both from parting xvith them for the lirt time in her life aud from the danger he could not help seeing they ran in eae of any unforeseen accident happening to tlu rope during tiieir descent rendered her scarcely able to complete her task mr monteith xvas not much more composed himself as he lirnily believed whauxer might be his success
