the mountain lovers let us regard fiona macleods  pharais and the mountain lovers as expepments and this not merely in concession to our halting and wavering judgments the initiator of a movement is entitled to latitude over and above that which the success achieved may entitle these particular books have something in them which must attract certain temperaments and which as certainly will repel others let the experimenters honour at least be claimed for fiona macleod untempered praise is comfortless let  the mountain lovers by fiona macleod 3s 6d john lane us be content to be interested to be charmed very often and to wait for more it may be for fiona m4cleod we are waiting it may be for some one else we have been waiting l6ng taking the books at their lowest estimate then as experiments they are attempts to reveal the heart of a foreign country within our owqi shores a tract lying across the scottish border in which mr barrie and mr crockett are aliens as much as are the dwellers in the south a country of a different language and of a different accent and vocabulary when it uses its neighbours tongue to a large extent of a different religion different ideas different and fewer aptitudes a country in which since bardic days poetry has expressed itself but seldom in written words the home of a people at once highly poetical and unliterary tourists with a turn for fiction have travestied their speech and character immediate neighbours between whom and themselves even in these peaceful days there is a tacid feud have found in them endless materials for jokes their histgry and legend have been told over and over again by appreciative outsiders but seldon with the native flavour their poetry is lost or antranslated or dishonouredby vague and mawkish english words their music given to the winds to keep the winds that made it scott the lorderer skirted the country and poet that he was in a chapter or two a character or two more especially in a song or two

the rest the celtic scot or more correctlyfor this is no mere question of race and the cqlts are everywhere but of environment history and local ircupstancethe scottish highlander is unknown still till he travels and amalgamates and leavens the race he mates with he is not altogether to be read in his more articulate irish brother he has a mind and character widely diqering from his welsh and breton cousins though all the family records concern him the notable attempt made by macpherson in the last century had its ludicrous sides which help to explain some of the ridicule it excited in the literary england ruled by the prejudices as well as the povers of dr bjohnson and though the bardengehriill it gave rise to in germany was sometimes foolish yet ossian sham and real was to goethe an inspiration its spirit  travelled throughout europe with a speed and force that almost stamp ourlater poetrysave byronsas insular by contrast ie modem poetry of nature owes it an unpayable debt and to every celtic heart the ossian rhapsodies have a reality the talent or the ambition to expresshimself has been hitherto much lacking in the highlander and perhaps poetry would be the fqrm most natural to hin but fiorxa macleod has made the attempt in a kind of poetic fiction she attempts perhaps luckily little in the way of plot or circurastaice of tin1e more definite than this the tragic end of  anqbal gilchrist the doom that had fulfilled itself for torcall cameroq what was either but apiece with the passing of the ancient lapguage though none wished it to go with the exile of the sons though they would fain and live and die where their fathers wooed their mothers with the coming of strangers and strange ways and a new bewildering deathcold spirit that had no respect for the green graves and jeered at anciept things and the wisdom of the oldstrangers whom none had sought none wished and whose coming meant the going of even the few hillfolk who prospered in the machar the fertile meadows and pastures along the mountain bases the ancient language has been passing long the sons began to wander long ago any time from the 45 to the touristridden present would serve as date and the story would fit any age two young lovers separated bythe feuds of their houses two old ones by the hate bred by loye wronged and distorted and the irresponsible influence on their lives of a child and a dwarf with q halfdeveloped mindthere is little more in it the dwarfs search for his soul the childs pranks and elfin singing lovemaking birth peaceful and tragic death such are the human contents of the tale which has less interest as a story than as the fulfilment of an intention the incidents apd characters are there to mark a spirit the spirit of a humanity that ha needed no luxurious epoch little intellectual or priestly training to purify its soul that in its best instances save under strong excitements is tepder mild religious and poetici and living in near and sensitive intimacy with nature so at lea in  the mountain lovers does fiona macleod read the flighiand character an4 genius with greater power i think than in pharais the strongest of all the celtic passions the love for tarth and sky may exist without much firsthand observation of nature may be expressed bx rhapsie that could not be disentangled into the components of their inspiration but fiona macleod does not run this danger her first of al has she attained to genuine power one thing save noted with doubt it is more a query than a criticism in my mind theft is a note ir her writing which sounds particularly modernthe cry of the wo for her burden is this a celtic revival or merely a rather incongruous boroing from present discontents this descent of the scandinavian pirate on the isles is however an interesting if iphamonious disturbance of the spirit of both booksit appeared in  pharais too her story qo more purposeo to reveal the whole character of the highland celt than does  hermann and dorothea for instance purpose to summarise the telqton it breathes merely of their poetical sense and their affectiocs and the writer is not to blame if a susceptible southern reader go in vain search of oona and alan and sorcba in his autumn holiday and find only persons of very diferenit patter the highlapderof today as of yesterday has such threads in his character and for the purposes of pastoral poetry and of fairytale they are fitting besides forming an effective contrast to the shrewdness the sternness the hard energy of the scot portrayed in popular lowland fiction i do not moan over what she has omitted many and many a page has charmed me she hos led the way and in further developments the music of the strathspey may mingle with the lovesong and the coromach we may catch glimpses of a more whole and varied highlander than she has given usboth wild and mild humorous and morose  gentle and fanatic enthusiast and pagan fiddler dreamer and dancer demonstrative

the siege of florence an historical romance by daniel mcarthy ksq  vols colhurn in the notice of mrs gores  dowager we took occasion to call the attention of our readers to the present state of literature iu its moro popular departments and to its intimate connexion with certain particulars in the actual phasis of societya truth as we conceive of primary importance and hitherto much overlooked of these particulars the most remarkable perhaps is the increased demand for books and a consequent rapidity of intellectual productions among the many influences exerted by this cause there is one suiliciently obviousami that is a proportionate exhaustion affecting at  once the imagination of though author and the exi citability of the public it is not that the comi binations of nature or of society when measured  against human power are practically less than i infinite or that under any circumstances newfields would be waining to the operations of genius imt then it is genius alone that can  discover them md genius is not to be cleated at pleasure by a mere demand for its exercise when hoxvever inventive genius docs arise and it has extorted from society an approbation for its novelties they are seized upon forthwith by a host of innovators the forms are multiplied and the beauties frittered away in endless repetitions each for the most part differing from its predecessor only in thc inferiority of its execution the nexv form is no sooner recognized than it is worn to a thread  or if in a few splendid and exceptional cases superior p o xve rs  of combination are manifested they are still  manifested to a disadvantage for the public satiated with the overwrought model responds  not to the stimulus and receive with indilleri euee excellencies which formerly would have obtained signal success this forms a state of things equally irksome to both parties and both endeavour to escape from it through channels unfavourable to thc best interests of literaturethat is through an abandonment of simplicity and truth and the search after monstrous excitements from the most illegitimate sources there is on the part of the public a demand for what may bc termed a literary draindrinking and on the part of authors and cf publishers there is not wanting it corresponding eagerness to work thc illegal still and to serve the hot and poisonous product as much above proof as the strength if their alembic will admit it is the curse of all vicious excitement to provoke a desire for perpetually increasing stimuli and in the search after the means of gratifying this desire authors are bent on outdoing at all risks the former outdoiugs of their predecessors one writer labours to make his murders more niurdcrnti hi desperadoes more desperate his embroglios more embroiled and his moving accidents by flood and field more moving more unexpected and more impossible to all such series however there is a necessary term  the spring on which they are destined to act loses its elasticity and exaggeration defeats its own end nor is this term placed at any very remote distance others therefore abandoning the substance seek only to exaggerate the forms and throw themselves for ellect on the production of some absurd novelty of style such are the germanisms of recent introduction quaintnesses or a gorgeousness and a stilted elevation of expression which is neither prose nor verse but a condensed essence of the defects of both forcibly feeble and pompously inane and these affectations arc brought to bear upon worncut and cllote themes as the tinselled trappings of a theatrical wardrobe are sometimes employed to conceal thc mean and distorted figure of a wouldbe stage adonis others again place their hopes of success upon ultrarefinements of psychological speculation on outrageous passions extravagant motives and unnatural designsthat is on the creation of moral monsters in despair of succeeding xvitli mere men and

fictitious narrative is concerned by the moral changes going forward on thc surface of society itself putting aside the historical or the antiquarian novel every such work is intended to realise and represent some passing form of society richardson ridding smollett lnchhald and though modem fashionable novelists have all nlikc attempted at least to copy after some definite nature a part therefore of their relative excellencies must depend on the value ol the specific nature they have been employed to copy just as may be observed in thc comparison ol the dutch and italian masters hut one d the most striking characteristics of progressing civilization is an increasing smoothness of the surfaces of society a gradual merging of the individual in the common characteristics of the masses the protection of laws comparatively equal and relatively welladministered while il dispenses with much personal selfassertion assigns to the individual lines of conduct xvhich it becomes neither necessary nor lawful to pav fadiion too usurps a wider nnd a more tyrannical sway  and thc animal while it is thus rendered more servile becomes also less demonstrative to this cause may be assigned that access ol hypocrisy now more frequently adopted to hide hom society as far as possible all deviations hum though prescribed standard that more rigorous reign of the decencies of life and the growing timidity in authors in their dibits to reproduce the realities which heave and glow beneath these studied appearances the concurrence of all these various influences has occasioned the tendency which we have noticed in fictitious narrative to arrange itself round two opposite poles a pole of lelinenient displayed in frivolities and superficialities in all that is conventional in society  and a pole of cynicism to which the seekers after the intense gravitate in their dibit to excite emotion by the representation ol the exceptional the violent and all that society rejects from its bosom of the animal or the moral man there is also another tendency of civilization most influential on modern literature which must not be omittednamely its disposition to advance though positive at though expense ofthe ideal modern critics have falsely explained this by the prevalence of the much reproached philosophy of though eighteenth century by the scepticism of though metaphysicians and the dovilopeineiit given to the positive sciences by though followers of bacon this philosophy was not au accident but ene among many clleets anding directly out of the intimate nature of man and the law of hid progressive developeinent intellectually j though imagination and the judgement are antagonist faculties and the one receives iiicrcaed activity somewhat at the expense of the oilier in the

corresponding changes in ibo literature of dillions as they advance in their course epic and religious poetry lyric poetry decrip ive poetryhistory eloquence metaphysics art morals didactic prose

down and afterwards comedy while horses and wild animals luurp their place on the stage exactly as it happened in a similar condition of civilization in home to excite thc blunted imagination by stronger stimulants is as we have seen a hopeless attempt  and another source of interest has been recently sought by a class of writers xvho have bent fiction from its legitimate end amusement to

  his natural life his natural life by marcus clarke london bentley and son  those of us who have been in newgate as artemus ward said may possibly tingle with a sinister glee of remembered horror as they pass from abuse to abomination recorded in this book but in its own words  no ordinary men leading ordinary lives can form any notion of such a life as this hideous with realistic ghastlinessesnauseous with detail of barbaric torturings scarcely relieved by any touch of tenderness it reiterates a nightmare of iniquities to the end the deportation of convicts to tasmania and elsewhere from these islands has happily ceased the abuses of that obsolete system are contained in minutes and bluebooks of which a tempting array is given at the end of the story it is ostensibly to prevent the extremely improbable return of a similar failure that an extract of all its choicest outrages is here served np as a threevolumed novel it is a work of much power but more horror the hero condemned for a robbery which he did not commit and on which he is heroically silent to conceal his fathers crime and his mothers shame for twenty years suffers unspeakable agonies as a convict is always escaping is always thrown back into a deeper abyss has always some fresh ingenuity of physical or moral torment invented for his benefit then thrown in for divertissement we have a rechauffee of the tichborne conspiracy an incipient adultery floggings to death sundry suicides for very loathing of life and hero and there a climax of cannibalism the story opens with a passion which culminates in the family tragedy and though invective by the way is powerful throughout the defoelike minuteness of the genealogy is surely unnecessary though scenes on board though convictship aro drawn with a strong hand but how is the authors purpose or how is the development of his characters served by his detailed descrip tion of two mutinies  they would have been more at home in some book of hairbreadth stories for boys so too of his homeric single combats and his description of  the bestial boohoo kept up between decks and the hideous phantasmagoria in the evilswelling twilight and the hideous commonwealth whose only order of nobility is the halter all this is very vivid and is held up for our execration and very justly too but after all why kick a dead dog  from the convictship the llydaspes is seen on fire it explodes and in it is supposed to perish richard devine the preconvict name of rufus dawes the hero for such a belief dawes to conceal his sacrifice had created in a letter to his mother he and his bastard halfbrother john rex dawes by the way is a bastard too and does not know of his relationship to rex and frere his cousin an officer are all of course on board the convict ship and all ignorant of each others personality and we find them together again and again still always thrown together as the sufferer and the plotter and the bully after some years of agony at macquarie harboura cheerful place bounded by foetid exhalations and the seaand when the settlement is being moved elsewhere there is another mutiny which is this time successful frere and the wife and daughter of captain vickers and one or two others are landed by the convicts and left to starve but dawes who had previously been exiled to a desert rock for insubordination and had drowned himself once but rescued by an accidental log had wandered away in search of settlements till death had stared him in the facereturning in despair to  hells gates finds the convicts gone but the outcasts starving and he builds them a marvellous coracle of goatskins stretched over logs having caught his goats with springs and salt and what wronder  for  he could fell trees without an axe bake bread without an oven and build a waterproof hut without bricks or mortar and so he becomes their preserver and even the bully frere yields a surly deference to genius and after ten days at sea and of course just as the cruse of oil is on the point of failing they are picked up and frere gives up daws as a runaway and himself usurps the credit of their preservation and mrs vickers dies and on sylvia the child a blank forgetfulness of just that crisis falls and the other two men who might have told had killed each other and so daws is not believed but his last state becomes worse than the first then as the years go round sylvia is married to her supposed preserver frere from gratitude and not for love and ho and she and daws are always being brought fruitlessly into contact and frere is always breaking dawes spirit or someones spirit by fifty or a hundred lashes administered to daws or by dawes with details of weals and groans after the original horror in  uncle toms cabin and so on till the blood boils ten convicts wander off and ultimately eat each other and that for several pages north a drunken parson but a very good fellow appears on the scene as a friend of daws and sylvia but he ends by running off with the latter to sea only that dawes by changing clothes with him forestalls him and so in universal shipwreck the curtain falls meanwhile john rex who had escaped had imposed on the heros mother by his likeness to her son and had lived in splendour till after betraying himself he only survives as an idiot it is a sickening and desolate story all thc crimes of a system are crowded on to the head of one innocent man just as a missionary magazine will concentrate with pentecostal plenty all the concessions effected by the finance of twenty years into a pennyworth plum of touching narrative the plea for the book is that these effete abuses are in fact in course of reconstruction in new caledonia  and no doubt for we have chapter and verse all its horrors are authentic but why send them round in three volumes and in un elegant cover to startle boardingschool young ladies and fire the molluscous imagination of novel readers with auttsdafv on paper and all the tortures of nero  those who sup on horrors know where to go and those who take any useful interest in convicts are more likely to be reached by other means than these the author of his natural life might write a capital book of adventure byfield and flood  or he might acquaint himself with the latest accounts of khiva and tashkend and expand in narrative veracious and vamberesque or he might outboucicault melodramatic tragedy orand herein is another bone to be picked with himlie might write a really good novel of character drawing for his incidents on ordinary life and avoiding the ghastly and the curdling improbabilities  escapes in bluefire down a bottomless precipice unravelable family mysteries a finale only attainable by a universal massacre ti la hamlet are the stock tools of ordinary sensational novelists the author of  his natural life shows us by hints and glimpses that he is capable of better things hia characters though their development is overcrowded with incident contain elements of a power that would well repay practice dawes a brutalised prometheus is simply an incarnation of suffering  but frere the goth who develops by unrestrained exercise of power into the ruthless tyrant and who slowly but surely chokes his springs of good is a character touched in the description by many delicate suggestions he is as it were a teutonic and ruffianly tito his patronising air with the child sylvia and his blank incomprehension of her when she is his wife and his clumsy passion for such unwonted purity are all finely touched sarah parfoy the wife of john rex and mistress of frere is a hard and unwholesome subject but truthfully drawn  she was the sort of girl of whom women say it is a pity she has no mother and men it is a pity she does not get a husband and who say to themselves when shall i have a lover   mr meekin as the apotheosis of a canting parson is perhaps overdrawn  but in the description of north the drunkard there is a vivid power and the crown of the story is sylvia delightful as a queer and irrepressible child and well if far too slightly touched as a loving and unsatisfied woman her childish sayings are many and all good though drawing a little too much on the belief of a reader with average experience of children  will danny wear his yellow jacket in heaven or go as a free man   and it is the one touching trait in the martyr dawes when through all his misery he worships the memory of the child whom he believes to be dead we shall look for another work of the same author either on gorillahunting and maneating or a pleasant and wellelaborated study of character he has it in his power to give us either but we should like to know which it is to be the present story is neither nor

she had often played before and xvent out into the wood and in the middle of the wood there xvas a bright cool brook and by the side of this she sat herself doxvn threxv the ball up into the air and caught it again  and this xvas to her as a pastime but it happened once xvhen the ball had floxxn very high and the princess lifted up her arm and stretched out her lingers that she might catch it that the ball fell upon the ground by the side of her and rolled staightxvays into the xvater the princess xvas frightened and looked after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy jewels thy pearls even thy golden crown itself are nothing to me  but if thou wilt take me for thy friend and companion set me on  we have not ottered an opinion on that part ol mr bulwers work which treats ol literature haviptt reserved hi views on thc subject sui a second notice thy right hand at thy little tallie j let nie eat with thee out of thy little golden dish drink with thee out of thy little cup and sleep in thy little bed i will get thee thy golden ball again how the princess thought in her heart  how this silly frog prattles  a frog is no companion for such as me hut must remain in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all her might j against it saying  now you xviii have rest enough you

the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear out of the chapter of curses so

do you never grow rusty  asked the axe  not with over work replied the saw  and indeed i have alwvays found that constant employment best preserves our polish which after all is only artificial you are quite a philosopher not exactly so for i sometimes do grow exceedingly hot and lose my temper and what says your master why he generously desists awhile and i soon grow cool again and then i cut away like a razor through a piece of mottled soap i  you are a happy fellow said the axe  how differently am i situated mty master is a chopping boy with a thick block which is tantamount to saying he is a fat fool he is very sharp with me sometimes and when he finds i am inclined to be blunt he grinds me most cruelly  alas i cried the saw it s the way of the world my friend for i have invariably remarked that the rich always grind the poor for the sake of the  chips bravo  exclaimed the axe you see i ve not lived in the world all this time without getting a notch or two said the saw  nor i

do not give you any trouble at any rate  i axe your pardon old boy remonstrated the axe  for although i do not complain of my teeth exactly my chops give me a pretty considerable deal of trouble i can

love should be extinguished by the inundation i tarried on my way to purchase a macintosh  ah you have always some excuse for your conduct cried his lady  the other night you were detained at the club  and did you not then blame me for having soaked my clay too much it was that very rebuke toadalinda that induced me on this rainy night to make this purchase that i might not again be in the same condition  youre a rogue and you re a beauty  said the lover as he imprinted a kiss upon her lips done do  cried toadalinda i 11 tell my ma see if i dont 2 u  and i m quite sure your ma will not

candlestick said to the new saucepan for few can shake a toe better than your devoted and you my beloved are perfect in the figure in more senses than one but come along  the appeased and delighted toadalinda put her arm within her lovers while he held an expanded toadstool over her head to shelter her from the drizzling rain and away they trotted to the scene of festivity without waiting to partake of any refreshment for as the lover jocosely expressed himself they were sure of a little wet upon the road   the old ledger the old ledger by g l m strauss in 3 vols tinsley brothers when a critic has been pleased to speak of a work as  the very worst attempt at a novel that has ever been perpetrated we may reasonably expect to find something inordinately bad on the other hand if we discover that we have placed too implicit a confidence in this very excathedra statement we shall not err in visiting an unmerited sentence of condemnation with considerable severity again a production which has been alleged to be little more than a display of bad latin bad french bad german and bad english cannot well be supposed if we pay credit to the words of the selfconstituted judge to come from any other than a grossly illiterate author if however this assertion should be proved to be as groundless as the first it will stand in need of still stronger censure and for this reason  excellence in mere fiction is to a great extent matter of opinion quot homines tot sententice a novel which one critic may pronounce admirable will possibly appear to be little pleasing to another  the imaginative taste is modified and changed by education and association but when the knowledge of the writer has been impugned when he has been charged with grammatical incorrectness pervading several languages  when in fact he is told that not only is his intellect vicious but that he is in ignorance of the proper way of constructing a sentence the matter is altogether changed if what has been affirmed is not true and just then the socalled critic has deserted his peculiar sphere and has condescended to have recourse to rancorous abuse the barrier between criticism and libel may be slender but it must there fore be the more diligently observed those who most strongly uphold the liberty of the press are precisely those who must be most vigilant in seeing that journalism never oversteps its limit the amount of trust accorded to reviews is at the present day immense it is not too much to say that current literary opinion is almost wholly formed by them consequently the injury that is done when organs so powerful for evil or for good are wilfully perverted is simply incalculable  and the more unqualified and positive their unjustly unfavourable judgement may be the more pernicious their effects will certainly prove the novel which has been the subject of the foregoing remarks  the old ledger has met with peculiarly harsh treatment from a contemporary whose name we need hardly mention and that the work is not without faults many of them grave ones we are far from wishing to deny in the first place the j development of the plot and of the characters j is essentially unnatural the heroes and  heroines converse in a manner which is too often artificial melodramatic and forced dr strauss has thus been content to sacrifice one  of the great sources of interestaccurate de j lineation of character in its stead he has j trusted to striking and rather fantastic inci i dents the world which he describes is not j the world of today nor is it that of fifty j years ago  and his actors are such as could surely never have been found among our con j temporaries or our ancestors touches of j nature of course there are to be met with at j intervals throughout the book and sometimes  sufficiently brilliant but the old ledger  j wants the attraction that can only spring j from a carefully elaborated account of j human action and human motives its j brightness is that of the wintery sun utterly j void of genial warmth  it is one of those j fictions which may be read with great interest once but whose second or third perusal will pall upon the mind dr strauss will not plunge sufficiently soon in medias res he keeps his reader standing on the threshold for a long and weary while ere he will permit him to enter the veiled hall he is not allowed to make the acquaintance of sir richard ellesdee without being introduced to his grandfather his greatgrandfather and other personages who have but little interest except for inquirers into family annals and framers of genealogical trees in a similar manner he is not permitted to form his own impression of a house rich in antique curiosities and paintings but is presented with a catalogue in which its contents are enumerated with a conscientious fullness and accuracy worthy of the illustrious robins all this is very fatiguing  and it is rendered even more so by the frequent use which the author makes of italics  than the constant repetition of these nothing can be more wearying to the eye or mind underlined words or expressions are only pardonable in the letters of very young ladies  an author should make it sufficiently obvious where the main emphasis is to fall by the mere construction of his sentences thus we find  then did there not perchancewho shall tell i for who knoweth  c and  an exuberant philanthropy with this awkward qualification that she loved man rather than mankind and men better than man besides a host of other passages equally objectionable the mere english composition of  the old ledger is in the main extremely good  the style is nervous pointed and vigorous occasionally dr strauss is a great deal too diffuse and spends a superfluity of words upon one idea  but his work contains many very striking bits this is good masculine writing  no platform philanthropist henot one of those crosses between sham religion and sham charity the great admired of the hall who head subscription lists with decoy donations and delight in sprinkling their dilute benevolence over some patent vast redhot misery that the hiss may be heard and the steam seen to attract attention to their noble deeds and to their noble selves  but one who would delight in solacing some secret sorrow and effectually relieving some occult individual misery  and who would keep both hands employed in the congenial work that the left might have no leisure to inquire into the doings of the right of the advisability of introducing into a fictitious group of characters real personages who have been disinterred for this express purpose in the manner in which dr strauss avails himself of the usage we are not quite sure however the question is one of no serious importance occasionally quaintnesses are of too constant occurrence   however so is a favourite idiom of the authors again colloquial expressions or expressions which are even still more familiar are too plentiful but of the gramme matical error whatever the language in question may be which has been imputed to the old ledger there is absolutely none many of the scenes are admirably wrought up and the descriptive ability displayed is considerable the outbreak of a fire on board a ship at sea is an old theme but dr strauss has managed it well the picture which he has given of a duel is graphic and contains some of his best touches of character  while throughout the whole of the third volume the interest is various and well sustained it is in his reflections that we like dr strauss the least they are often entirely irrelevant to the theme and digressions unless some colour of an excuse exists are peculiarly objectionable even thought can be stimulated in the reader at too great an expense we dislike also the gossiping tone which is sometimes assumed  and the circuitous method which is occasionally adopted of putting the reader in harmony with the writers sentiments and convictions the old ledger possesses the undoubted merit of containing a large quantity of interesting information which sufficiently proves that the author is not only a man of literary tastes but considerable literary acquirements with reference to this subject we should advise dr strauss to be more careful on all future occasions in the correction of his proofsheets the number of misprints which have been overlooked is quite surprising  while in vol ii page 65 occurs an extraordinary misquotation of a line and ahalf from virgil such that while the sense remains intact the laws of prosody are completely violated defects of this nature are highly culpable through reason of the carelessness which they display  though beyond this they argue nothing  the old ledger  gives evidence of a clever and a thoughtful mind it is exceedingly unequal in point of meritnow brilliant and now heavy at one time we get glimpses of the touch of a master at another we almost see the crudities of a tyro we could also wish more than once that dr strauss had indulged in condemnation a little less roundly and with more reserve it is of course just as well to call a spade by its most simple name  but as novelreaders generally adhere to conventional forms of expression it may be as well to avail oneself of conventional language we have pointed out frankly and plainly what we regard as the chief defects in  the old ledger and we have done so because we feel sure that when its author has amended these he may produce a very admirable work of fiction and one whose popularity will be in proportion to its merit his present production shows great power  nis language is forcible  his imagination is vivid  and his descriptions are full of energy and spirit he has a keen sense of humour and the sketch of dr jolibois the prattler of polyglot is very happy but dr strauss work has other recommendations besides these the moral which it conveys is unexceptionable  the old ledger itself is  a ponderous old book solidly bound in vellum with elaboratelychased heavy solid gold corners and clasps containing an inscription and an avowal of the principles which are to guide successive generations of the house of ellesdee in their banking transactions to this each representative of the family is in turn required to affix his name with a solemn oath that he will obey all the injunctions which are there laid down  that he will allow  no temptation however so luringno danger however so threatening no consideration of self or others however so powerful and urgentto make him swerve from that straight path of honour and integrity it is only when this solemn oath is broken that the fortunes of the eilesdees begin to decline the existence and influence of this timehonoured ancestral volume is well managed and the main events of the narrative are skilfully represented as depending upon the faithful observance of its vows as a whole we are pleased with dr strauss work  and we do not doubt that at some future and we hope not distant time we shall be able to bestow upon him less qualified eulogy,history_contra

  miss marjoribankh wm blackwood  sons sir w scotts dictum on writing is well worth consideration if you would desire to be read with interest you must first of all perfectly comprehend yourself what you are about to say one of the great charms and there are many in the description of miss majorifoanks selfdevoting career is this perfect conception of the character it would not appear at first sight to be a very eligible thought for a novel to represent the ambition of a schoolgirl to foecome the leader of society in a provincial town  but so admirably is the keeping of the character preserved so brilliant are the touches which represent the accessory figures that we do not hesitate to say that we have found much pleasure in following the clever and yet after all unselfish manoeuvring of miss marjoribanks and have read the book with thorough enjoyment there are other charms as we have before stated in the history of miss majoribanks triumphs among these are unexpected strokes of pathos all the more telling from the way in which they are suffered merely to drop into their right places without being continually reminded of the attack on our sensibility for this reason our feelings are more truly moved the simplicity of the narrative that art which conceals art is particularly noticeable in many novels we are kept at boiling point so long that almost all our emotions are blown off before we can venture on another trip with the author here the ability of the narrator retains our interest almost without effort to the end whatever the characters say has meaning we are a little weary of the pages which fill up  many a modern book and are offered as samples of everyday conversation over needlework and suchlike occupations the effect of which is to make us long for the hut in some vast solitude talent does not mean the power of merely copying nature but of making a picture the style of writing is very good with much real wit and plenty of imagination the personages introduced are not caricatures but fair embodiments of actual existences above all the author does not pretend to inculcate this or that class of opinion  but is content to show us a chapter of real life and then permits us to draw our own inferences ours is that we have been exceedingly well entertained and are now anxious to peruse another story from the same brain we must confess until we finished the tale which came out in parts in blackwoods magazine that we were a little irritated like dear old mrs chiley with lucilia marjoribanks neglect of her own interests but the denouement has quite reconciled us  it is so very just and yet pathetic that rough clumsy cousin tom should carry off the prize at last and it also shows what we commenced by stating that the chief personage had been very carefully studied before she was pourtrayed it was as she says to be tom after all miss marjoribanks mission is to be the comfort of her papa who is a widower a doctor in carlingford a borough town the doctor who does not relish the notion of being deprived of the pleasures of a otmbachelors life staves off his difficulty by keeping lucilia three years longer at school after her return from a tour in italy c miss m fairly takes possession of her fathers house and commences her great mission  she holds thursday evenings and by means of her own talents and drawing people together is very successful she organises society but is continually exposed to very serious hazards by the awkward conduct of many of her subjects it is in managing these apparent catastrophes that lucilia rises beyond herself several candidates for her hand who are more struck by her mental superiority than by her charms are drafted oft to other persons this is the whole plot but so much knowledge of the world is shown so varied are the dispositions delineated so easy is the style so pregnant with truth that we become intenselyinterested partisans of the queen of carlingford the conversations are full of purpose and ali tend to one endto heighten the difficulties to be managed and to display the skill of the general we rather suspect that the author has secured the privilege of passing into other peoples heads and reading their thoughts only we doubt whether the same advantages would be the result as now  for simple and natural as the tale is it has been carefully developed to the end by a very superior mind,history_contra

smith elder and co  manxy times has the observation been made in these columns when the novels of mr jam1es have passed with intervals of only three or four months between each in rapid succession under the notice of the reviewer that he writes too much and too fast more than once have we feared that his fancy had been fairly exhaustedthat imagination had been drained to the dregs and never again would he rise to the height of his first great efforts when he was striving to achieve a reputation and which had been manifestly flagging since that fame was wvon and profit became the stimulus to writing glad are we therefore to be enabled to say of him that those fears were awakened too hastily by the appearance of three or four features that seemed to be evidence of an exhausted mind and what marvel if it were so the only wonder will be that it was otherwise a novel every quarter a volume a month twelve volumes a year surely this is not to compose but to manufacture scott was deemed a prodigy of proluctiveness but scott fairly wrote himself out mr james beats scott hollow in the race of the pen and who could be surprised that he fell lame or that his friends should hasten to

a better world  to deny either the possibility or the probability of its tenants becoming palpable to mortal sight in certain states of the body when the soul is partially severed from its tenement of clay and perceives existences through other than the gross media of the bodily senses mr jamies has for the purposes of this romance carefully studied the legends connected with the rhine and introduced them most skilfully and effectively having resolved to write a real romance he laas wisely abandoned himself to his purpose and given the rein to his imagination perhaps too he has borrowed something from the radcliffe school whom he rivals in the elements of wonder caverns and dungeons ghosts and prophecies and dreams and murders and bandits and the machinery of the minerva press but employed with more skill and a greater regard for probabilities altogether this romance is the best which its author has produced for a long time it will revive the flagging interest in his productions and prove very popular at the libraries we will not mar the pleasure of our readers in the perusal by anticipation of the plot enough to advise them to put it upon their lists of books to

has helped us to skin his lord and so it is all fair for us to skin him a peal of laughter from his followers succeeded to this remarkably just and honourable observation of the baron of eppenfeid in

the making of a marchioness new novels by frances hodgson burnett smith elder  co we have here the struggle for lifeor wellnigh for lifeof a povertystricken but wellborn girl alone in london the case is no uncommon one nor happily is the courageous high spirit to meet it emily foxseton much to her own surprise a marchioness preserves in spite of daily anxieties a natural joyousness and trust which are the basis of her character the author writes with some care for detail and probability yet this very care now and again suggests that all is not taken sur le vif the lady reader who knows what straightened gentility really means may note small discrepancies it is easy to see that comely wholesome emily is a persona gratissima with her author before lord walderhurst comes into her life  to stay the account of how the girl for at thirtyfour she is a girl manages to keep up an appearance bordering on smartness on twenty pounds a year supplemented of course by daily toil is quite a study she makes herself generally useful to and liked by ladies who want their shopping choosing of servants and other things done by proxy all these and other things she does with neatness and dispatch her qualities are not what one expects from the usual heroine of fiction but one grows interested in her works and ways and even her skirts in spite of some unnecessary repetitions the fresh and friendly ways of the  creature as some of her patrons call her appeal to them as they do to us and she is in much request when to her own utter surprise and intense gratitude she becomes lady walderhurst she retains her simple and kindly habits but she does not at once live happily ever afterwards   she is made to undergo many and great dangers we cannot say much in praise of the way this part of her story is unfolded perhaps however the authors numerous admirers will not be hypercritical but will enjoy her story without analysing it  the making of a marchioness dv frances hiodson burnett bs smith elder on the whole the first part of this novel is better than the second in the first you are introduced to emily foxseaton a simple lovable womanly heroine of thirtysix a dependent ladycompanion in great houses who finds an unselfish happiness in promoting the happiness of others and so engaged unconsciously wins the affection of the mature widowed marquis of walderhurst and after a short matteroffact wooing becomes the marchioness the second part is equally good until the marquis has to go abroad then captain osborne heirpresumptive of the marquis who is staying near by with his wife in a house his lordship has lent them is invited to come with his household and become the nlarchionesss guests for a while and under her roof they are better able to carry out diverse diabolical attempts on her life the captains desperation increasing when he learns she is expecting an heir he wants to teach her horseriding intending to arrange a throw for her but she declines aided by his indian servant he deposits a broken cornice on the stairs on the chance of her falling over it saws through the rail of a wooden bridge on which she often leans to watch sunsets poisons her glass of milk but she is saved by her faithful maid and the repentance of the captains wife and fleeing for safety goes into hiding in london the characterisation is so consistently true in the case of emily and the marquis and his cousin lady maria to say nothing of minor persons that one resents the intrusion of this melodramatic captain with his stagey outfit of bluefire villanies and resents it the more because after he has departed to india the story closes with a return to its earlier natural note and the winning of the nmarchioness back from the gates of death is a pathetic and human touch that makes the preceding sensationalism the more unreal withal the book is so eminently interesting that however much you may disbelieve its sensational developments you will not be able to lay it down till you get to the end  notes on novels thfse notes mt the weeks fiction are not necessarilyjinal reviews of a selectin vyill jollow thk ma kim ok a maunnoxkss by frances hodson burnett a pleasant sympathetic story of modern life the scene is laid in an english country house where a marquis is the centre of matrimonial interest on the part of both the knglish and americans present

for her and to cause her to break into her goodnatured childlike smile smith elder os  the making of a marchioness by frances hodgson burnett smith elder 6s mks burnett has not done herself justice in this book melodrama is all very well in its own place but out of its placethat is in a novelit demands very special treatment excellent work has been done before now by placing real human characters in melodramatic situations or less often and with greater skill by placing melodramatic characters in real human situations dickens did the former over and over again  mr meredith bus occasionally and very happily done the latter now thc author of thc making vf a marchioness has done neither she has quite frankly placed melodramatic people in melodramatic situations and the result as a novel is not convincing we have a poor hardworking virtuous and rather stupid heroineit is impossible of course in a melodrama to ally virtue with the smallest smattering of brainsand we have a rich handsome virtuous and rather stupid hero who is naturally a marquis and marries the heroine we have come across that taciturn but noble and deeplyfeeling englishman so often that we really begin to think he must exist further as all true melodrama demands we have the villain who would have succeeded to the title if the marquis had not married again and the villains wife who is dark and gipsylike and clenches her thin hands at every opportunity and in the background is the smart lady who says the smart things it is scarcely necessary to mention that the comic relief is maintained in the usual way by the faithful servingmaid and the faithful servingmaids mother every one of these people no doubt exists in a world that is made up of all sorts just as the plots which are laid against the life of the marchioness might with perfect possibility le laid against the life of any real marchioness who is in the way butand this is the pointit is the novelists business to select and mrs burnett has selected neither characters nor incidents fairly the complexity of life which the novelist unlike the playwright has every opportunity of presenting is scarcely suggested in the making of a marchioness and the author gives away her point of view in the sentence  the scene lietween the three was fair too subtle to be of the least use upon the stage but it was a good scene nevertheless now that unwritten scene would probably have done for the book what all the unconvincing incidents in it have failed in doing perhaps it is her descent to melodrama that has made mrs burnett unusually careless of her style  appalling  is a good word but is scarcely applicable to a change of fashion in skirts page 1 honest drops of tears page 270 may be an elizabethan construction but is scarcely

belforest a tale of english country life new novels  by the author of mary powell c 2 vols bentley few writers have a better oyo than the author of  mary powell for discerning all that is picturesque in domestic ufo there are no characters perhaps in  belforest that may not be met with in our everyday experienceno incidents that would be considered very extraordinary even in the quiet circles of a country village but the figures are carefully drawn and the grouping is skilfully managed so that every portion of the picture is effective although it is composed of homely materials the author has evidently bestowed a good deal of thought on artistic subjects and she carries out with her pen the principles that she would recommend to those who work with the brush and palette her first rule we should imagine is to go to nature for models her second to select from among natural objects those which are pleasing and reject those which are rough and coarse her third to make an harmonious arrangement of the various tints and to throw a genial warmth over the whole there are many other kinds of art besides this but this is by no means a bad kind moreover it is essentially womanly and ladylike womanly because it is gentle and unassuming and does not aspire to heroics and ladylike because it is always refined and disdains to borrow  humours from the stable and pothouse the scene of  belforest is laid in a retired village untainted with suburban innovations but near enough to london to be within a walk of the dulwich gallery here wo find a young artist leonard antony lodging at the village postoffice and sketching everything in the neighbourhood whether living or inanimate nessy saffery the postmasters little daughterwho is esteemed a young lady of property on the strength of possessing an annuity of thirty poundsaspires to be initiated into the mysteries of art and it is ludicrous to contemplate the horror of the london zeuxis when asked to give lessons to the child of a village grocer nor is it less amusing to behold the blank dismay of miss saffery when leonard antony persuaded at last to undertake the charge sets her to draw straight lines on a piece of inillbuard though pour child has been fondly imagining that she is to start with a grund subject and a bright glow of colouring that she is to commence at once on a glorious work of art such as that on which mr antony himself is engaged the sudden fall to something little better than pothooks is terrible and nessys irrepressible anger nearly creates a fatal breach between the singular allies this quarrel between the clever and sarcastic young man and the demure little girl of thirteen makes a very amusing scene and it ends in a compromisemiss saffery being permitted to handle the brush a little while she graciously consents to use the chalk and millboard a good deal in avery short time she makes rapid progress the village magnates purchase her rustic sketches and even her instructor nods approval from his lofty pedestal however she is not intended to be a painterat least not in the present work perhaps the author intends to give us a continuation as nessy is not yet married or even in love and there are one or two other threads that might be taken up but  belforest has its own share of the romance of life apart from nessy several of the characters have a comic vein and the dialogue often causes a hearty laugh without ever becoming vulgar  mcndvleigh a tale of enrlisi country life cy the author of the ladies of beaver hollow 2 vols bentley meadowleigh is a tale with a mild pleasant interest of its own a refined and gentle spirit pervades it which 13 as refreshing as a breath of country air after the heated atmosphere  of ambitious sensation novels the story would have gained by compressionit is too sketchy and the interest is weakened by the action of the most important point of the tale being detailed in  long letters instead of being put into action there is

who enjoys living with miss clairvaux and well she may for  their life at the three parks is a tempting picture of elegant thrift and rural comfort meadowleigh is a good picture of a retired quiet and rather dull english village and the style of society is well described miss clairvaux does a great deal  of good after her own fashion but she battles with overseers and disputes about her taxes in a i fashion which affords a pretext for a grasping 1 relative to bring forward a charge of insanity in order to get her fortune into his own administration during the temporary absence of eleanor she is spirited away to a lunatic asylum but no one knows where the search for her the discover and the liberation make the main plot of the tale which though light agreeable reading might have been made

the metropolis by upton sinclair arnold upton sinclair has here turned his attention to the bizarre and morbid effects of wealth upon society in newyork his new novel is a study in extravagance which might have proceeded from a disciple of zola the hero is a lawyer who goes to new york with his mother and pretty cousin and is introduced into the fashionable world by a younger brother whose livelihood seems to be gained as a toady social pilot and tout for the first 168 pages of a novel containing 342 pages the lawyer does nothing but look on on p 177 however he receives a retaining fee of 50000 dollars in an insurance case which is smothered by mammon before it comes into court when he finds that he has merely served the purpose of enabling a rogue to get something for himself out of other rogues he is disgusted and announces his intention of seeking some way in new york for a man to earn an honest living the strength of the novel is in its picturesqueness luxury is presented grandiosely as in hotels which obligingly reduce the rental of a suite of rooms to 600 dollars a week horribly as in operawraps of  unborn lamb   and funnily as in a rich ladys refusal to use twocent stamps on account of their colour there are several clever sketches of character but more exercise of imagination might have removed a certain stodginess in the book,history_contra

the attacking party and between us and the wall lay a tiny lake some fifteen yards across half as many in depth and about twice as many in length it was formed by the flowing of the sea into a natural chasm left by the cliff as it fell and we could distinctly hear the gentle gurgling of thc water to our right reverberattug ailong through the tortuous passage which communicated with the occam thus supplying this little reservoir with water without allowing its calmness to be affected by the swell without the sun shining down over the rocks which completely surrounded this little loch lit up its white and shining bed in a manner truly beautiful to behold while the depth of the water seemingly even greater than it was added a lovely tinge of blue beautifully contrasted with the vivid hues of the orangecoloured starfish which clinging to the rocks beneath dotted ait intervals the distant bottom in one or two plaices the wild and stunted shrubs grew down close to the waterline and thc shadows of a couple of young ash trees were seen playing on its sparkling surface the passage across was by a very slippery causeway not more than a foot broad at the widest and formed by thc edges of some ponderous fragments of the cliff which had faheu across the pool almost in its centre altogether it was one of the loveliest little spots that i think i ever beheld and thus suddenly brought

divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and

  count hannibal by stanley j wey man smith elder  co  count hannibal  is the best of mr weymans novels that we have seen for some time perhaps it is that he has inspired himself with a little of dumass fire by taking his subject from the time of the reine margot series one of the two great ones whatever be the cause the book is rapid is absorbing and the hero is a distinctly interesting character in himself apart from his deeds of daring the chief criticism we should make on this example of mr weymans work is that he does not seem convinced enough of himself or sufficiently sure of not boring his public to venture on the magnificent insistence on detail which delights one in dumas take for example though scene of the midnight attack on tavannes in the inn  the idea is excellent but the effect is disappointing because the whole scene is too hurried if we might venture to make a suggestion we would point out how vastly the excitement of the account would have been increased if the toilsome passage of the conspirators through the underground passage had been dwelled upon if their fears of discovery the feelings of the man left below while the others were parleying above and their subsequent capturelike rats in a trap had been described as it is the reader is not allowed long enough to luxuriate in the terrors of the scene,history_contra
vikram and the vampire or tales ot hindu devilrv adapted by sir r f burton edited by isabel burton memorial edition illustrated by e griset tylston and edwards sir richard burtons selection from the baitalpachisi is one of the strangest of fairy story books this old legend contained the germ of the  arabian nights and suggested both matter and form to such later collections of tales as the  decameron and apuleius  golden ass fantastic all of them gruesome many of them full of strange witty inventions their very grotesqueness fascinates while their applicability to modem times fills one with wondering mr grisets illustrations are altogether in keeping with the text sir richard burton translated freely he acknowledges  to remedy the conciseness of their language and certainly he gave them an attractive form  vikram and the vampire or tales of hindu devilry  adapted by richard f burton frgs c london  longmans green and co 1870 christmas is the time to welcome old friends with new faces but it is a question whether mr burtons adaptation of the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a vampire which first appeared in fraser should not rather be described as an attempt not altogether welladvised to pour the new wine of western criticism and humour into the old bottle of oriental invention w7ith the exception of a few modern and altogether foolish jokes such as  i love my love with an s because hes stupid and not psychological which do not harmonise with the ingenious paraphrases of hindu eloquence the book is decidedly amusing there are no weird horrors like those in the story of grettir and glam and the vampire himself is a goodtempered and rather engaging demon who executes the will of fate by slipping through raja vikrams fingers and having to be recaptured every time the raja is seduced into giving an opinion on the merits of one of the true stories which he relates in succession these are of varying interest and complexity the worst being the only one literally translated  but in the others it is easy to distinguish by internal evidence the modern gloss from the original framework of the tale the episode of the apple of life in the introduction is one of those which found their way from oriental collections into the gesta romanortttn and the vampires third story contains the rudiments of the favourite german character der getreue johannes the fifth story which recalls portions of the forty thieves suffers from the editors attempt to give the modern equivalent for the lingo of the hindu scripture chanriyavidya or thieves manual the best illustration belongs to the seventh story and represents a quadrupedfrankenstein a supernatural tiger destroying the wagners who created him  but it is one of the incongruities of style before complained of to make the guru  a physiologicophilosophicopsychologicomaterialist a jayasthalian who had become convinced  that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself the problem which finally poses king vikram is to find the relationship between the children of a father and son who have married a daughter and mother but this is introduced by a pseudoprophetic description of the white outcasts who will one day conquer india which is not much better than is common to this hackneyed form of satire the chief use of the volume besides dispelling unpleasant associations with the name of vampire will be to familiarise the run of readers with hindu methods of thought and expression and to show the tie of aryan brotherhood strong through all superficial discrepancies m octave feuillet could not improve upon  no one knows the ways of woman  she kills her husband and becomes a sati suttee  and the proverb  hauta pandit sansara alas the world is learned  breathes a depth of spiritual exhaustion such as we are apt to fancy peculiar to later ages h lawrenny  vikram awl the vampire or taits of hindu de vii ry adapted by richard f burton with illustrations longmans  co it is somewhat strange that the indian tales entitled  the twentyfive stories of baital and the thirtytwo stories of the throne have not become better known in europe the baital pacbisi and singhasan battlsf such are their indian names are household words in hindustan they truly reflect the customs and superstitions of the hindus and they contain some poetical touches and a great deal of capital horror of the monk lewis and der freischutz school sometimes there is an approach to pathos as in the story of the rajput family who devoted themselves for raja rupsen their chief excellence however is in the description of lonely cemeteries and incantationscenes which latter are quite equal to that where the wild huntsman of the hartz mountains makes his appearance capt burton therefore has a theme of some promise in its peculiar way and he is the man to make the most of it but it is time to explain the meaning of baital pachii vetiilab in sanskrit is a sprite or goblin haunting cemeteries and inhabiting dead bodies in hindi the word is baital such a being is the narrator of the twentyfive tales which have become one of the popular storybooks of india and the way he is brought on the stage is as follows  the father of vikram king of ujjain a city in central india has incurred the resentment of one of those hindu saints who seem never to be aroused from their heavenly meditations except to deliver an anathema on their fellow men gandharbasena vikrams father is cursed by the saint and dies and the saint then plots the destruction of vikram he is the more confirmed in his design as it so happens that vikram who is the indian king arthur was born at the same astrological period as the saint as was a third individual the son of an oilman who in some way we are not told how but probably by penance obtains though sovereignty of the infernal regions and fate has decreed that whichever of the three can murder the other two will become a universal monarch the saint who by the by is the son of a potter murders the oilman and suspends his corpse in a cemetery head downwards from a tree where it becomes the abode of a baital or demon the saint then comes to vikram in the shape of a handsome young merchant presents the king with rubies of inestimable value and asks him to attend a sacrifice which he is about to make to durga the goddess of carnage intending when vikram prostrates himself before the goddess to strike off his head vikram however has been warned of the treacherous design by a giant whom he had defeated in single combat he goes to the sacrifice with his son and is told by the ascetic to bring the oilmans corpse from the cemetery where it hangs in spite of horrible apparitions which are sent to deter him vikram cuts down the corpse when the demon who inhabits it tells him he will consent to go with him only on condition of his not speaking he then tells the king as he is carrying him twentyfive tales and at the end of each puts a question so artfully that vikram is twentyfour times betrayed into answering whereupon the corpse slips from his grasp and resumes its hanging posture in the tree at last when the twentyfifth story is told vikram maintains silence and the demon now instructs him when he is commanded by the saint to prostrate himself to request his holiness to show him how to do so and to strike off the head of the ascetic as soon as he bends baitiil then departs from the corpse which vikram carries to the saint whom he decapitates as directed capt burton has selected the first second third fourth sixth ninth tenth thirteenth fourteenth twentyfirst and twentyfifth stories and of these he has translated the tenth literally and the rest freely his eighth story which corresponds to the twentyfirst of the hindi is largely supplemented and there is among the insertions an excellent account of hindu philosophy capt burton makes no mention in his preface of a former translation of the  baital pachisi by mr burckhard barker which was edited by mr eastwick in 1855 we will only further observe with regard to the note at page 36 that persia is one of the countries in which a hog is stabled with horses to avert calamity from them at page 41 we suppose witches should be read for bears as da in is the word in the original and this at page 70 is properly

martineau in 3 vols vol i 12mo pp 22 london 1845 mozon m1iss martineau informs us in her preface that a change in the game laws being inevitable it was considered by some of her friends that such change might be more easily and safely accomplished  if a clear knowledge of the operation of the present system on all the parties concerned were more general than it is found to be and it was at their instigation that she was induced to give her aid towards the advancement of that object by means of the instrument which he had before wielded so effectivelydidactic fiction hence the idea of the series of tales the first volume of which now lies before us miu martineam has selected three epochs of our history for her illustrations of the game lawe and their practical effect upon the population among whom they prevail this first volume is devoted to the old forest laws of canute and those still more stringent enacted by the norman kings and which endured until swept away by the torrent of public indignation in the revolution of 1640 the forthcoming volumes are to illustrate the operation of the milder system that prevailed from the revolution of 1688 to the change of the law in 1831  and an exposition of the working of the existing svstem as it affects all the parties related to it the first tale is entitled ii nmerdhin and is intended to show the nature and operation of the forest law forced upon the saxons by their danish conquerors the second named  the manor and the eyrie is laid in the times of the early norman kings the third  the staunch and their work descending somewhat later exhibits the ultimate effects of those harsh laws upon the happiness of the people and the fourth which closes the volume and is entited  old land marks and old laws traces the still more remote consequences to the point where endurance had been carried to the utmost and humanity was about to rise in rebellion against intolerable oppression as a literary production independently of their political purposes these tales are in all respects worthy of the past fame of the authoress like her other works of the same class they have an interest as fictions perfectly apart from the lessons they are designed to teach indeed so excellent are the nar ratives that we are apt to forget the moral intended to be taught in the absorbing attraction of the story whether the reader will draw for himself the conclusions designed to be impressed upon him is a problem that might admit of doubt but there will be no question as to the great ability with which miss martineau has accomplished her task nor that this new series of didactic fictions will command a popularity scarcely less than that enjoyed by its predecessors whatever the readers individual opinions upon the subject to which they are devoted he cannot fail to reap both instruction and amusement from the perusal of these forest and game law tales which may be safely ordered by all bookclubs and even placed

the place fixed on as their asylum hence this state has eve to the present day assumed a rigidity in its religious character which distinguishes ft from the rest of the union the time to which this novel relates is soon after the first establishment of the colony and when it was extending to massachusetts and thus laying the foundation of a powerful republic the heroine of the tale is a miriam 3 rey the daughter of a rigid puritan and the hero who of course is her lover is a alajor atherton who although not a saint or even a puritan respects the religious feelings an1 opinions of those with whoin he comes in contact without following the author through his conventiclemeetings religious conversations or war with the pequod indians all of which are well describedwe may state that the conclusion is the marriage of the lovers this work gives an admirable picture of the manners and religious customs of the newe nglanders in the infancy of the colony there are also many interesting incidents in the story which however are not very easily detached and if we give an extract it is rather to show the authors style than to afford any idea of the interest of the story in the incursion

culinary preparation she started wvith surprise as her unexpected guests entered the apartment and stood a morment surveying them attentively anad with an air of gentleness and pity rather than of curiosity miriam on her part regarded the indian female with involuntary admiration she had scarcely passed the season of youth and her mature and noble figure at once dignified and graceful possessed that vigour and elasticity so peculiar to the natives of the forest while her regular features her soft and intelligent countenance expressed a mind susceptible of elevated sentiments and a heart warmed by the gentlest affections of her sex cushnminaw cautiously drew a mat over the aperture through which they entered and advancing close to his adopted mother with very earnest gesticulation entered into conversation with her when they had finished speaking the wife of mononotto approached the captives and taking a hand of each in her own she saiddo not fear white daughters aiioma will care for you she will speak to alononotto that no harm come nigh you  miriam encouraged by the voice of kindness clasped her hands energetically and replied in a tone of entreatyi if you have pity for us entreat that we may be sent back to our home and friends we will speak for you said cushrlinaw it may be my father will listen to our oice grateful for this unexpected favour miriam attempted to reply but her spirits were weakened by fatigue and misery and for the first time during that anxious day of captivity her tears flowed abundantly and prevented her utterance aliomna seemed grieved by her distressi  she spread a soft new mat gently urged her to sit down and wthen she began to smile through her tears expressed her delight by patting her cheeks and stroking the hair from her forehead and appeared greatly to admire her beauty  cusliminaw soon after left the wigrwamn and mxioma perceiving her captives were faint for want of nourishment hastened to setbefore them a portion of the

earthen pipkin withi n instrumlenlts for catiug but the hands and i was altogether so repuqniwtint to their appetites that thley could with difficulty swalliow a few kernels of corn to satisfy the calls of nature mlionia in the mean time busied herself in arranging an apartment for her guests for though a wigrwam seldom contained mere than one room for the accominodation of a wyhole family she knew it was not agreeable to the custeoms of the white people and a native delicacy tautht hlr to consult the feelingrs of those who were cast on her hospitality 11er simple arrangements were soon

they continued their sportive gambols till called away by the voice of their mother miriam trembled at the idea of encounterincg the haughty amononotto but after listening attentively and hearing only the children and miomna singing to herpappoose she ventured to leave her room and join them rachel refreshed by sleep almost forgot her late alarms and too youn i to realise the perils of her situation with the simplicity ot her happy age she believed herself perfectly secure while in the presence of mliriam mioma received them kindly anl set before them a repast similar to that of the preceding evening with the addition of a cake of pounded corn dried by the fire which they found rather more palatable she spoke english imperfectly but endeavoured to encourage them with the hopes of release and to assure them they were in no iminediate danger several days passed away without any important occurrence mlononotto spent most of his time in hunting and fishing and when in the wigvamii

  the whips of time by arabella kenealy john long  the question of heredity versus environment is miss kenealys themea problem which even in fiction requires for its elucidation a more delicate medium than the good old device of changing two infants at nurse yet the result is an interesting and on the whole original story we certainly find little of that subtle analysis of character for which the subject presents peculiar opportunities for the most convincing person in the bookthe beautiful demimondaine with her romantic surroundings and essentially prosaic nature stands more or less apart from the main issue the authors taste for melodrama is throughout conspicuous but her peculiar theory with regard to athletic women has assumed a milder and more reasonable form in construction there is a marked advance upon her earlier novels,history_contra

mary of iiuriundy or thc revolt of ghent hy the author of  darnley  richelieu  henry 3iasterton acc a vols ljino london 1 llia longman and co wi cannot hesitate in calling this decidedly the very best romance that mr james has produced the mystery and the interest are alike well sustained and the principal character delineated with a degree of dramatic power that i marks those happier creations of the author which stand out from the common run of fictitious heroes albert maurice the young burgher is a noble conception well filled up and in good keeping with the time when the demarcations of society were so broadly drawn and yet oftentimes so suddenly reversed the period too is one of much attraction the low countries have been our european nurseries of commerce and liberty they were the first to break up the foundations of that great feudal system which growing at first out of the necessity for protection which the distracted state of kuroio made necessary in the turbulence of its early darkness became afterwards so intolerably oppressive when peace had its claim as well as war trade brought wealth which was power and brought still morea habit of enterprise men saw the necessity of protection for their gains  hence arose certain rights and privileges wrung first from the weakness of some ruler who looked not beyond the present often revoked and often infringed yet the precedent once established became an authority for war freedom soon took a more extended view and out of those civic immunities and commercial protections grew those ideas of mans unalienable rights now so well understood and so generally insisted upon these volumes present a most animated picture of the period with its tumults and troubles its forests swarming with freebooters its nobles still looking upon themselves as earths savon red ones its burghers growing every day mure conscious of their importance  and the one or two of highertoned minds who inspired by patriotism planned more important schemes for the benefit of their own native lands and towns such are the materials which have been wrought out with animation worthy of those stirring days while the repose of so sweet and gentle a being as mary of burgundy is in excellent relief to the darker shadows of the picture the ensuing passages may show with what grace the embellishments are thrown in wc shall only premise that albert maurice is the young burgher on whose talent and influence with his fellowcitizens most ol the story turns 4 livery one knows that in the early dawn j of a sicilian morning the shepherds and the watchers on the coast ofthe messinese strait i will sometimes behold in the midst ofthe clear 1 unclouded blue of the sky a splendid hut de lusivu pageant which is seen also though in a j less vivid form amongst the hebrides towels i and castles domes and palaces festivals and i processions arrayed annies and contending hosts pass for a few minutes in brilliant con fusion before the eyes of the beholders and then fade away as if the scenes of another i world for some especial purpose conjured up for a moment and then withdrawn for ever from their sight thus there are times too i iii the life of man when the spirit excited hy some great and stirring passion or hy mingling with mighty and portentous events seems to gain for a brief instant a confused but magnificent view of splendid things not yet in being imagination in the one case and hope in the other give form aud distinctness to the airy images though both are too soon doomed to fade away amidst the colder realities of the stern world we dwell in the mind of albert maurice had been excited by the scenes lie hat just gone through  and success without making him nrrogant had filled him full of hope mach step that he took forward seemed but to raise him higher and each effort of an enemy to crush him seemed without any exertion of his own but to clear the way before him such thoughts were mingling with other feelings  brought forth by the sight and the roice and the smile of mary of burgundy when the sudden call to her presence woke him from ouch dreams but woke him only to show to his minds eye a thousand confused but bright and splendid images as gay as glittering as pageantlike but as unreal also as the airy vision which hangs in the morning light over the sicilian seas fancy at once called up every thing within thu wide range of possibility battles and victories and triumphant success the shout of nations and of worlds the sceptre the palace and the throne with a thousand indistinct ideas of mighty things danced before his eyes for a moment with a sweeter and brighter image too as the object and end of ambition the reward of mighty endeavour the crowning hoon of infinite success but still he felt and knew even while he dreamed that it was all unreal and as he followed the messenger with a puck pace though vision faded and left him but the cold and naked truth at length after passing through several chambers which flanked thc hall of audience the door of a small apartment called the bower was thrown open and the young burgher stood once more before mary of burgundy lue of the most painful curses of high station is that of seldom if ever being alone of having no moment except those intended for repose in which to commune with ones own heart without the oppression of some human eye watching the emotions of the mind as they act upon the body and keeping sentinel over the hearts index  the face mary of burgundy was not alone though as much alone as those of her station usually are  she stood near ja window at the other side ofthe apartment with her soft rounded arm and delicate hand j twined in those of one of her fair attendants  alice of imbercourton whom she leaned slightly while the lord of imbercourt himself stood beside her on the other hand and with his stately head somewhat bent seemed with all due reverence to give her counsel upon some private matter of importance how beautifully the next landscape is blended with human associations   lt was towards that period of the year which the french call the short summer of st martin from the fact of a few lingering bright days of sunshiny sweetness breaking in upon the autumn as a memorial of the warmer season gone before the sky was full of light and the air full of heat and the grand masses of high grey clouds that occasionally floated over the sun were hailed gladly for their soft cool shadow although the day was the eleventh of november sweeping over the prospect like the mighty but indistinct images of great things and splendid purposes that sometimes cross a powerful but imaginative mind the shadows of thc clouds moved slow over hill aud dale field and forest noss they cast large masses of the woods into dark and gloomy shade and left the rising grounds around to stand forth in light and sparkling brightness giving no bad image of the dark memories that are iu every heart surrounded but not effaced by afterjoys noss they floated soft upon the mountains spreading an airy purple over each dell and cavity while pouring into the midst of the valley the bright orb of day lighted up

clouded landscape he is likewise a little too fond of painting scenery and describing  dresses and we could lind other faults hut were his faults doubled they are more than atoned for by his beauties

fiction the voice of the people by ellen glasgow heinemann 6s phases of an inferior planet was a clever book and this book is both clever and very ambitiousas every novel must be ambitious which pretends to embrace the whole life of a man from the cradle to the grave the fault of the voice of the people is that it is too long we do not mean that its length is excessive in any absolute sense nor that the author digresses unduly from the theme which she has set herself nor do we mean that the book is dull it never is dull we mean that much of it is unimportant and inessential in the pretty and diverting scenes of white and black life at sleepy kingsborough the home of nick burr that born lawyer and politician and state governor this triviality of observation is especially felt it has a weakening effect on the story as a whole the original projective force of an author is strictly limited by nature and if the author tries to spread that force over too large an area the result must be in a measure to render it futile miss glasgows faculty of observation needs discipline it is too busy too fussy and a great deal too fancifulfanciful where it should be imaginative she often does not observe the right kind of thing she trifles and gives rein to mere fancy and gradually she passes into a condition a mood which without conscious intent twists and contorts life into something untruthfully erettysomething emasculate and feebly emotional when er hero and heroine approach the passionate climax of their lives this is what occurs according to miss glasgow then by a curious emotional phenomenon she seemed to be suddenly invested with the glory of the sunset the goldenrod burned at her feet and on her bosom and her fervent blood leapt to her face the next moment he staggered like a man blinded by too much light  the fieldtwith eugenia rising in its midst flamed before his eyes and he put out his hand like one in pain  what is it p  she asked quickly and nor voioe seemed a part of the general radiance  you have been looking at the sun it hurts my eyes  no he answered steadily  i was looking at you she thrilled as he spoke and brought her eyes to the level of his then she would have looked away but his gaze held her and she made a sudden movement of alarm a swift tremor to escape she held the sheaf of goldenrod t her bosom and above it her eyes shone her breath came quickly between her parted lips all her changeful beauty was startled into life  genia he sid softly so softly that he seemed speaking to himself  genia   this may be truth but it is truth falsified scarcely recognisable beneath its envelope of fanciful and quasimaudlin  intensity we insist on this aspect of miss glasgows novel because it is characteristic of much modern fiction the writers of such fiction should undergo a course of balzac in many respects the voice of the people is admirable the style is generally distinguished and the dialogue though too plentiful is lifelike and effective the sketches of negro character are excellent miss glasgow has a wide knowledge of life and manners the novel seems to be her true vocation and one is bound to accord to her that serious consideration which is only accorded to a serious artist  the voice of the people by ellen glasgow a story of american life by the author of phases of an inferior planet we watch the heros career from farmers boy to judge  there arnt nothin in peanutraisin  is nick burrs early conviction he accounted a judges career  cleaner work the story is a strong commentary on the lynching practises which are the disgrace of certain states of america heinemann 6s   the voice of the people by ellen glas gow heinemann 1 the voice of the people  is by a comparatively new writer the trend and matter of the actual story are not of any particularly notable nor distinctive kind they deal with the career of an ambitious highsouled rustic a boy who from nothing reaches a position of importance in his native state the hopes despairs successes and failures and other vicissitudes that meet him on his path are described with some vividness but there is more than this to attract the reader and more especially those with a liking for tales of the southern american states these latter are a happy hunting ground for clever novelists across the atlantic since  the open question and a book by mrs burnett we do not remember any story with so fine a southern setting and background for character as this where it is not plot and incident it is a series of bright soft pictures of nature itself of luxuriant gardens and of people instinct with droll or lovable peculiarities the life of the old virginian landowners the negro servants their quaint ways their outspoken freedom of speech yet exceeding loyalty to marse this or mis that are individually as well as traditionally excellent one feels the genuine human nature of old general battle who keeps open house of a ruined and ruinous kind also the sister who takes the reins of government and the charming little daughter auntverbeny uncle ish delphy and her meek soninlaw mose are also admirable so is the household of judge bassett and so in another way are the hardworking family of the ambitious poorwhite  hero the farmstead and the harsh yet kind stepmother and her chronic neuralgy all these persons places and things are excellent because beneath the impressionist touch of miss glasgow there is a solid hold on average human nature we perceive this in many matters in the relations between the general and his daughter and in a sense of an underlying unforced pathos in passing people and inanimate objects around them the group of happy irresponsible children is charmingly drawn then there are the sayings and doings of the black people often comical to a high degree indeed uncle ish his dignified almost injured attitude towards the kind human ravens who supply his daily bread is most amusing the story is divided into books we prefer the earlier parts but the interest is on the whole well maintained  the voice of the people bv elen glamow 6s heinemann the north may have the greatest output of

can be felt in  the voice of the people a sleepy old virginian town groups of oldworld characters quaint and individual but with their idiosyncrasies softened and toned by highbred courtesy and by a sunny clime are described in a very leisurely fashion we linger willingly among them miss glasgow is a writer of exceptional power she knows human nature and while here she dwells by preference among the more amiable specimens of it she does not shirk sterner realities indeed the story of her central character is so full of pain that we somewhat resent her inexorable treatment of him at least we resent her indulgent feelings to eugenia the prosperous young woman who wounded nicholas sorely married his rival and took his tragic death a little too placidly in the end among these comfortable charming folks the personality and career of nicholas have an added pathos the hardused struggler with the strong will the clear brain the inexorable conscience and the heart that is always unsatisfied is a hero after a real pattern made living and near to us by miss glasgows power of so much interest indeed that when he falls killed in a sorry scuffle defending a rascal we think it almost well life not being inclined to give him much delight virginia with its slow sleepy ways its chivalrous instincts its cautious venturing into the world of progressand its finemannered

the country curate by the rev g m gleig alias tihe author of the subaltern c 2 vols 12nmo 183othere are few men more capable of making the most of a short tale or a single incident than the writer befire us whether  author of the subaltern or rev g 31 gleig libentius audit he has no taste for any thing but sketches either because he has no patience for details or no tact for discussing perplexities or no confidence of powers for making them attractive and therefore wisely shuns the attempt he observes closely and what he observes he paints distinctlyperhaps too distinctlywith too hard an outline he has the art of giving more intensity to small matters than fairly belongs to them and thus occasionally raises a sort of factitious interest which rather excites for the moment than satisfies on reflection there is no possibility of blending poverty and sentiment dirt and delicacy misery and fastidiousness to any useful purpose mr g sighs over fine feelings where they are not likely to exist the country curate consists of nine or ten sketches three of which are reprinted from blackwoods clever and amusing miscellanythey embrace the curates own story and some extraordinary facts which fall under his own eye during his official ministrations the curates tale is a melancholy onean early death precipitated by the ruin of the fond hopes of felicity with a lovely girl herself the victim of hope deferred operating upon a consumptive constitution the sketches also are all of the graver cast and tell of misfortunes the results of oppressions or indiscretions or unbridled passionsof course not equally fitted for commanding the feelings of sympathy though with one exception this is obviously the authors purpose all of them have an air of life and reality about them the tale of the poacher particularly so his hut upon the mloor and the scenery around are described some will say with the pencil of an artist and others not unjustly with the pen of a surveyor it is too minute miss mitford would have produced an equal effect with half the words the poaclhers case is no common one and is with few exceptions matter of fact and it had need be from the gravity of the tone which the author takes in relating it he is not prompted to poaching by idleness but driven by necessityto feed his familly he is no dealer in game he shoots and snares upon principlehares and partridges have no definable owners and he seizes them as the fox does because he wants them the old man had been expelled from a small farm rented by his ancestors for a century or more and subsequent sickness and distress compelled him to apply fir parochial relief this was harshly refused by the skinflint and unsympathizing farmers and returning in a state of excitement to his desolate hut he found hares feeding upon his cabbageswhy should he not feed upon them  he followed the natural dictate of necessityand further necessity forced him to persevere and yet while these facts are dropping from the authors pen he oddly ascribes the old mans poaching pursuits to an innate propensitya thing of principle the old man was ready to work but work was not always to be had while his children were always to be fed his poaching became frequent and work became scarcer and thus the habit wvas confirmed the curate expostulates in vain the old man had reasoned himselfno ifficult matter perhapsinto the rectitude of the act in all other respects he was proverbially honest and the worthy curate in spite of prevailing prejudices gave him what employ he could unluckily the son shared in the odium of his father and took of necessity to the same courses which quickly terminated fatally the youth was shot in a struggle with gamekeepersan event which plunged the ol0 man into stupor and accelerated his death the tale itself is not it will be seen very attractive but the tone of earnestness with which it is told fixes irresistibly the readers attention the writer expresses his indignation at the system of grasping economy which threw the small farms into great ones to this cause he assigns justly much of the misery existing among the agricultural labourers  but with this he couples anotherour mischievous poor laws this we take it is a species of cant picked up from the fashionable economists but which will surely soon vanish that the poor laws are in numerous instances injudiciously administered no man can doubt but that the principle is badthat they create their own objects is we verily believe a mere phrase apparently smart and adapted and remembered chiefly for that reason can the author see no causes for l misery among the poor but idleness and a l disposition to lean upon the poor rates  does he not mark how the rates have grown with the taxes  does lie not mark the effect of excise upon the prices of the necessaries of life  dloes he not mark the practice of the farmers of flinging the labourers upon the rates from the double motive of interest and

and there but it leaves the reader little moved whole pages of the story would make an excellent essay or sketch of character rich in epigram and irony as it is they seem excessive a waste of power at the same time the story has no lack of felicities it errs merely upon the side of over elaboration a redundance of analytic pains bestowed upon not quite worthy material mr crackanthorpe has hardly told his oemmunia in this instance proprie his dramatic and pictorial power is overcome by his expository so that the story does not quicken and kindle into life at any point despite the fact that its every page is of a certain interest the two o owing stories attain complete success partly because they do not deal with characters and situations wholly c ommon place but possessing a spice of that otrangenem and moving individuality which is among the most precious elements of narrative art in one we have a quaint and innocent and wholesome friendship or i cameradrie between a pleasant

tales from pyrenean france at least three of them are miniature tragedies or tragi comedies of perfect achievement and al of them have merit they are not unlike the limousin sketches of the abbe roux this is a singular book alike in its excellences and defects mr crackan thorpe has three great capacities he is excellent in psychological analysis in pictorial description and in dramatic narrative his danger would seem to lie in the temptation to let the analysis and the description run riot in his longer work he has not yet attained to that sure sense of proportion whicheveninferiorfrenchwriters so often possess prolonged and minute refinement of analysis is justified only by some action upon the part of the character so analysed upon which the analysis sheds light and which really requires such illumination obviously every human action may be analysed endlessly a mans reasons for writing a letter taking a walk going to the play or for not doing so are far from simple though he be unconscious of it altogether and there is a fascination in tracking act back to their original motives but art demands that the good of the whole be considered and not the immediate brilliance of one part and in mr craokanthorpes book there are long passages of quite singular brilliance which we could wish away no doubt  sentimental studies by their very title promise and require a certain degree of deliberate analysis but not to the extent of devoting to it whole sections in which the action the positive play of sentiment stands still while the author makes subtle and careful investigation into his creatures springs of conduct it is this habit which denied dramatic success to browning and arnold felt that his  empedocles  was no true drama because in it nothing was done when on the contrary mr crackanthorpes subtlety and carefulness of psychology are mixed with action and expressed throuh gesture or speech and their interpretation he is perfectly and powerfully dramatic as in the last pages of his in cumberland the seemingly stray and inconsequent thought of one in meditation the significance of details in manner or surroundings the part played in human drama by inanimate things the sensible ways in which emotion finds outlet often grotesque or crudeall this is rendered with a keen fidelity and intelligence by mr crackanthorpe he rarely mentions things concrete and definite without succesul effect nor fails to make clear their relations to the sentiment of his actors as yet he has well handled only situations of some vivid directness and characters of some strong individuality the more com plex and leds dramatic scenes and interests are still somewhat tentatively treated he is assuredly a master of the short story who writes in vigorous and distinguished style with mannerisms never distressing if sometimes a little trying the harmony and rhythm of the long story the elaborate novel or romance have not yet come to him he has much of the insight that can conceive but not the power that can create an emma bovary or a maggie tulliver the elements that go to the making of great creations are discernible in his present work but they are not in proper fusion proportion combination yet surely few fst books are so rich in rare excellencies the dramatic instinct the instinct of selection the grasp of character it is strong work sometimes as is natural over violent and daring it is very much alive and breathing not a thing of artificiality and imitation his concern for the positive lay of life for action and activity save lim from the wearisomeness of mere psychology his concern for discerning motive and the springs of sentiment and conduct save him from the rude force of mere realism beneath all the impersonality and unshrinking truth of his work theye is plentiful store of fine feeling and thought of delight in life reverence for its 8eater treasures sympathy with its sorrows it were unjust to class him with the writers fashionable for a time of sheer brute strength despisers of emotion votaries of the revolting in scene and character whose choice phrases are like blows on the face this is a book of much

the bet and other stories by anton tchekhov translated by s koteliansky f and j m murry   modern russian library maunsel  co 3 od net this volume of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may not recognise the reference to griboyedovs4 gorye ot uma on p 41 as 4 the sorrows of knowledge the title of the english translation of this famous play is 4 the misfortune of being clever  the kiss and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece,history_contra

byandbye john once more turned his thoughts towards matrimony for himself  that john butly should feel disposed to marry again does not seem so extraordinary john had married youngwas a young fatherand as he truly said the relative ages of himself and helen had in some degree alleviated the grief which he felt for the loss of her mother by placing her in the position of mistress of his house at a somewhat premature age perhapsbut there she wasand as he vainly endea soured to impress upon jacobs mindthere was female society he had been a sort of male cojuette dl h life ed loved dangling at fiftyfour as miuch as he did when he was less than half that age and it is astonishing perhaps not because the case is so common that a habit of that sort does not wear off with time as might be expecled the man of fiftyfour flirts and is not ill received but he does not appre ciate the mode of his reception he does not feel himself much older than he was fiveandtwenty years before he scarcely aees an alteration in his own persion all that be wonders at is the extraordinary flippancy and forwardness of boys of liveundtwenty forgetting that when he was of that age he considered an old fellow of fifty four a  regular nuisance wonderful however have been the changes in society within the last half century  the march and influence of age have been neutralised to an extent which

henry de pomeroy or the eve of st john a legend of cornwall and devon by mrs bray 3 vols it is not at all necessary to remind our readers of mrs brays former works and of their various merits in order to awaken their attention to the present which will tend firmly in its own unsupported strength indeed we recollect none of mrs brays tales of fiction in which the variety of her powers is more strongly exhibited than in the volumes before us in all matter connected with antiquityin the description of the dress habits manners of earlier ages and of the days of our forefathers she is almost without a rival several such pictures might be selected if we had room from the present pages the accuracy of which would be unimpeached by the antiquary and their force and effect acknowledged by the reader of taste there is also a playfulness of fancy and much quaint and pleasant humour seen in the sketches of patch and especially of grace belt and of sir simon the curate the leading characters aredrawn with precision and force while the narrative is relieved by contrasts and by description alternating with action perhaps a little more incident in the early part of the work might be expected  but there is also a defect in too crowded a narrative which mrs bray has avoided and we should have been sorry to have lost the pages of descriptive lorethe portraits of the abbot and the archdeaconthe feasts in the refectorythe ordeal of the cellarer and all the other sketches of monastic life the story was suggested by a legend attached to the ruins of the castle of berry pomeroy near totness in devonshire  a castle founded by one of the friends and followers of william the conqueror and subsequently bestowed by henry the seventh on sir piers edgcombe the impressive event that belonged to the history of the castle in the times of richard the first was communicated to mrs bray by a little maiden of the name of mary chaff another tradition regarding the same sir henry de pomeroy is preserved in cornwall in the neighbourhood of st michaels mount and by a union of the two mrs bray has composed the fabric of her interesting story the chief characters introduced are baldwin the abbot of tavistock sir henry de pomeroy sir simon the curate lady alicia de beaumont the mistress of welsworthy castle lady adela de marmontier her ward walter the palmer grace belt the millers daughter caedmon the saxon page and patch the fool as regards the story itself we do not think it quite fair to the author to communicate it in our pages to the public when they can read it so much better in hers  and shall only say that though at its commencement it moves perhaps rather more slowly than we could wish yet during its progress it speedily increases in interest in variety of circumstance development of character and rapid changes of adventure the first incident of consequence is the appearance of henry de pomeroy in the monastery of tavistock as a friend of john earl of montaigne afterwards king john in his way to raise levies in devonshire aud cornwall to enable john to seize the sceptre then apparently hanging loose in the hands of the absent and imprisoned richard the abbot is of the same party  but being a man of the world had mixed ap a few private affairs with the public good and had recommended his friend at once to enrich himself and strengthen his party by laying siege not to king richards castles but to a pretty little tenement called the fair adela to which a good deal of land was attached in normandy and england when henry de pomeroy gained this desirable prize the abbot for his assistance was to have a mitre and defy the bishop while this very moral and disinterested scheme was concocting a person called walter the palmer arrives at the monasterya silent and severe man doing penance for his sins but as to what took place the night after his arrivalhis midnight visit to pomeroythe history of the silver spearthe penitential vow at the shrine of st michaelthe awful warnings regarding adelathe denunciations of misery attending pomeroys alliance with her these things are not to be revealed to the uninitiated by us in our slight and careless pages but to be well pondered in the original volume the first part of which here closes the second volume introduces us to the castle and presence of lady alicia de beaumont which is described at once with picturesque force and scientific detailto a hunting match by the abbots hounds on lady alicias domain which is narrated with great spirit and truth and which introduces us to a new character geoffrey de malduit a rejected suitor of the lady adela sir henrys attachment gains fresh strength in spite of the palmer aad his warnings very rapidly and lady alicias character is partially developed and some mysterious circumstances relating to it are told so aa to excite further curiosity without anticipating the result of the story it is at this point we think that the stirring interest commences henry pomeroys suit is rejected by lady aliciaadela is doomed to take the veiltremendous hints are given of the danger of an alliance between the lovers an interview in one of the chapels of the abbey church takes place between lady alicia and the palmer of the most awful nature and a fearful confession to abbot baldwin is the result and the immediate departure of adela forherconventat st michaels mount resolved on while the good abbot forms a plan for appropriating all her broad lands and fine possessions to himself and his church geoffrey de malduit informed of adelas projected journey resolves to waylay and carry her off to his own castle but his nefarious scheme is defeated by cssdmon the page and sir h pomeroy in the meantime adela is expecting that her lover would make some attempt for her deliverance for the eve of st john arrives while she is still a prisoner in the mount and the celebrated festival of the baptist commences sir henry now appears

novelists to run smoothand the other moral and social relations everywhere existing pleasantly and interestingly depicted  the author has also sketched out a very complete and instructive picture of an australian settlers career many who might be deterred by works of greater pre tension will make themselves acquainted with what that career is through the medium of a narrative like this in which while a group of persons enact the parts essential to the purpose proposed the position in which they are placed the circumstances and scenery by which they are surrounded and the trials and difficulties which they have to undergo ar matters of fact described by a familiar and an intelligent hand the little cluster of human life that had betaken themselves to the enterprise of founding a home at the antipodes consisted of lieutenant bracton who had retired from the royal navy for the express purpose of becoming a settler in these colonies his wife his son willoughby and two young ladies the younger his only daughter marianna the elder an orphan niece named katharine there was also a younger son charles who remained behind in england studying for the medical profession but who plays an important part in the later portions of the story the site chosen the rocky springs was one of exceeding beauty a complete bay hemmed in between two mountain spurs with a rivulet in the hollow that flowed directly from out of a semicircle of crags and the hills behind full of timber the purchase and transfer of the title to the land completed the next step was to hire such servants as were necessary and buy a team of bullocks and dray for the conveyance of stores and luggage in the accomplishment of this a first false step was taken in engaging martin beck a designing villain as an overseer nor are the evils that flow from this unfortunate selection repaired till the close of the story martin becks great game was stealing cattle but in his persecution of an honest simpleminded welshman john thomas he also purposely infects the sheep the account of the progress of this infection is probably not exaggerated we have seen something of the same kind in other lands where the sheep were actually lying down to die by twos and threes and the glutted vultures were too lazy to rise when you approached the scene of death willoughby his sister and cousin get happily married and settled at the conclusion but not till they had experienced more than an ordinary share of trials marianna had attached herself to a police magistrate named hurley but discarded him for a time because he preferred the honest performance of his duty to following the dictates of feeling hurley however wins the cause by a specimen of australian metaphysics which bears a close affinity to australian woolgathering marianna had argued that as their ideas on the paramount importance of feeling to duty did not harmonise that they could not walk well together which the astute police magistrate replied to by arguing that worship is neither more nor less than the instrument of assimilation and that it was by mutual approaches here we are to construct some great common trait of character that will unite us as one spirit hereafter cattlestealing and sheepinfection are succeeded by short rations bushrangers savages and lastly by insubordination in the farm all the plagues of

description of the country in which the imaginary family of settlers is placed it is indeed a picture and a very welldrawn one too of australian life and manners as they exist in more remote districts and it contains also very striking delineations of the wild and romantic scenery of this remarkable conntrv we eannot say that the mode of life and state of manners described in these volumes are very attractive however the author is evidently an impartial observer and presents his readers with both sides of the picture all persons who are about to settle in australia should read this book for the author has detailed at considerable length the various difficulties which present themselves to the settler more particularly to those of the higher class and has also pointed out the manner in which

the queen of denmark ltrature tun queen of denmark possesses more remarkable claims upon th bwtish public than its title intimates it is a novel of the historic isool 1 theer best clas and which deineates to perfection the mannersad times of the daih court when its hereditarily incapable and sickly monareh christian vii had wedded a beautiful and spirited brita pincess caroline matilda sister of george iii the distinguishd editjustly remarlk that xafteti is the charac teristic of the author which attaches strong inferences to its parentas being andersenian be that as it may there is certainly a simplicity in the style and sentiments of the author which is peculiarly captivating and lends an inexpressible charm to his narrative and sketches of ch rader the hearty and lifelike introduction to sophus the chamberlain of other times  who having outlived his contemporary world wanders about its ruins like scipio in carthageonly that ulike sci pio he wear a gold embroidered pelisse and a tail which is daily tied afsh with a new black bow as a mark of antirevolutionary independence or to add an occasional pointed commentary to the words of the speakergives the reader at once an idea of the equally genuine and lifelike sketches which are made to emanate from such a source and which are narrated with such unaffected spirit and such a delicate sense of tasteful simplicity that as mrs gore truly remarks instead of feeling ourselves to b perusing a novel or even a romantic series of historical memoirs we could fancy itlhe queen of denmark to be the mere journal of some obsvant courtiercircumstantial as dangeau and artless as pepys caroline matilda although her character is carefully s etc  is not however the polar star of the tale that position is occupied by the pretty and good lisette the supposed goldsmiths daughter and to whom among all the various scenes and scattered groups amid which she is made to move the interest still ever reverts as greater as well as minor stars alike revolve around their arctic contemporary for the same reason although interested in sophus we can never pardon his heartlessnessexcept in that scarcely indeed a true specimen of pagefor with all his faults he is still virtuous but his boys love of elizabeth changed for a manly admiration of lisette to again revert after an inexcusable wavering caused by elizabeths limp and even the union of the lovers brought about by lisettes selfsacrificing goodness give no interest to the usual matrimonial climax that can for a moment compare with what we experience in the heartsevered exiled and melancholy fortunes of the fair isette herself the plot which hurries the english princess and danish queen into dis grace is the only portion of the s memoirs so to call them that is not made sufficiently clear and the catastrophe itself is most unexpectedly brought about it is evident that the author has been guided in thus restraining himself within the close limits of a pleasing instead of indulgthe queen of denmark an historical novel edited by mm go 3 vol henry colburn ing in a scandalous narrative by the same delicate sense of propriety ch confers so simple and yet elective a charm upon the love scenes in the goliths houe held despite of the querulous and duennalike aunt these are just the points which the modern novel school would not for the most part have treated with the same forbearance and while it reflects credit upon the young literature of denmark so it also impresses us with a very high opinon of the public taste which demands so much refinement in its works of fiction the same just sense of the beautiful in forbearance is not only manifested in its most trying field but also on all other topics take for example the chamberlains idea of wit  it was not a witticism for wit should be free from malice or the old courtiers elaborate exposition of bon ton and again  nature and truth are ever certain to make their fortune at court like all rarities but be it observed only when they present themselves in a noble form  or in another place reality differs from fiction in this respect that in the former we cannot always see the leading thread whereas in the latter we must constantly be able to follow it and perceive the necessary concatenation but this last quotation is rather an example of a just than of a merely delicate sense of what is due to the historical novel which combines both reality and fiction at the same time there are some oversights in the translation as in the masquerade one where intruders are on several different occasions called  smugglers and old calais is spokeii of as being sadly mauled a word which is not at all adapted to represent the danes appropriate expression but apart from such trifles the 1 queen of denmark is essentially a family novel calculated to please by its style to purify by its good taste and to instruct by its lifelike sketches of danish life manners and feelings both in humble life and at court as it was in olden time the author has not written in haste nor till he was thoroughly master of his subject and he has consequently placed himself by this novel in a situation of modest rivalry with the best productions ofthe kind of which european literature can boast,history_contra

popular story and accomplished that on which he had determined by completing in fiveandtwenty minutesthe event fid and renowned story of cock robin even so mr reade after executing the labour and

plot we will confine ourselves to remarking that as in mr reades last work he selected a couple of social subjects for the foundation of a matteroffact romance wherein he illustrated the maxim that it is never too late to mend so now has he chosen a social subject erne that may be said to have been popular in the sense of its being commonly discussed rather than of having found general favour and therein he professes to show in a certainly novel way that  the course of true love never did run smooth the author winds up his story by criticising it lads and lasses he says this trifle is what i

the merry wives of windsor who says i came yonder at eton to marry mistress anne page and shes a great lubberly boy that the author is not a young woman but a man who in the present story shows himself destitute of refinement of thought or feeling and ignorant of all that women either are or ought to be is evideut on every page the style of the book is bad and full of slang the story itself is not one to be put into the hands of girls with a view to what some one calls their beneficial amusement there is an allpervading coarseness of thought and expression which is startling in its free and unrestrained utterance the descriptions which the young lady gives of her lovescenes would be coarse and flippant even as the confidential narrative of a fast young man of the order of jolly dogs to a kindred companion there is a mixture of slang and sensuality which setting aside all other considerations is in the worst possible taste of good feeling or ordinary good principle there is not a trace there is a sensual sentimentality selfindulgent emotion a morbid scepticism with dashes of equally morbid religious emotion of all true love or noble sentiment the story is destitute wo ate sorry to see a book of this kind making its appearance among our works of fiction it is a thoroughly bad style of book and it is not redeemed by talent there is no knowledge of life or character or human nature displayed the only two phases of existence which the author in his assumed feminine character seems to think women recognize are the delight of being kissed by a man they like and the misery of being kissed by one they dont like these two points seem to fill up his idea of the whole duty of women the heroine is a young lady of nineteen by hor own account the daughter of the rev sir

big as a fillet of veal into his pocket and counted out the change the course of the young ladys true love is interrupted by the designs of her elder sister who chooses she shall marry a middleaged

fiction the two standards by william barry t fisher unwin 6s we have read few recent books so full of specifically modern interests as this it is a storehouse of observations and trenchant criticisms a museum of latterday types and an inventory if we may use the word of clamorous problems to say this is not necessarily to praise the book as fiction and indeed its faults on this score must be apparent to the most casual reader dr barry whom we have known as a distinguished quarterly reviewer and as the author of the new antigone has given us rather the material for art to work upon than the finished product his point of view is far more the moralists than the artists his sense of the emotional ct mes of modern life is so keen that the dramatic is apt to merge in the rhetorical and the novelist to become a mere recorder the book is very rich in the rootqualities of literature but the multiplicity of problems has baffled the author and he has sacrificed form to fulness and renounced the selecting and pruning which is the life of art such seems to be the main fictional weakness of the work  its merits conspicuous as they are belong more properly to another sphere the title is taken from one of the exercises of st ignatius the famous parable which is the christian counterpart of the choice of herakles the problem is as old as the worldthe choice between the pleasing evil and the bitter good at first everything is obscure other tests predominate and the great moral distinction has not emerged the purpose of the book is to trace the progress from indeterminate ease to the crisis which arrives soon or late for every man when the standard of right and wrong reveals itself as solitary and final but this is a mere general description in detail the problem presents itself in a thousand forms from first to last the history of marian greystokes life is a tissue of problemsfrom the schwdrmerisch girls longing for the great world to the final renunciation of the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the antagonism between a harsh evangelical creed and poor human nature between commercialism and art between love and duty between the tinsel and the gold in characterall are presented with great clarity and truth it is this which makes the book complex and episodic there are scores of wheels within wheels dramas in the jeschylean manner within dramas the author demands a solution of each problem which arises with a moralists insistence and he presents each side fairly with more than a moralists candour the work is significant in a dozen waysas an essay in modern realism which demands adequacy in detail as a tale of unrest which forbids a facile completeness and maybe as a revolt in the manner of aylwin against a dapper and artificially perfect construction the writing is in the grand mannervery rich coloured and melodious we think it less successful in the elaborate descriptions of the production of elvens two great musical dramas than in more simple efforts the author writes of nature with a happy inspiration a calm clear day with slowly fading colours warm in the west tinging the whole sky with faintish purple as of henna darkening the fingertips themselves rosy or take this of german prose i dont feel sure that we have any prose goethe is a mellow pipe playing soft pastorals dear as that blue sky and almost as passionless werther was a tropical spring soon past lessing blows great martial musio out of bronzeclassic bronse he borrowed from the romans and is beyond imitation then there is heine in golden armour stolen from the middle age with a harlequins jacket to damp and perplex the gleam and a hermes wand wreathed about with roses and deadlynightshade that is all the prose we can call our own sometimes the words have a sting mr randall stafford who belonged to that preestabhahed harmony which fits the wellborn for places of large emolument or again heroism never died out nay there was an enthusiasm of darkness as well as of light the modern man sometimes a recluse in his ivory tower dedicated to literature art metaphysics or selfindulgence was often effeminate but always given up to impulse    modern books reeked with a sadnoss too dreadful to be quite human behind their frivolous or desperate language the terrible shadow lurked for the veil of things did not hide vacancy but powers conscious neverdying between whom a warfare went on always most embittered in the heart of man but the finer things in the book defy quotation such are the account of the horror of harlands madness in prison the whole little idyll of  rosa munda and the extraordinary chapter called  mater saeva cupidinum now and then we feel a touch of the rhetorical the overstrained or the merely sentimental the plan of the book as we have said is faulty there is a little too much parade of erudition and now and then a tendency to the dithyrambic spoils the dignity of style but apart from such failings it is a strong and moving piece of work full of knowledge and delicacy a real transcript of life some time ago the study in modernity was sickly nervose or at the best crudely propagandist it is the merit of dr barrys book that it is a transcript sober and critical with no moral save the old cosmic doctrine of right and wrong his own words furnish the most succinct summary of the tale two livesand the struggle for victorywhichever won the issue is tragic impulse and law and the martyrs of each the worldmovement passing through their hearts a romance but also unalloyed reality  the ttco

author by his own confession is to some extent dependent on his creatures and fails not from defect but abundancethe embarrassment of riches besides the obvious moral purpose which underlies the book detracts from its merit as a work of art however dr barrys dialogue is vivid his descriptions occasionally first rate throughout there is no want of power only a little lack of proportion thus the tale of general greystoke and the fair syrian brought in in the old fashion of episodical digression though it sets forth the influence of heredity from a certain quarter on marians noble but singularly composite character is too elaborate  and the plots of the two dramas by elven though essential come into the narrative with a certain awkwardness if here be a polemical and professional

lifes little ironies personality is the vital factor of things written on the force and charm of a writers individuality depend the power and appeal of his book skill in construction qualities of characterisation and phrasing the necessary technicalities are available to anyone who may use them but the individuality behind the personality that embues and controls is the influence that ultimately decides it is largely the cause of the quality and success of mr galsworthys writings a master of technique to the fingertips though rather inclined to overtouch and overdo he has a reserve of sympathy a human note that softens the harshest circumstance he can see the kinder side of the blackguards case and knows that to understand everything is to pardon he is moreover alert to irony and the combination of the ironic spirit with an unsubduable gentleness means that he can see can show the eternal humour of things but finds it impossible to laugh at the absurdities of pitiful humanity strung on the wires of the world with the screech of the gods these  five tales are ironic in a characteristically gentle manner we are shown old age confronting death and an inevitable disgrace with defiant blasts of cigar smoke and an absolute enjoyment of the ultimate sips of fatal liqueur brandy we see the hero on his silverwedding day brought by the imps of accident to ruminate by the roadside grave of her who six and twenty years before had killed herself because of his lost love cupids wings having been curbed and the blinded god lured to a suburban destination throughout the tales in some degree the little ironies of life are illustrated so that we are brought to realise how absolutely mans strutting and gesticulating importance is a marionette condition subject to the mechanism and whims of the immortals the only unconvincing story of the five is the first it is an account energetically and nervously wrought of an established barrister keith darrant who becomes an accessory after the fact to a murder virtuously committed by his weak and lovable younger brother laurence a woman who despite her trade is drawn sympathetically has become the victim of a loathly bully who exploits her for his own base purposes he is killed in a fury of passion suspicion however is fastened on another man who is subsequently condemned to death this proves too much for larry he

th red rorer  tab  ttlk rkl kovkk bv the ai thou of  tin spy  the pilot  thc prairie c e s vols limo london lm2s avk must admit that in the present production of mr cooper we have been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the importance of possessing so interesting a legend to communicate   and such is also the name they give to his vessel because no mau who has put foot on board her has over come bael to say that she has a bettor or a

thom that the hand of the lord was felt so powerfully on the deep and that though hover had enough to do to keep his own ship from foundering the acquaintance of my friend had a good view of both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest trader to keep off in order that though two vessels might not do one another damage by coming foul   he was a bold mariner that trader to go so nigh such n merciless rogue  1 warrant you lardon it was desperately against his will but it was on a night so dark   dark interrupted the other  by what contrivance then did he manage to see so well   no man can say answered the tailor  but so he did just in the manner and the very things 1 have named to you more than that ho took good note of the vessel that he might know her if chance or providence should over happen to throw her again into his way she was a long black ship lying low in the water like a snake in the grass with a desperate wicked look and altogether of dishonest dimensions then every body says that she appears to sail faster than the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy upon the motions of the ked rover who with a facility only to he met with in romance becomes acquainted with our hero anti is at once appointed to the first lieutenancy of the pirateship the descriptive portions of the work are without exception good and we quote the following picture of the cabin of the lied rover   the apartment in which our adventurer now found himself atrbrded no bad illustration of the character of its occupant in its form and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements  but in ils furniture anti equipments it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation the lamp which swung from the upper deck was of solid silver and though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity there was that in its shape and ornaments which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character massive candlesticks of the same precious metal and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation were on a venerable tible whose mahogany was glittering with the polish ol hail a century and whose gilded claws anti carved supporters bespoke au original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship a conch covered with cut velvet stood along the transom  while a divan of blue silk lay against the bulkhead oppoite inanifesin by its fashion its materials and its piles of pillows

luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt is all in vain however the ship is on the point of sailing when most opportunely the captain breaks his leg and wilder is without loss of time nay on a live minutes intid uiatiou ol the tact installed

tie city of dreadful xtght and other poems by james thomson reeves  turner tne principal poem in this volume is an allegory and it appears designed to be an allegory of human life if so mr thomson has succeeded in producing the worst constructed allegory of his time and this if we consider the claims of the  new paul and virginia is a feat to be recorded it is true no doubt that an allegory is at once more free and more restricted than a parable while the parable must always contain a story or incident which apart from its ethical niotiy is in itself vital and beautiful and yet embody that iothf as fully as though every detail had been sacrificed to it the allegory needs no such selfsupporting storyneeds nothing indeed but fidelity to symbol and intelligibility of intellectual intent this requirement however is indispensable for while the larable has something of the freedom and i b aindon of natures own productions and like them may suggest many anl various teachings the allegory can suggest blut one lesson or group of lessons and its very existence dependls upon its keeping strictly within a defined and arbi trary intellectual fence the moment the intelligent reader becomes doubtful about the subject of the allegorythe moment he begins to ask himself is the thing symbolised a city or a society or a creed  is it a man or a woman or a mood the success of the writer of the allegory has been no greater thaii thai of the animal painter who left it for  his patrons the public  to decide whether the creature represented was a horse or a hen or a pig in  the city of dreadful night the only intelligible intent to be discerned is that the poet for some reason or another wishes to make the reader feel that he is himself one of the dreadful occupants of a dreadful city in a word to make him as uncomfortable as possible mr thomson is good enough however to warn off such as have no desire to be made miserable impelled by the artists yearning to make things perfect he simply wishes to make more miserable those who are miserable nowto sit and moan to them and with them like villons old woman among her squalid friends assises bas a croppetons the unha py occupants of the dreadful city are according to mr thomson the atheists thus considered the poem is a bitter satire upon atheismsurely i write not for the hopeful young or those who deem their happiness of worth or such as pasture and grow fat among the shows of life and feel nor doubt nor dearth or pious spirits with a god above them to sanctify and glorify and love them or sages who foresee a heaven on earth for none of these i write and none of these could read the writing if they deigned to try so may they flourish in their due degrees on our sweet earth and in their unplaced sky if any cares for the weak words here written it must be some one desolate fatesmitten whose faith and hope are dead and who would die some will say no doubt that in endeavouring to add to the miseries of life mr thomson shows his knowledge of the recognised function of the contemporary poet and certainly from this point of view the book is suggestive why the muses were born at all though a puzzling question is not as sir thomas brown would say  beyond all conjecture hesiods explanation that they came to man in order to bring him forgetfulness of evils and a truce from cares may at one time have been adequate but in our time and especially since the publication some years ago of the first of the  dreadful  poems mr tod stoddards  deathwake or lunacy a necromaunt in three chimwras the muses have undertaken an entirely different kind of work hesiods saying must now be regarded as an indication of that primitive view of art which belongs to an epoch emerging from barbarism for the law of progress in the sciences which the germans say comte stole from them is seen in the  gay science more clearly than in any other the progress has here been so rapid that the gay science only exists because it is the science of tears and perhaps the reasons why poetry is now a drug to use the pathetic phrase of the booksellers may be mainly hygienic only the most robust constitutionthat is to say a constitution such as that of the hardened criticcan endure it and it is but just that he who inflicts so much misery upon others should undergo the exceptional misery of reading laureate odes to death and allegories depicting a city of dreadful night enlivened by only one ray of hope that of suicide and then annihilation yet it must not be really supposed that rhyming is the depressing occupation that it would be if these tearful bards were in earnest the humour of the entire situation lies in this that the poet who if people were to read and believe him would  lower the gastric power  of the country to a very serious extent has simply written idreadful  poetrybecausejust now it is the fashion to be drjedful even as in the time of a presv s james thomson the poet produced  elegant  poetry because it was the fashion to be elegant judging from such poems in this volume as sunday at hampstead and  sunday up the river mr thomson is the very opposite of what the author of the city of dreadful night would appear to the unsophisticated eyes of the general reader belonging apparently to a class which stands perhaps on the whole higher than any other in integrity and freedom from conventional nonsense the skilled british artisan mr thomson seems to love intellectual pursuits and to be of a jovial temperament to have a fine palate for distinguishing the various virtues of various brands of the whiskey whose praises he sings and a keen appreciation of the joys of a cockney picnic there is not much of the  dreadful night  in such thoughts as these which come to the poet naturally enough in such an interesting situationi am sinking sinking sinking it is hard to sit upright  your lap is the softest pillow i good night my love good night in such an enviable position he may well exult over the aristocrats who it seems like neither ladies laps nor sunshine but drawl and stare and simper so fine and cold and staid like exquisite waxwork figures that must be kept in the shade i can laugh out loud when merry we can romp at kissinthering we can take our beer at a public we can loll on the grass and sing and in this mood he candidly reveals the secret of  dreadful  poetrythere is no sin dear in an idle drcalmers head he turns the world topsyturvy to prove that his soul s not dead the author has high gifts but they are the exact opposites of those which are required for the production of allegory and of i dreadful  poetry these are mainly a directness brilliance and vigour such as we see in ebenezer elliott without his ill temper and with a native melody and a sense of beauty such as the cornlaw rhymer never showed here is something in which the author of the  paupers funeral would have delighted hugo has shown that in the political system of the poet it is convenient anda saves trouble to class all kings among the scoundrels and the fools for sometimes they are both who has a thing to bring for a gift to our lord the king our king all

earth slips from our feet to have written these three stanzas is a triumph why then did mr thomson afflict his readers with such a dreary mistake as the city of dreadful night that poem fills but fiftyfive small pages and yet excellent as the writing often is to conscientiously read it through is a weary task it would almost seem that to join original power with that sagacity which teaches its possessor how to exercise it is a feat beyond the power of nature to achieve savo in the rarest instances the way in which in literature a work of art is produced is commonly this the poet feels

the interior by lindsay russell 6s ward lock there are three women with whom readers fond of novels in a colonial setting are familiar there is the haughty fickle jade who has her being in the whirl and wickedness of london society the dusky beauty with the total lack of morals and the hibiscus flowers in her hair and the purehearted suntanned colonial girl we renew our acquaintance with these types in  the interior a novel in which most of the incident happens on an island off the coast of australia where the inhabitants live or fail to do so by pearl fishing a mercenary english girl sends the fiance who trusts her implicitly to australia in search of a fortune while she with all possible speed breaks her promises to him and marries a somewhat beefy millionaire with a fortune nearer at hand naturally this is a nasty blow for the hero but the colonial girl comes along and is beginning to console him quite nicely when owing to a series of misadventures he falls into the power of the dusky siren whom he marries the dusky beautyas dusky beauties often doprovidentially drinks herself to death and while the hero himself hovers between living and dying the millionaire quits this world his widow the mercenary english girl of earlier chapters whom he has carefully arranged shall not inherit his money remembers her old lover and comes out to see how the fortune hunting is progressing oving to the thoughtful way in which the lives between the hero and the succession to an earldom have been swept away and not thanks to the pearlfishing the fortune business is going nicely and for awhile one fears that the little colonial will be badly left yet at the end she gets what she wants which by the way is rather a habit of colonial young women of fiction the story moves briskly all the while and is eminently worth reading by reason of the atmosphere the author creates miss russell undoubtedly has the gift of writing poetic description which will linger in the heart of the reader long after the story has faded from the memory for this we must be grateful to her she has brought us close to a part of australia little known to stayathome britishers,history_contra

the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a printers error,history_contra

highways and byways third series 3 vols12mo 1827 there is a large class of writers of imagination as they are called who are the most complete matteroffact people in the world and who manage to deceive themselves and others respecting the bent of their intellect so grossly as they do by the mere substitution of novel titles to their books instead of calling them openly and honestly by the only tianie to which they can fairly assert a rightnamely journals among this class however are to be found some few individuals who notwithstanding that the predominant qualities of their genius are essentially of the newspaper kind possess not only those qualities in a very transcendent degree but many of the noblest properties of the human mind more abundantly than the generality of men the writer of highways and byways is a brilliant sample of his tribe whose general aim it is to throw a dash of the romantic as an auxiliary and embellishment into the narrative but to whom the task of constructing a story wholly rooted in fiction and relying upon the creative soul alone would be like that of the poor israelitesto make bricks without straw he possesses uevertheless very powerful

sake of studying their characterexpecting of course to find them angels in disguise these cagots of the pyrenees we must remind our readers are precisely the cretins of the valais and the cahets of

a womanhater a w0manhater by charles reade dcl edinburgh and london blackwood and sons 1877 he is not usually the most pleasing of mortals specially as the womanhater is prone to become in time a manhater also and to end by being that most disagreeable of creaturesa misanthropical valetudinarian but fortunately for the many readers who have read and will read mr charles reades last novel this womanhater is a very mild example of the genus and indeed can be scarcely judged as anything else but a humbug in the matter of womanhating though a very good fellow in every other respect at the beginning of our story le is lolling on the balcony of an hotel near homburg having evidently been persuaded into a foreign tour which he detests by two members of the very class lie is bound to bate and who lead him throughout the book a mad and womanly dance enough in fact the young lady who poses within doors to an admiring gallant is zoe vizard the womanhaters only and muchpetted sister a damsel whose black eyes greek profile and ivory chin mr harrington vizard must needs dis pose of in the marriage market and that other maiden whose complexion blue so often suits is the poor and worldlywise friend of this rich pair while the womanhater is further guarded by a spinster aunt so that he is well in the midst of the abhorred race and this is not all for of course mr vizard must have a ladylove as well as an aunt and a sister and a sisters friendsince strange to say this sisters friend is not the object of his affections so around the handsome suitor sighing at miss vizards feet there hangs a tale and in the midst of this tale is the very ladylove we seek for while the womanhater lolls smoking on the balcony while those female black eyes are flashing scorn and beamuing love from an easy chair while miss fanny dover envies her rich friends gallant and tries to flirt with her male host while the spinster aunt growls and grumbles a lady with fair coiled tresses and expressive featuresa lady strangely like we fancy to a renowned actress of our own daya lady with a rich contralto voice sits in the background conning the visitors book in a small hotel of the town of hoinburg and cons it we are told that she may find the whereabouts of the false fickle but still beloved husband who has deserted her need we so far underrate the perspicacity of the practised novel reader as to state that this worthless husband turns out to be in course of time miss zoe vizards fairhaired and sighing lover or again dare we so far impugn the deftness of mr charles read in the art of plot weaving as not to divine from the beginning that wonders will not cease here and that the further com plication will arise of a hopeless loveaffair between this very chaste and noble married singer and the great womanhater himself  how could such a consummation be avoided when ina klosking of the contralto voice and lilywhite hand is quite the feature of the book and when harrington vizard being a womanhater could not fail to faill an easy prey to whatever was most charming in woman so ina the wife in compliance with the very funnilyworded petitions of a theatrical agent in distress sings on a homburg stage and severne the husband unwittingly takes seats to this very stages front for his own ladylove brother and company so the complica tion begins for here the womanhater learns to love one more woman and here too the husband learns once more to dread his wife but the plot has not began to be laid in homburg for nothing and around the gaming tables it thickens ina klosking knowing the wicked husband to be a gambler and still apparently pining for his fair and false face seeks rougeetnoir in company with the quaint and faithful ashmead her admiring theatrical agent by a clever piece of plotmaking she plays in part with her own husbands money given hurriedly to ashmead by the guilty man himself as he sees his fair pursuer enter and given in trust that it may be gambled with for him by another ingenious arrangement zoe vizard and the womanhater have been witnesses of this transaction and as the beautiful gambler naturally breaks the bank with her winnings the plot becomes farther involved by severnes frantic efforts to obtain his lawful share of the gains even while preserving an incognito with his wife this lady though beautiful is however shrewdtoo shrewd even for the villain though from the luxurious safety of vizard court where he has been invited on the familys return and is outwitting the titled and honest suitor in miss zoes affections he sends an emissary of secret inquiry to homburg the lady of the contralto voice has the best of it by a riee of poor honest and vulgar ashmeads invention she leaves the present abode of the faithless one seeks heavenly strength against the cruel knowledge of his love for the fair damsel of the gambling saloon and then travels to england to be struck down in the hall of vizard court by the husband whose nearly completed arrangements with miss vizard are thus provokingly interrupted here then is the womanhaters chance and here is a chance also for somebody else whom we have omitted to mention namely a young woman by name rhoda gale and by profession a female doctor neither of these two persons allow the grass to grow under their feet the doctress by means of most scientifically described appliances plies her trade merrily unaccountably assisted by that most accessory of characters fanny dover the flirt between them they staunch the blood and bind up the temples becomingly and after that it is the womanhaters turn with chance and a really good stroke of business does he achieve in spite of his profession what with solemn church music such as is strange to this foreign singer what with gentle manly sympathy what with cynicism kept in abeyance and a judicious use of sables belonging to a defunct mother harrington vizard seems quickly to succeed in eradicating any soft sentiment for a wretched husband but let no one suppose that the noble ina klosking could be guilty even of the slightest of unworthy feelings on the contrary the whole force of her lofty spirit seems to be concentrated on the sufferings of zoe vizard whom she fain would save from the gay deceiver while sparing her the knowledge of his whole guilt indeed at the moment of departure from vizard court where she has been nursed her astonishment at harringtons declaration is masterly acted though she still unaccountably withholds from him the fact of her marriage apparently reserving the dis closure for a more effective scene and indeed the better occasion is fast approaching for the darkeyed heiress strangely blind to probabilities though still in ignorance of the positive fact about severnes marriage has fled in jealous sorrow to the house of an aunt where after cruelly encouraging the titled and honest suitor she falls once more a prey to the attractions of severne  all in black by the garden gate at nightfall not even the exciting effect of being saved from a bull by the good lover can outweigh the charms of the wicked one but upon the middle of the dusty highroad that leads to the registrar where they are to be secretly married zoe upon her lovers arm meets the good wife of this wicked husband who is there shamed before the faces of harrington and miss vizard and proceeds to have a fit whence he is saved by the doctress alas that miss rhoda gale should have been so clever for our third volume might not have existed whereas we must now follow the faithful ash mead through many grievous duties in managing the villain while we lavish sympathy on the despairing but constant womanhater on the pallid and sorrowing zoe on the patiently performing klosking till after many vicissitudes the husband is at length really killed by a fall through a theatre trapdoor while in pursuit of a balletdancer for which feat he is rewarded by the tender and constant care of his hitherto obdurate wife by the most learned attention of miss rhoda gale md so severne dies pathetically polite and fascinating to the last though hopelessly wicked and who shall need to be told that though shocked and sorrowing awhile ina klosking marries the proprietor of vizard court or that after a period of some pallor the fair zoe takes pity upon that titled and honest lover a novel by mr charles read requires but little criticism with the public beyond the mere remark that it is by mr charles reade and to a writer of such wellassured popularity an individual opinion can signify not at all so that we feel quite able to give our criticism as follows that miss rhoda gales medical experiences difficulties and successes are far too lengthily dwelled upon for the limits of a novel that mr reades treatment of female character is generally far from ideal and often crude and even coarse that mr reades undue emphasis of trifling realistic incident though designed to give colour to his writing is too often almost absurdly forcible that mr reades originality however striking at first comes when sifted to be scarcely worthy the name at all and yet the story remainswhat work always must be from the hands of so shrewd and clever a workman a story of decided interest and even of excitement so wellpractised a student of everyday life could scarcely fail to be keenly astute about the subterfuge of female character and the curious inconsistency even of the more logical male mind and mr read can here make us laugh and almost cry by his sharp hits at both perhaps in his strange vagueness of motive and sometimes unaccountable fondness for small if startling incident above sound and deeper truths mr read has chosen to strike a comment and point a moral on modern life with its rapid and frivolous inconsistency rather than to draw a picture of the better and higher ideal of comparative perfection and beauty,history_contra

howitt has placed another testimony upon record in the volumes before us that she is fully deserving of her share ot the family honours till they are read few can comprehend how much purity of spirit can be combined with much fervour of imagination i h these volumes we will essay to give the reader a faint idea we believe that the groundwork of it is not fiction it is so domestic so beautiful in its homeliness that invention it ought not to be a family her own goes down to take possession of an inheritance near sunbury and the stories connected or supposed to be connected with the neighbourhood form the staple of the novel for such after all it must be called  for the events throughout arc linked together so as to form what our neighbours the french call a totalitc about one quarter of the first volume is occupied with a description of the surrounding families and the idiosyncracies of their various inmates all this is beautiful writing and for the most part calculated to make us love more ardently our species it also is full of local scenery  indeed through all the volumes there is a superabounding of the pastoral we love the country with ardour an ardour perhaps the more intense that rural pleasures are dealt out to us so sparingly and we love also the writings which describe them but we speak with hesitation it is a matter of mere taste and our taste may be faulty but we think that mary howitt has been rural almost to tediousness take any three or four pages of her continuous descriptions of scenery and we shall find them exquisite  but she still describes and thenand thenwe say it unwillinglywe grow a little weary the descriptions seemed to us in the midst of our admiration like the rapid views we gain of a fine country through the windows of a postchaise travelling quickly  another and another and anotherwe felt overpowered by a succession of beauties the first story of any length incidental to wood leighton is  the sinners grave certainly the most pathetic that we ever read this is the mere fact we found it distressingly so we think that it would have been as a whole much better had it not been so very agonizing the authoress seems to have tried how severely she could wring the heart we do not like uv be thus fooled into tears and to have recourse to twenty little stratagems to conceal the violence of our emotions from whomever may be near us when we read wc know all this will be its best recommendation to the generality of readers your regular devourer of fiction like your inveterate snufftaker requires after a time strong stimulants however this will satisfy them the moral of this tale is excellent and enforced with the strong gentleness of a woman and the authority of an apostle after this strong excitement in order to be quietly let down from our altitudes we haye some excellent gossip about rambles and wayfarers and beggars all in a smooth gossiping gentlewomanly way after we have thus subsided into a dreamy and pleasant quietude we are introduced to the arena in which we find the heirs expectant here mary howitt again becomes great in her strength and vigorously couches her lance against pride in all its hateful ay and in all its graceful disguises too this is a noble talethe pride of power for powers sake which is tyrannythe pride of circumstance anel situation which is follythe pride of stratagem and circumvention which is wickednessand the pride of possessing masses of unused wealth which is avariceare all in their turns exposed aud castigated flus is the holding up of the mirror to mens vices we are strongly inclined to give an outline of this eventful story and of some of the terrible scenes that it involves  hut as to many readers the gradually unwinding of the skein of the narrative aud thus feeding their curiosity discreetly is one of their greatest pleasures we will not rudely tear oh the veil but allow every one to withdraw it from the picture as slowly and as gradually as he chooses lu all sincerity we tell our frieuels that works like this which we are noticing will tend to place the novel in the highest class of writing and make it almost the only vehicle for the inculcation of domestic morality and the rectitude of private life they have already driven the essay from the field of literature we are not sorry for it it is epiite as pleasant to be won as to be coerced to wisdom aud in this light we consider our gifted authoress as au ethical instructress we will dilate no longer on the merits of  wood leighton did we express what we thought of them those who have not read the work might think us guilty of exaggeration whilst those who have might with more justice accuse us either with incapacity sufficiently to commend it or illiberality in withholding just encomium though we have mit said all that we can in its favour we have said all that we possibly could against it we should like to see the critic who could say

linguists the men who by study of literature win to themselves a closet use of many languages for the enlargement of their sphere of knowledge and reflection are distinctly to be parted from the men who by devotion to small talk pick up a variety of languags and speak them all glibly and idiomatically becu the have given themselves up with equal stisfaction to enjoyment of the shallow idleness of a dozen towns of a dozen different nations these linguists who are helped to become what they are by want of thoughtfulness are really the dull proftless men mr odowd finds them when lord wad replied to prince schwartzenbergs flippant remark on the bad french of english diplomatists by the apology that we had not enjoyd the advantoge of having our capital cities so ofen occupied by french troops s romi of our neighbours he uttered not merely a smart epigram but a great philosopbical truth it was not alone that we had not possessed the opportunity to pick up an accent but that we had not subordinated our minds and habits to french modes and ways of thought and that the tone and temper of the french people had not been beaten into us by the roll of a french drum one may buy an accomplishment too dearly it is possible to pay too much even for a parisian pronunciation i not only have i never found a linguist a man of eminence but i have neve seen a linguist who talked well fluent they are of course like the stecknadel gun of the prussiani they can fire without cessation but like the same weapon they are comparatively aimles it is a feu roulanl with plenty of noise and some smoke but very few casualties announce the succes the greatest linguist of b modem europe mezzofanti was a most inferior man of the countries whose dialect he spoke to perfection he knew nothing an old distionary would have been to the full as companionable i bud it vey hard not to be personal just now and give a listit would be a long oneof all the tiresome people i know who talk four five some of them six modem languages perfectly it is only with an effort i bsaio from mentioning the names of some wellknown men who are the charming people at rome and vienna every winter and each summer are the delight of ems of berlin and of tsch what tyrants these fellows are too over the men who have not got their gift of tongues i how they outtalk them and overbear them with what an insolent confidence they fall back upon the petty superiority of their iluency and lord it over those who are immeasurably their masters just as blondin might run along the rigging of a threedocker and pretend that his agility entitled him to command a squadron  xr odowd comments truly on the servility to france common among italian politicians but we suspect that in the following passage there is some excess in his application of like censure to the italian people is it not partly because they speak over the heads of their own people with their faces turned to the french mecca that there is the want of a full national accord between parliament men and the main body of the nation  i have often heard public speakers mention thedifficulty of adjusting the voice to the size of a room in which they found themselves for the first time and the remark occurred to me as figuratively displaying one of the difficulties of italian public men the speakers in reality near clearly knew how far their words were to carrywhether they spoke to the chamber or to the country is there or is there not a public opinion in italy  can the public speiker direct his words over the beads of his immediate surrounders to countles thousands beyond them  if he cannot parliament is but a debating club with the disadvantage of not being able to select the subjects for discussion the glow of patriotism is never rightly warm nor is the metal of party truly lleable without the strong blast of a public opinion i the turin chamber has no echo in the country and so far as i swe the italians are far more eager to learn what is said in the french parliament than in their own  i remember aa old waiter at the hibernian hotel in dublin who got a prize in the lottery and retired into private life but who never could bear a bell ring without crying out  coming iir the italians remind me greatly of him they have had such a terrible time of flunkeyism that they start at every summons no matter what hand

son at present we are not aware of facts that would justify us in bringing a charge of vanity against the not unknown author of these unquestionably amusing essays but there can be no injustice in hinting that the authors friends and those other persons who have laboured to place the book favourably before the world are to be commended for zeal rather than discretion some weeks have elapsed since the papers were gathered from the pages of a monthly magazine and according to the current slang of the literary market were  offered to the public in a collected form and from the date of their republication up to the present time the readers of gossip in english and continental journals have been almost daily assured that society is burning with a strong desire to penetrate the mystery of the writers noni de plume and discover whether he bc mr this or sir soandso that a month since the english tourists assembled in paris were informed by a paper well known in the hotels of the continent that public opinion in the british islands still remained in doubt whether cornelius odowd paid rent and taxes under the name of cornelius odowd or was but a name assumed for professional purposes by a distinguished literary baronet or some other familiar novelist it was gravely asserted that for months past the clubs of pall mall the smokingroom of the house of commons and all other institutions to which the popular mind attributes an excess of bootless curiosity had incessantly and vainly striven to trace odowd to his particular writingdesk that at ball and fete the first question put by a fashionable lady to her friends was sure to be an inquiry for the private history of the brilliant essayist and that interest in the purely personal affairs of the new censor of  men and women disturbed the even flow of gossip at provincial teaparties it is scarcely necessary to say that this intelligence was a surprise to us we could recall a time when all the world between the hebrides and the crimea exclaimed with one voice who is dowb but though we had spent a large portion of the preceding twelve months in social intercourse with our fellowmen we could not remember a single occasion when human voice had asked us who is dowd we turned from the puff with a suspicion that our own state with regard to the particular question did not widely differ from the experiences of the rest of our fellowcountrymen either in society or out of it in justice to the author we must say that his book in no waystands in needof dishonest praise it is so sure of receiving a liberal amount of unbought eulogy that those who are responsible for the success of its voyage through the shoals and quicksands of circulating libraries may confidently decline the aid of flatterers the papers are cheerful brilliant articles on a few of those light and not important topics in which the clever idlers of cultivated society find their principal amusement of continental life as it may be seen by observant tourists through the windows of fashionable hotels mr cornelius odowd gives some clever pictures and occasionally he sketches national character with a erecision and delicacy that induce us to regard im as one who has lived in foreign countries for higher ends than mere pastime his paper on italian traits and characteristics is admirable  and his essay on  adventurers and his sketch of  r n f the great chevalier dindustrie of our day will cause much hearty laughter and lessen the number and success of that numerous body of english swindlers who prey on the simplicity of foreign innkeepers and the credulity of british tourists indeed every paper in the collection will bear a second reading besides perfect command of his pen mr cornelius odowd displays judgement and tact never found in like degree in an untried writer well aware that in these busy and frivolous days workers have little time and idlers no humour for grave moral treatises he plies his readers liberally with anecdote and satire assuming his drollest aspects and making his brightest jests at the moments when he is most anxious to give profitable counsel for the greater part his illustrative stories are old tales familiar to all who have dined with the witty conversationalists of the departing generation  but his mode of producing an old mot is so thoroughly artistic that we could imagine ourselves laughing over joe millers drowsy witticisms if cornelius odowd edited them with his peculiar piquancy habitual narrators of timeworn tales who are guilty ol the common error of expanding their good stories in the belief that by overlaying an anecdote with new phrases they can draw attention from the antiquity or feebleness of its point would do well to take a lesson in their not lofty art from this new master of colloquial narration who employs words with equal discernment and parsimony and takes every opportunity to flatter his readers sagacity by allowing them to pick up the pearl which he has thrown before them and to complete the story which he has intentionally left not quite finished perhaps the paper in which the art of the storyteller is seen to best advantage is the sketch entitled a friend of giobertis this little piece is in its way a perfect gem of humour and cunning touch and though it takes up scarcely twenty minutes of the readers time it is a work of prose fiction that would reward the labour of any dramatic writer who should put it properly on the stage thc following passage from  the decline of whistthe most whimsical and wrongheaded of all the writers drolleriesmay be taken as j a fair sample of his style the late cabinet of lord derby contained some good players two of the secretaries of state j were actually fine players and one of them adds whist to accomplishments which would have made their possessor an admirable crichton if genius had not elevated him into a far loftier category than crichton belongs to rechberg plays well and likes his game but be is in whist as are all a j germans a thorough pedant i remember an inci  dent of his whistlife sufficiently amusing in its i way though in relation the reader loses what to myself is certainly the whole pungency of the j  story i mean the character and nature of the per j son who imparted the anecdote to me and who is about the most perfect specimen of that selfpossese sion which we call coolness the age we live in can s boast of i own that in a very varied and somey  what extensive experience of men in many coune  trie i never met with one who so completely v  fulfilled all the requisites of temper manner face h courage and selfreliance which make of a human ir  being the most unabashable and unemotional creal8  ture that walks the earth i tell the story as nearly jx  as i can as he related it to me i used to play a good  deal with rechberg said he and took pleasure in worrying him fer he was a great purist in his play x  and was outraged with anything that could not be a  sustained by an authority in fact each game was d followed by a discussion of full half an hour to the s  intense mortification of the other players though r j very amusing to me and offering me large oppor1 tunity to irritate and plague the austrian one d evening after a number of these discussions in r j which rechberg had displayed an even unusual y warmth and irritability 1 found myself opposed to him in a game the interest of which had drawn around us a large assembly of spectatorswhat the french designate as la alarie towards the conclusion of the game it was my turn to lead and i played a card which so astounded the austrian minister that he laid down his cards upon the n  table and stared fixedly at me  in all my expeys rience of whist said he deliberately i never ee  saw the equal of thatof what asked i southeast  of the card you have jubt played rejoined he it is not merely that such play violates every principle of the game but it actually stultifies all your own combinations i think differently count said i  i maintain that it is good play and i abide by it let us decide it by a wager said hein what waythus we shall leave the question to the galerie you shall allege what you deem to bethe reasons for your play and they shall decide if they accept them as valid i agree what will you betten napoleons twenty fifty five hundred if you like   cried he warmly i shall say ten you dont like losing and i dont want to punish you too heavily  there is the jury sir said he haughtily  make your casethe wager is this said i that to win i shall satisfy these gentlemen that for the card i played i had a sufficient and good reason yesmy reason was this theni looked into your hand i pocketed his ten napoleons but thoy were the last i won of him indeed it took a month before he got over the shock  hiving been generous to cornelius odowd we must now be just to the reader a hint will suffice to indicate that the essayist is not without his faults we could point to more than one place where his rifle misses fire when it is maliciously pointed at an adversary two or three of the later papers are very inferior to though best chapters of the volume on climbing boys for instance signally exposes the writer to the fine thread of the critics lash the whole fun of thu essay consists in an overstrained comparison of sweeps and statesmen  it would says the writer be temptingbut i resist the temptationto show how many points of resemblance unite themhow each works in the dark in a small narrow confined sphere without views or outlet how the tendency of each is to scratch his way upwards and gain the top caring wonderfully little how black and dirty the process has made him a volume might be written on the subtle artifices adopted to keep them littlethe browbeatings the insults the crushing cruelties the spare diet intermixed with occasional stimulants the irregular hours and the heat and confinement of the sphere they work in still nature is stronger than all these crafty contrivances the little sweep will grow into the big sweep and the small undersec will scratch his way up to the cabinet mr cornelius odowd is a clever fellow and boasts that he has  been everywhereeaten of everythingseen everything but notwithstanding his modest assurance we are inclined to suspect that he has never seen a smarts chimney sweeping machine and has never carefully perused the acts passed in her present majestys reign for the better regulation of the chimneysweeping trade anyhow it will comfort him in his lively sorrow for our poor little chimneysweeps to be toldon authoritythat o viet 1840forbids master sweeps to take apprentices who are under sixteen years of age and that since july 11842 the law has permitted no person

creative genius in the essayist the subject about which he writes may be comparatively insignificant but he depends for success upon the beauty of his thoughts the arrangement of his periods the

some otablke books of tj4e mo1n4th the history of sir richard calmady the history of sir richard calmady is told in 6i8 pages by a woman of genius who not only can write but who has nerved herself to say things which are usually unsaid and to deal with a theme which with all deference to the authoress i think she had much better have abstained from handling there are only three characters to speak of in the booksir richard calmady his mother and his cousin the other figures which crowd the stage are of no account and of the three the cousin mme helen de vallorbes is the most conspicuous and the least pleasant it is not a pleasant story at all and those who wish for entertainment and amusement had better avoid it it is a study of life under morbid and unnatural conditions in this respect it suggests reminiscences of  lhomme qui rit for the hero is a man blighted from birth with the curse of physical defect in  notre dame victor hugo also touches upon the same gruesome theme but lucas malet deals with this matter in her own fashion the story is cry simple the history of sir richard calmady begins some months before he was born his father having his leg smashed by a horse in his stable died under theamputationthat followed his legswcrecutoffat the knee in the days of charles ii the illegitimate son of sir thomas calmady an ancestor of sir richard had also lost his nether extremities his unnatural father having driven over the child as they came from the church where he had been marrying another woman the deserted mistress with the mangled and dying child in her arms had cursed the calmadys to the sixth and seventh generation declaring that as the judgement of his perfidy and lust no son of brockhurstthe calmady estateshould reach the lifelimit set by the psalms and die quiet and christianly in his bed untila fatherless babe to the birth shall have come of brother or sister shall he have none but redgold hair and eyes of blue and a foot that will never know stocking or shoe if he opens his purse to the lamenters cry then the woe shall lift and be laid for aye some months after his fathers death richard calmady wvas born when to the horror of the doctor and his mother it was discovered that as the result of his fathers accident the child was born without any legs but with feet fastened on to the end of his thighs his mother lady calmady who is painted in ideal colours as the most marvellous and devoted of mothers was filled with profound remorse at the effect which her own emotion has produced upon her child she dedicates herself to him and brings him up bravely sir richard himself is represented as almost human perfection cut short at the kneehandsome stately wellformed possessing in every respect an ideal physique with the exception of his shorn extremities the result of the feet being planted on to the extremities of the thighs rendered it impossible for him to be furnished with artificial limbs hence he could only hobble about in a more or less hideous fashion the first half of the book is devoted to a description of how the poor boy thus marred from birth grows up and suffers keenly at every turn from those slights from which   the history of sir richard calniady by lucas malet london metnuen and co 6i8 pages price 6s all his mothers loving care could not shield him his first love affair when little more than a boy was a passion of great devotion for his cousin the heroine and villain of the piece as children they had met when she had spoken jeeringly to his mother of the poor cripples deformity his mother blazing with indignation had flung the child from her path and ordered her to leave the house the little girl had fallen against the wall and inflicted a scar upon her forehead which caused her to regard lady calmady with undyinghatred in her childish wrath she vowed to be revenged and she kept her word returning afterwards when she had made a more or less unhappy marriage she fascinated sir richard who placed his fortune at her disposal with a knightly chivalry declaring that it was all he could do his mother nearly breaks her heart over the lads passion for his cousin but it passes and they agree to marry him to a little english girl of title not so much from any love on his part as from a desire to perpetuate the family and that he may have a son the girl recoils at the last moment from marrying the truncated suitor and sir richard thereupon maddened and despairing determined to have his fling and go to the devil he declares he will go the common way of common coarsegrained sensual men and be of this world worldly he saysi am going to have just all that my money and position and even this wild deformityfor by god i will use that too  what people wont give for love they will give

lust my imagination has been stimulated into rather dangerous activity by the prenatal insult put upon me and now that i have emancipated myself i propose to apply my imagination practically he is as good as his word and he embarks upon a wild career of debauchery and unnatural and morbid vice in the midst of it all he still cherishes love for helen his cousin whom in spite of the wreck of all his other gods he continues to cherish in a secret temple of his own as the one pure woman in the world in reality she is a veritable messalina although as the authoress says in a sentence of almost unique coarseness in modern novels the artist was at least as present in her as the whore and to the delineation of this great courtesan with fine aesthetic appreciations and inevitable animality lucas malet devotes herself with a minutenessof analysis much more frequently found in french than in english novels for some reason or other lucas malet appears to be fascinated by this shepanther of a woman she paints her minutely in almost every phase of emotion she describes the woman with the licentious city of naples as a background deliberately laying her snares and completing her arrangements to lure her cousin to his undoing it is not often that in english fiction there is a picture drawn at full length and in vivid colours of the way of a strange woman with the man whom she has marked down for her victim and what makes the thing all the more horrid is the emphasis which lucas malet lays upon the effect of physical deformity as an incentive to sensual desire in the midst of a scene in which helen was plying all her arts in order to fire calmadys blood sir richard had to move his positionshe stared fascinated by that cruel spectacle for the instant transformation of the apparently tall and conspicuously wellfavoured courtly gentleman just now sitting at table with her into this shuffling longarmed crippled dwarf was at first utterly incredible then portentous then by virtue of its very monstrosity absorbing and to her adorable whetting appetite as veritable famine might chastity became to her more than ever absurd a culpable waste of her own loveliness of sensation of emotion a sin against those vernal influences working in this generous nature surrounding her and working in her own blood all the primitive instinct of her womanhood called aloud in her that she must wedmust wed and the strident voice of the great painted city coming up to her urgent incessant carried the same message as did the radiant sea whose white lips kissed the indented coastline as though pale and hungry with love while the nan before her by his very abnormality and a certain secretness inevitable in that heightened her passion he was to her of all living men most desirable so that she must win him and hold him must see and know of course the inevitable result follows she held this man in the hollow of her hand by right divine of beauty wit and the manifold seductions of her richly endowed personality this of her many loves was the crown and the climax as the adulteress hunts for the precious life so this lithe shepanther tracked down her prey and triumphed without remorse in the satisfaction of her revenge and the consummation of her desire like her prototype in the book of proverbs she ate and drank and said  i have done no evil it is very different with her victim calmady who had wilfully trampled under foot all canons of morality and was shocked back into virtue by the sudden destruction of his last ideal  the last of mv selfmade gods he told her has indeed gone overboard he fled from the scene of his undoing took refuge on board his yacht but venturing out feverstricken to attend the opera he was again tracked down by his conqueror who came to him in his box and vowed her determination never to leave him  richard she said very softly laying her hand lightly upon his thighi forgive all i am not satisfied with loving i will come with you i will stay with you i will be faithful to you yes yes even that your love is unlike any other it is unique as you yourself are unique i want more of it  her lips were parted in naughty laughter and then not without a shrinking of quick horror richard beheld the soul in herthat being of lovely proportions exquisitely formed in every part yet black as the foul liquid lanes between the hulls of the money ships dowvn in naples harbourstep delicately in between those parted lips returning whence it came he refused to go with her whereupon she summoned a former lover into the box who struck richard again and again across the face with his metalbuttoned gloves calmady tried to strike him and fell heavily stunning himself as his temples struck the lower step of the descent from the back of the box the man kicked calmady as he lay asking  dear madame are you sufficiently avenged is it enough helen expressed herself satisfied and the two went out into the blackness of the dark night the third part of the book describes the regeneration of sir richard calmady the fever possessed him and he came for a time near to the door of death he was nursed back by his mother who rejoiced to welcome back the prodigal who had found the husks which the swine did eat so very bitter to his taste sir richards repentance was genuine and final his mother had the satisfaction of finding for him an excellent wife from whom he conceals nothing either of his deformities or of his lapses from the straight path her acceptance of him is characteristic and somewhat original  for heavens sake she said  dont take me out of pity i would never forgive you there is a good deal of us both one way and another and we should give each other a hell of a time if i was in love and you were not butshe put her hand on the peak of that very ugly saddle again but if you do care here i am i am yours body and soul marry me she said having made up her mind to accept him she found that his crippling was dearer to her than any other mans wholeness and his wrongdoings dearer than any other mans virtue what wve wonder wvould people think if a man were to say such a thing to a woman like helen everything goes so well that in the last page he tells his mother he is thankful that she brcught him into the world even as he was which was good for the most perfect of mothers to hear speaking of the book as a whole no one can deny its ability or the nerve of its authoress  but whether it is a book which makes altogether for edification is a question upon which readers will

in silk attire new novels by william black 3 vols tinsley brothers allowing for the improbability which lies at the root of this novel and which leads to some minor faults of the same kind we say at once that in silk attire is thoroughly pleasant and readable marked by much and varied cleverness mr blacks plot is not in itself a new one the unavoidable rivalry between two girls who are in love with and are almost equally loved by the same man has often been treated but in the present instance the contrast is not so strongly felt as usual both girls are worthy both are unselfish each seems to wish the other to win it must have given mr black great pain to have to cut the knot if we cannot fully sympathise with him that is owing to the way in which the opening improbability is brought back again at the closeand has an air of bringing down the curtain perhaps mr black would urge in excuse that with an actress for his heroine stage effect is allowable he would add further that his heroines mother was an actress and that what is bred in the bone will never come out in the flesh the episode of annie brunels birth and infancy which serves as a prologue to the story has of course been put in for the bearing it has on this side of her character and makes the transformationscene at the end less abrupt but even this does not reconcile us to it wholly and with all mr blacks skill we never quite get over the beginning and the end of his story all we can say in their favour is that the author never loses sight of them they have their effect on the whole conduct of the plot if we forget them now and then and if we enjoy the book most when we do forget them mr black has not set us the example he is consistent throughout and is alike true to what is natural and what is unnatural the faults of the story swell the success of the artist when we dismiss from our minds this aspect of the novel we find that in other respects there is a want of absolute freshness and originality pleasant as the characters are and clearly as they are drawn they are only variations on the old types count schbnstein for instance the man who has made a fortune in business and bought a german title without being able to speak the language is merely new in his surroundings we think mr black ought to do better ought to be able to strike out something new in itself instead of contenting himself with placing things in a new light so too mr anerley the father of the hero is intended to be a likeness of the modern materialist and he is great in the scandal he causes to the clergyman of the parish in the difficult theories he inflicts on womankind in the goodnatured sarcasm which is infused into all his words as naturally as smoke is breathed from between the lips that sustain a pipe mr anerley is capitally drawn and we delight in his paradoxes  only we know him already we made his acquaintance in days when materialism had not yet laid its icy clutch upon him when he still went to church or was kept at home by a slight return of his old complaint when he did not suggest that it was a sign of imperfect development in a scotchman not being born with a macintosh here again we think mr black might have done better we have no such objection to make to his two heroines of the two we prefer dove anerley partly because she is more complete in herself partly because mr black so cruelly sacrifices her the change which is wrought in the character of annie brunel when she conies off the stage and mixes with other people is in some sense significant of her part in the novel we know more of her as an actress than as a woman yet mr black professes to show her to us as a woman and only to tell us what she did as an actress we must take her great artistic powers and success more or less upon trust and if they seem to us exaggerated we have no means of testing mr blacks account of them but the woman is brought nearer to us and we are called upon to judge her from our natural point of view here we confess dove anerley shows to greater advantage though mr black will hardly see it he may not take it as a compliment to be told that his minor characters do him yet more credit but we are far from intending this to be a censure the distinction that may be drawn between his fulllengths and his miniatures is that in the one we miss either novelty or power in the other we are able to do justice to cleverness and observation when mr black sketches the surface of life the daily occurrences when he pictures the retired teabroker acting as country gentleman in kent and still more when the counts foot is on the soil with which he bought his title nothing can be pleasanter the days shooting in the black forest is a perfect scene what with count schonsteins bad german and his general awkwardness what with the fine figure of the tall keeper and will anerleys accident our interest is fully excited and we share the regrets of all the party at the necessity ofa return to england but there are scenes in england which are worthy of being named by the side of this one and english characters by no means inferior to the counts faithful but unintelligible germans all that concerns mr anerley himself is as good as all that concerns count schonstein with the same abatement as to the principal characters and with one grave exception the ruin of the anerleys and mr anerleys last interview with the count are a blot on the novel and the more so that they are alien to the usual bent of mr blacks ability at least no other part of the story can be called poor whatever else may be said against it  in silk attire a novel by william black in three volumes tinley brothers a strange wild story of our own times very subtly told a young marquis marries an actress of great talent and high popularity she does not care to face his noble friends and relations he srinks from introducing her to them so they go abroad avoid english society and settle at thun wheu their only child is four yea old the husband suddenly tyres of his bnient and longs for london life pleads business takes leave of his wife affectionately and hurries away sending his man of business after the lapse of a few weeks to offer her whatever income she may desire she covers her broken heart with a mantle of pride and refuses to accept more money than will suffice to carry her to new york where she resolves to resume her profession for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  those whom god had joined  become utter strangers to each other but after a few years the marquis lying on his deathbed repents of the wrong he has done his wife and makes the only reparation now in his power by bequeathing to her and their daughter the whole of his property his executors who hardly knew of her existence have much difficulty in discovering her abode for her theatrical reputation is not now worldwide as it had been in her early days the old fire had gone out when trouble fell upon her when the lawyer waits upon her to announce her good fortune he is astounded by her renunciation of the proffered wealth he begs her to reconsider her decision urging the advantage to her daughter of being placed in the position of an english lady she replies that her daughter has been brought up in total ignorance of her birth and thinks it best that she should remain so she feels acutely how muuch happier her own life would have been had she never passed beyond the bounds of her profession and desires that her daughter should know nothing of the outer world however she will give her the lawyers address and tell her to apply to him should she ever find herself in distress this introduction to the main story for it is the daughter who is the real heroine is improbable in fact and questionable in taste it seems to us a mistake to have opened the book with it calculated as it is to produce an unfavourable impression on the readers mind it would have been better first to have excited an interest in the wonderful annie brunel and then to have gratified the readers curiosity by accounting in some measure for the strongly developed features of her remarkable character in telling the strange story of her birth and the sad tale of her mothers sufferings and wrongs let the reader open the book at the fourth chapter and he will find the orphan girl in london at the zenith of her fame as an actress her juliet is a complete success and we will venture to say as to our authors conception of the character that it is certain be cannot have seen the part so played we must unfortunately go back l to theatrical traditions for such an impersonation of shakespeares betwitching creation l suddenly there was an extraordinary commotion throughout i the house and a burst of that fine strong thunderous music which artists love to hearand then dove saw advance a girlishlooking creature with a calm somewhat pale and interesting face i and beautiful black hair she was only girlish in the slightness i of her figure there was an artistic completeness in her motions and a selfpossession in her bearing which gave her something of a queenly look she wore a magnificent white satin dress the train of which lay in splendid masses behind her and down over this white and gold fell a black lace veil partly hiding the rich i hair and enclosing the clear beautiful dark face dove was spellbound by that face it somehow suggested italy to her and blue skies and music and the passiona artistic warmth of the south nor was the illusion destroyed by the low chestvoice with which the girl replied to the questions of mother and from that moment dove thought no more of mliss brunel and wills friend 1 she saw only juliet and followed her sad story with an aching heart anl trembling lip during the matchless balconyscene will saw this intense sympathetic emotion growing upon the girl i believe it is con e sidered to be the proper thing for young ladies to be able to turn l round and smile compassionately to each other when the traic sadness on the stage is making the women in the pit sob bitterly and raising great lumps in the throats of the mei it is a pretty accomplishment in its way and may be indicative of other l iualities which these young persons arc accused of possessing doves emotional tendencies had never been educated however  and in this balconyscene as i say size watched the lovers with a painful interest which wrote its varying story every moment on her face the theatre was still as death the scarcelyuttered l tendernessesof juliet were heard ts distinctly as if they had been i breathed into ones ear and the yes of the audience frank in  the trembling lights and shadows ot her girlish passion with an unconscious delight and admiration elie abandonment of her affection the reluctant declaratioirs the coy shrinkings and piteous playful tender apologies were so blcnded as to niakc the n scene an artistic marvel and dove sat laughin maist like to greet as the old scotch song says tnii cd she scarcely knew t whether to laugh or cry with the delightthe absolute delight which this piece of true art gave her and wheti at last juliet had forced herself to the partingtis almost morning i would have thee gonc r and yet no farther than a wart nis bird t who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twist gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty  i when lingeringly and sadly she had withdrawn from the t balcony dove rose suddenly and with a halfchoked sob in her voice sad  oh will i should like so much to see herandxd  kies her she had nearly said but thinking it might be ridiculous she stopped  its against the rules dove said will with a smile  be sides that isnt miss brunel youve been looking at tat s b juliet both are very nice ladies bus they are quite unlike eah other a  a a  just as the curtain fell upon the scene in friar lawrences cell at the end of the second act mr melton conducted dove and will down a tortuous little stone stair into a narrow passage from which they entered into the wings a noisy and prolonged reca1 was thundering throughout the house and miss brunel was being led on to the stage by romeo to receive renewed plaudits when x she returned and passed under the glare of the jets in one of the 3 entrances will went forward to shake hands with her  i have to congratulate you again he said  thank you she said simply there had been a pleased smile of welcome in her eyes when r they met and yet it seemed to him that there was a strange intense expression in her look which was not natural to it once or twice before he had seen her in the same circumstances and invariably this unconscious mesmeric intensity was present in her i eyes he explained it to himself by supposing that the emotional idealism of her assumed character had not quite died out of her i yet then she turned and saw dove standing with mr melton will r begged to introduce his sister and the brief ceremony was sufficiently singular for a moment the dark lambent eyes of miss brunel were fixed upon the fair young girl with a sort of s hesitating lookan inquiring apprehensive look which will never forgot then all at once she frankly extended her band l dove a little frightened approached and shook hands with her  mr anerley has spoken to me about you said annie brunel i and dove was conscious that the darkhaired girl before her knew 3 her secret how singular it was to hear herself addressed in those low rich tones which a few minutes ago were addrcssing romeo in the r moonlight dove almost felt herself enchanted and could have ri believed at that moment that she herself belonged to the old sad e sweet play which seems to contain everything that was ever uttered about mans love and womans devotion e i must go down to my dressingroom now said miss brunel f to dove  will you come with me if you are curious to see r the place  i will send some one round with you to your box afterwards  will saw that dove would like to go so he settled the proposal by telling her not to be in miss brunels way and then he and 0 melton returned to the front of the house i while she is on the stage she ceases to be annie brunel  and becomes for the time the character she represents 3but this heavensent actress is mortal she loses her heart i and as the woman developes the actress dies out she begins to feel a loathing for her profession she has become lselfconscious she sees the people who are staring at her i she resolves to quit the stage and then there comes the ivery serious question how to live it is only as a last resource that she applies to the lawyers whose address her mother had confided to her the reader who has followed her thus far who has rejoiced with her in her professional triumphs who has pitied her misplaced love and felt for her in her distresses will be quite prepared to sympathise with her in her prosperity and admire the true nobility of her character equal even to the severe test of sudden unexpected and almost unimaginable wealth indeed the tale would have been more believable had the property been less enormous the rank of her father rather less exalted the ideal actress is admirably contrasted with the real actress a very pleasant kindhearted little lady a staunch friend in adversity though at times addicted to frivolity the lover is a welldrawn sketch of a thorough englishman very well meaning but rather weak in purpose who being engaged to a very tender sweet girl allows himself to fall desperately in love with the brilliant actress and has not the tact to keep his secret his efforts to bind up the broken heart are very commendable but the great truth that it is a mischief past repair is very forcibly and pathetically told the picture of his family circle is a truthful home scene of english country life and life in london amongst theatrical people is admirably sketched there ale pleasant views upon the rhine with its quaint old cities and majestic breadth of waters ruined towers and vineclad hills and some highly picturesque and characteristic scenes in the black forest where the vulgar millionaire of the tale who persecutes poor annie with his addresses has bought an estate which gives him the title of count his attentions to miss brunel are very far from being so disinterested as he strives to make them appear when he urges his suit with the promise that s she shall walk in silk attire for he happens to know who she really is and has a clear intention of claiming her property if he can only cajole her into becoming his wife the pretensions and the soliloquies of this purseproud retired teabroker are very absurd yet we cannot call the character overdrawn the many touches of his apparent generosity in which a reference to the promotion of one or other of his pet schemes may always be detected are very skilfully thrown in and his notion that all the world is bound to do his bidding and help forward his plans is a clever exemplification of the views of many a prosperous mana persuasicf which has probably aided him in achieving his prosperity we wish the book the success it deserves it possesses much originality it is agreeably written the characters are thoroughly lifelike and carefully thought outcertainly the heroine is almost too good to be true we have spoken of her as an ideal for though such an artiste may not now exist it is an accepted fact that such have been and there certainly is no reason why so perfect an actress should not be as perfect a lady as noble as generous as sensitive as truehearted as lovable as teachable as pure we much prefer the creation of so glorious a being to the representation of a mere ordinary mortal those who are not of our way of thinking may find in dove anerley a young lady more suited to their taste  in silk attirm the three first chapters of this story which form a sort of prologue introduce us to annie napier a distinguished actress who while in the height of her fame is wooed and won and married by harry ormond marquis of knottingley who carries his wife to switzerland dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her or otherwise make her life miserable after living with his wife several years on the shore of a swiss lake during which time a child is born to them harry ormond takes a longing to revisit england which he does leaving behind him both wife and child whom he never again sees arriving in england he thinks it better or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better not to return to his wife any more but to live apart from her the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful marchioness of knottingley declining a separate maintenance which he offers her the marchioness retires to new york where under the name of brunel she once more goes upon the stage to which she also trains her daughter annie brunel whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother at the death of the marquis ten years after his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by  acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property of this however she refuses to avail herself choosing rather to live by her profession and she arranges with the english lawyers that even her daughter who knows nothing of her real rank shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality when she may learn her position and claims thus far the prologue the story then follows the fortunes of annie brunel the young american actress who has captivated the heart of london by the brilliancy of her genius we get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the playthe party consisting of mr melton the manager miss brunel with several other members of the company a number of critics aparvenu count the graf von slchonstein will anerley a friend of the count and others who figure in the tale this is among the first glimpses we get of annie brunelslight in figure and somewhat pale and dark there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features and a stateliness in her gestures which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey they were eyes under those long eyelashes capable of a great sadness and yet they were not sad there seemed to play around the beautiful intellectual face a bright superficial unoonsciou activity and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her for the rest she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists and there ended in a faint line of blue and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it the artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of for she wams an arist one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage  for once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter meltabandonment of her impersonations p on the stage she was no longer mistress of herself her eyes deepened until they were almost black her face was stirred with the white light of peasion and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore when the sudden intensity died down when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres she seemed to have come out of a trance not a trace remained of that ore and those intonations which were the result of uncomsious cration her eyes resumed their serene happy indifference her face its pleased childlike expression swif bive dexterous she was full of all sorts of genial marry activities that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dreamlife she led elsewhere this is annie brunel the actress and unknown to herself marchionese of knottingley holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance some of which soon force themselves into fact for it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever the story of her parentage is known to count von schonstein who has it from his brother a member of the firm which is the depository of the knottingleybrunel romance and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play having met mis brunel before in ia sin atty a novel b wilim bla author of i love or mariage thm vols losdom  tiniey i america he renews his acquaintance with her in england and with the knowledge of her parentage resolves to marry her if he can expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility one can feel of course that the count cannot be the man and as the result proves in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes he fails but the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness but because a better man is bound to succeed and that man as the prophetic instinct perceives can be nobody but will anerley yet one is puzzled at this for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation in the first place there seems no necessity for it then although as annie brunel and will become acquainted they grow to like each other liking is not exactly loving besides she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady a distant relation of his own dove anerley who has been brought up in his own family down at st marykirby in pleasant kent in spite however of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary though one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that somehow the destinies of will anerley and annie brunel are steadily converging towards each other and will finally become one in the mean time there remains the difficulty of dove anerley whose portrait is thus suggested it was one of those rare faoes which tantalise you in the eryact of admiring them there was nothing in it of that mature vigorous definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman but a tender uncertainty a halfsuggested and shrinking loveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features it was not that the girl samed unwell or in any degree fragile but simply that one in looking at her face could not help regretting that her loveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes this is the lady who has been the companion of will anerleys youth whom he loves and to whom he has been spiritually if not formally affianced long before he encounters annie brunel but that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change in physical and mental structure will who is the son of a country gentleman is a thorough englishman and is above treachery and deception he does not deceive and desert dove anerleybe does not even cease to love her but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound inspired by the young actress who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentleminded dove it all seems natural and inevitableand as inevitable too that annie brunel should fall in love with will anerley the two are thrown much together during a trip to count schdnsteins residence in the black forest in germany and on wills return to england dove notices the change in manner and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause yet as if foreboding what the end is to be she hardly resents the change in her lover a change also comes over annie brunel remembering the teaching of her mother she conceals her passion for will feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession and even when their mutual affection is confesed they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of dove anerley whom wim is bound in honour to marry the impossible game of suppression goes on for some time when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress the power of genius seems to die within her in the light of her strong passion the idea of a higher life dawns upon her she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her and leaves it almost penniless if not friendless at this time too the anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodgedan event which will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest worse than this to them is the fact that dove having somehow been smitten with cold is now dying of consumption suddenly in the midst of their wellborne distress fortune shines upon them from an unknown place this is the cause of itmiss brunel having at length been reduced to her last shilling and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer does so and there and then discovers that she is the daughter and ole heiressofthemarquisotknottingley although for a time quite stunned by the revelation annie brumnel soon masters the situation and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the anerleys but dove is dyingend from death there is no escape and she knows it but she sewe eager to get mrried to will before she d joa to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife for this purpose she gets will to buy a wedding ring and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words we two loving each other very dearly write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife and as a pledge of our constant love this however remains qnsigned and meanwhile dove getting gradually worse desires to see annie brunel whom will finds in her poor lodging attired in a simple black dress for her great secret is still undivulged i was going to me dove she said when i heard

irish idylls by jane barlow hodder  stoughton the comparison between miss barlow and miss wilkins is a very obvious one for what one is to the humble new englander the other is to the dweller in the bogs of connaught each author reveals to us the life and habit of thought of a class hitherto but little known and eachpossesses the magic of clothing humdrum trifles with interest and charm but as the new englander and the wild irishman differ much from one anothernot only in way of life but in habit of thoughtit follows that the resemblance between the two writers is the result of many differences the new englander is shrewd protestant and struggling the connaught peasant idle dreamy and resigned and as each author has the power of making us live the life of her puppets and enter into their way of thought it follows that anything like imitation is impossible the irish idylls all occur in the desolate hamlet of lisconnel among cottars huddled together on a low hill or knockaun in the bog in a destitution never far removed from actual starvation  the hopes and cares of the inhabitants centre mainly in the little greydyked fields which make a plaid pattern on the hillside and along a meagre belt beneath and this renders it the more regretable that their most prolific and certain crop should be such an unremunerative one stones upon stones scattered broadcast by some malignant hundredhanded and perennially working up through the thin soil in mockery of tenfingered attempts to collect and keep them under those looselybuilt boundary walls which intersect so frequently that the bit of land looks as if a coarselymeshed net had been flung over it fail utterly to exhaust the supply in each diminutive field a great cairn of them is piled up as big sometimes as the tabin to which it belongs and still the husband fri man comes on them at every turn  every he where he can read written large an answer to an his demand for bread th still the people cling

meaningless mysteries  a meagre fieldfleck and a ramshackle shanty on the hills wan l grey slope or the lip of the blackoozing morass is scarcely an ideal earthly paradise yet it may be at least the site of the only one that can appear possible to him  should a sequel of calamity such as jobs overtake him sweeping away his flocks and herds and children no eventual doubling of his live stock could console him  and as for the ten new sons and daughtersthey would be a failure indeed the working of the irish peasant mind has seldom been indicated more clearly than in this passage and the thoughtful speculative turn of bogland brains reveals itself in a dozen racy conversations which the reader will find only too short though they are too long for quotation in character drawing miss barlow succeeds best with mature women old mrs kilfoyle the widdy mgurk and herself are admirable sketches and mad bell with her face  like a wizened lemon looking shrewdly up at you is a delightful creation but the girls are less living and the menwith perhaps the exception of poor larry sheridanare types rather than individuals like the characters in a modern play but in spite of this defect and of the authors excessive fondness for adjectives the irish idylls are delightful reading and afford a truer insight into irish peasant character and ways of life and thought than any hook that it has been our fortune to read for a long time  irish idylls i imagine that as this book goes the round of the reviews it will become a trite thing to call miss barlow an irish barrie like him she has found her book waiting her in a little and humble place of the earth like him she has the delicate observation that is the harvest of a quiet eye she has his gifts of tenderness of dignity of true and simple pathos of sympathy that comes by love like him she has a fine and beautiful vocabulary and a style that makes pictures to us irish she is more welcome than barrie can be to the scotch we are so long awaiting our real irish novelist while mr barrie comes in the line of succession to great men who have made the world intimate with scotland and scottish folk we have had no such interpreters carleton was too shapeless and too melancholy miss edgeworth despite her genius was oldmaidish and restricted the banims and gryphon did but piecemeal work at best miss lawless in our own day writes of the same sunless country and grey lives that miss barlow treats here but her  grania leaves one an impression of a solitary page of the story a single lonely figure desolate on a low shore amid a waste of waters there is many a lisconnel in ireland at the back of the bogs or  the back of god speed but who else could make of it not a human document but a human book fluttering whose pages we run all the gamut of emotions we have here the human tragedy in such pathetic things as one too many or  herself miss barlow has the gift of tears in verse or prose and as one could scarcely read th old master to take one of her poems without a  irish idylls by jane barlow london hodder and stoughton catch in the throat so it is not easy to be dryeyed over poor larry sheridan and his homely tragedy or over mrs odriscoll and the children going to america but what good honest pathos it is none of the unwholesome things that take you by the throat with a stony horror like those that stalk out of ibsen and the russians irish idylls leaves us more human and kindly when it has wrung our hearts then the humour is truly delightful what a child only we see too little of him is jimmy kilfoyle and what mingled humour and pathos is the warp and woof of all their lives one gets to know them mrs doyne and stacy dear little mrs kilfoyle and mr mcgurk and all the other worthies of lisconnel as if one were going in and out every day among them the humanity is not starved olt of lisconnel it is an innocent little community indeed in which the only thing starved out seems to be vice miss barlow sees not only the primitive lives but the lonely country and the wild skies that seem a part of it she has superb descriptive bits which paint us pictures as finely as any sky painter or painter of moors who works in the legitimate medium i wish i had space to quote the skies that flash into her pictures fixed for us in her nervous and fine english it would not be easy to better this all at once something happened in the western sky it was as if some vast tentrope had suddenly been snapped for the dark riftless cloudcanopy seemed not so much to abruptly rise as to actually recoil back with a swing up from the horizons verge and ere one had realised that it had begun to lift it was flying eastward scudding in festoons and trails and shreds or furled into rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering blasts i believe  irish idylls will be an irish classic i have read every line of it with increasing delight and am glad messrs hodder and stoughton have bound it so substantially not like your mushrooms of a season miss barlow writes a little more from the outside than does barrie this is shown by her occasional slip in the matter of the brogue though she has much mended since  bogland studies another matter in which she does not see far is that in such lives as these religion would be a far more potent element than she makes it katharine tynan  irish ways by jane barlow illus trated by warwick goble allen  sons miss jane barlows reputation as a writer of irish tales or rather irish sketches of character is too high to require any recommendation from us this new instalment has all the merits of her previous volumes but it does not manifest any advance in her art the style is finished and shows evidence of high education and long familiarity with classical and modern literature hence it is remarkable that she should confine herself to so narrow a field where that large learning can show itself only indirectly and where a love of nature and an insight into peasant character form the whole matter of the volume there is but little plot in her stories  the elements of broad farce and of wild tragedy are not there but we find endless quiet humour and deep appreciation of the virtues and foibles of one of the most attractive peasantries of europe the opening chapter  ourselves and our island gives a summary of the complexities of irish character very similar to the larger but not so subtle treatment by mr lynd which we noticed on october 23rd but when we penetrate into the book we find that two or three leading types which other books treat at great length are ignored by miss barlow we say ignored for it is inconceivable that she does not know them the first is the roman catholic priest and indeed the protestant clergyman whose influence on the life of the poor is so great yet so disputed there is occasionally a priest in her backgrounds but as a character she will not tolerate him the same is the case with the local agitator and thirdly there is the gombeen man local moneylender who haunts every village and every market in poorer ireland and gives ample scope to the painter of irish life as for example to william carleton yet though this is the author who has most in common with miss barlow she omits these three types as carefully as the letters upon ireland are omitted from the published correspondence of queen victoria we can offer no clue to this negative feature in miss barlows irish stories but we must say that it limits her field and makes her gallery of local types smaller and more monotonous if she also omits the jackeen and the buckeen the apes of the squireen she would doubtless reply that she writes only about the very poor and only about the country poor who have exceptional manners no one knows better than miss barlow how to bring out this feature in her tales  and she paints the life and feelings of these indigent but refined peasants with a charm that has fascinated the reading public of our day her descriptions of the scenery of bogs and moors and of wild western coasts is often truly poetical indeed she allows herself the licence of french rather than english prose in this respect the beauties of bogland are by no means obvious yet no man who has travelled that sort of country deliberately as for example for sport will hesitate to acknowledge the truth and accuracy of her observation the writing down of dialect is always difficult some eminent irish novelists are very deficient in the power of hearing the sounds and catching the idioms such is not the case with miss barlow though we are not always in agreement with her we make the following suggestions as she surely professes to give the ordinary diction of western peasants and not their occasional use of strange words though the eastern irish speak of an awkward person as a thwart we do not remember the verb  to thwart in their use or with like limitation the verb  to question the irishman does not say  i question whether this is true but i doubt if it is so to be surprised  is also unusual though  surprizin  is common  and the pronunciation  scandeelious  for  scandlous  is new to us the irish know a spruce tree well enough but a spruce lad is a use of the adjective which is surely uncommon  should you suppose is also to be rejected  shall  and  should  being very unusual and replaced by  will  and  would the general impression which the english will draw from the book is that the western irish peasant is not the gay rollicking careless figure of angloirish fiction but rather a patient hardworking creature living in such squalor and gloom as to make his life a prolonged effort against despair miss barlows peasants represent the preceltic population often called firbolgs which was subdued by the invading celts and either exiled to the mountains and bogs of the west or reduced to the condition of churls who tilled the land for the tyrannous and ungrateful celtic swordsmen and their chiefs the hard treatment which the latter received from the english was probably a mere repetition of what had happened ten or fifteen centuries earlier when the celts were the invading conquerors it would be an interesting inquiry to trace the influences of this earlier stratum  probably pre  aryan  on the life of ireland but these are speculations regarding remote and forgotten causes which have drawn us away from the living pictures of today which are the object of this book we need hardly say in conclusion that we commend it strongly to our readers a word of praise should be added for the excellent illustrations of mr goble,history_contra

pawnee hero stories and folk  tales with notes on the origin customs and character of the pawnee people by g b grinnell to which is added a chapter on the pawnee language by john b dunbar nutt  blackfoot lodge tales the story of a prairie people by g b grinnell same publisher tne pawnee tribe ocaupied the banks of the platte river in nebraska where now stands the flourishing city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has several woodcut illustrations,history_contra

miss braddon had nothing to do the critics raved but aurora floyd was in demand at the shops we are not in a position to state how many stories of our authoress were cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair

find it a more or n unprofitable calling to glean in the districts off which mi bradlon has reaped a crop it would occur to us id reading the novel now before us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the composition of her later

  the english novel in the time of shakespeare tty j j jusserand translated from the french by elizabeth lee fisher unwin m jusseraxds little monograph on the english novel originally published in french some five years ago showed how much he could teach us about our own literature his researches are now presented to us in a revised and enlarged shape and the result is a contribution of permanent value to the history of elizabethan literature m jusserand has chosen ground that we ourselves have neglected but his explorations have not been superficial and we are inclined to think that future travellers in the same country will find little new information to supply and few erroneous impressions to correct with thoroughness as an investigator m jusserand combines a faculty of placing his results attractively before his readers and he has been fortunate in securing the assistance of miss elizabeth lee who has done her work of translation satisfactorily throughout miss lees english is always accurate and when it suggests a french idiom we appreciate the scholarly flavour of the rendering the book abounds in pertinent illustrations william rogerss faithful engraving of queen elizabeths portrait forms the frontispiece a view of burghley house exemplifies the richness of elizabethan architecture with which contemporary literature had much in common portraits of sir philip sidney and his sister wellselected plates from such works of imagination as topsoils  fourfooted beastes and  serpents examples of the illustrations employed in french seventeenth century romances all give a charm to the volume which the scholar will appreciate no less than the general reader the useful index deserves a word of praise m jusserand traces the sources of the novel even before the remote date of beowulf but he wisely avoids merely archaeological speculation and begins a detailed treatment of his subject with sir thomas malorys  morte darthur as everybody is aware caxton was the printer of this noble and joyous book but it is less generally known that this was only one of caxtons efforts as printer editor or translator to gratify his patrons insatiable taste for works of fiction the new forms of literature and the new lines of thought which the renaissance introduced seemed to stimulate rather than to check the demand for chivalric romances which had grown steadily through the middle ages as we watch in m jusserands pages the development of the novel from caxtons translations through lord bernerss unwieldy romances to the works of fiction produced by shakespeares contemporaries lyly and greene we are deeply impressed by the permanence of mediaeval influences the early elizabethan writers of romances assimilated much renaissance sentiment but it is not until wo reach nashs studies in real life at the close of the sixteenth century that the medico val leaven is superseded lyly with his wealth of illustration drawn from the scientific speculations of the middle ages and his fanciful descriptions of athens or naples and greene with his stories of knights and kings and courts of chivalry look like lineal descendants of the jongleurs of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they reflect the past and despite m jusserands ingenious and luminous suggestions to the contrary only occasionally foreshadow the future but m jusserand has invested his accounts of lylys work and of that of lylys successors with so much fresh and appreciative comment that it will be impossible hereafter to refuse to these survivals a literary any less than an historical interest lylys hero euphues becomes an attractive figure in the skilful hands of m jusserand but euphuess undoubted affinity at some points to richardsons heroes does not convince us quite so readily as m jusserand is convinced that he is in any literal sense  the ancestor in direct line of grandison  or of lord orville the theory at any rate needs further testing of sidney and pastoral romance of thomas nash and the picaresque novel and of english fiction in the seventeenth century m jusserand treats with far more judgement and knowledge than any of our own countrymen have devoted to the subjects m jusserand is able at times to render his criticism and information more effective by drawing upon his knowledge of french literature for illustrative comments sir thomas malorys sole mention of himself or of his personal opinions throughout his monumental epic is in a short chapter in which he laments the decay in his day of virtuous love m jusserand well contrasts the cold seriousness characteristic of the english romancewriter with the impetuous warmth of the author of aucassin and nicolette the relations between early english and french literature have never been fully investigated and the fact that french translations of greenes romances and of sidneys  arcadia became while elizabeth was still queen almost as popular in paris as the originals were in london will be news for many wellinformed students of our literary history some of them may not be more familiar with the circumstance that the debts which french readers of romance contracted to english authors in the sixteenth century were amply repaid in the seventeenth century when english lovers of fiction satiated themselves with the interminable romances of scud cry or la calprenede in english versions these international amenities which have been much neglected by literary historians are worth dwelling on and in the elaborate history of english literature on which it is generally understood m jusserand has long been engaged we may fairly anticipate to find them fully discussed the points of interest about this book are so numerous than it would be impossible to deal with them in detail here but those who read for amusement only may be as safely recommended to procure it as the smaller class who seek to extend their knowledge of the elizabethan epoch which remains the most brilliant of our literature,history_contra

sympathize mt1t11frm sunday it was called mothering sunday because says brand while the ronian church wis thie establishied religtion it was the custom to visit their mother church on kidlent sunday and make their offerings on the high altar so ancient and deep was this feeling that the epistle for that day which alluded to jerusalem mater onsinumjerusalem the mother of us allgalatians iv 21 is still retained by the english church though the occasion is forgotten this feeling of the beautiful maternal relation descended from the church to domestic life and it became the custom for all servants and apprentices on this day to be allowed to visit their mothers and carry with themr some little presents they were reecivel with a rural feast in keeping with the old customs of the day beans in the progressive refinement of living had given way to peas andl peas to boiled corn and therefore the entertainweut of todiay was a dish of excellent furmety why should this beautiful custom have died out with the mass of rubbish which encumbered or defaced the popular festivals of past times why should it not be revived and made a holiday of the heart why should not every family on this day still unite and expect those of its children that are gone out into the world as servants or apprenticesat least such as are near enough to avail themselves of such a privilegeand make it a day of family reunion and affectionate enjoyment why should not the young still be anxious as we are told they used to be in different parts of england  to visit their parents and make them a present of moneey a trinket or some nice eatable and why should not thc ancient dislh of excellent furmety be set to welcome them on the table there is something so beautiful ill this custom that we know of no holiday that can in this respect compare to it the principle embraces all that is lovely andt endearingall that is purifying and strengtlening in domestic life the love of parents the expression of

hear the cries of distress the husband listened but could perceive nothing but the raging of the storm and the thundering of the billows upon the shore he therefore urged his wife to sleep again

dreamed of after some time composed herself to sleep and agfin dreamed precisely as before again she woke her husband and  told him her dream describing to him exactly the spot where the wreck appeared to lie and the miserably perishing state of the few survivors whose cries still seemed to ring in her cars tlhe husband who had no inclination to brave all the horrors of this stormy night in his boat merely on the strength of his wifes dream positively refused aed treated it all as a mere fancy caused by the tumult of the storm the wife on the contrary on whose mind the dream had made the

the newest fiction a guide for novel readers fantasias by george egerton the fantasias are six in number and they are dedicated to mr le gallienne the titles are the star worshipper the elusive melody the mandrake venus the futile quest  the kingdom of dreams and  the well of truth george egertons fantasias do not appreciably differ from the allegories of other writers except that her satire is more bitter john lane 156 pp 3s 6d  fantasias by george egerton lane i   jll j11 1  h george egerton is irredeemably dull when she attempts allegory chiefly because she does not in the least understand how the thing should be done an allegory which starts with pilgrims or vague arcadian characters with illdefined habitations should not launch out into allusions to county councils or popular newspapers or great critics or the state regulation of vice  the whole point of an allegory is thereby lost which is from personalities or places drawn from au imaginary world to extract lessons for actual circumstances or else by a representation of an ideal world to suggest a picture of reality but suddenly to interrupt the imaginary picture by an allusion to crude realities is like gumming real flies on to a picture to make it look lifelike there is a certain amount of satire intended in the pictures produced in fantasias but it is not very biting in a word it is the dullest book yet produced by an author who is not very amusing at her best a departure from tradition and other stories by rosaline masson bliss sands  co is a pleasant volume it consists of two comparatively long stories and six of shorter dimensions  one of the six is selected to give the title to the volume the best story in the book is that entitled  a moulted feather which might be better described as  passages in the history of a family of no importance not only is the story well told but it shows genuine pathos and literary capacity the whole of the book is carefully written and it should find favour with those who wish to vary the reading of singlevolume novels by dipping into volumes of collected stories the writer is one whose work should have attractions for the magazine editor of the day hagar of the pawnshop by fergus hume skeffington  son consists of a series of stories strung on a slender thread hagar is a lady of gypsy birth who is compelled by circumstances to take charge of a pawnshop in london  and the writer constructs a set of stories mostly dependent on crime or cupidity for their interest associated with her customers these stories are well told and are decidedly readable though in less skilful hands they would possess very slight elements of interest fergus humes readers may be interested to know that the italian renaissance is described as a wild and contradictory time that the word otherwhere  is to be found in these pages  and that a second edition of the  divina commedia was printed and published in florence in the fourteenth century it is not surprising to learn that this edition is extremely rare and worth much money  fantasias by george egerton 3s 6d lane whatever was bold or naughty in 1 keynotes and its successors has vanished and in its place we see nothing but insignificance the sketches in george egertons latest book are mild and dull allegories such as young persons of much vague sentiment and little knowledge of life find their easiest expression in the gospel behind being that of the pioneer club somewhat weakened the symbolism is not always very successful the woman with an inordinate love of porridge standing for the philistine and the huntsman who hunted butterflies on horseback for don juan are unhappily chosen we think there is less extravagance of language than formerly but we come across such doubtful phrases as  eyes filled with luminous speering and inborn sadness is  speering  english or scots either way it is misspelt her old habit of coining words is not yet successful 1 advertisive is surely a bad shot and what is one to say of anyone who pretends to style and makes use of the vulgarism  common or garden   as for the matter of it all it is old and trite and truethe loneliness of genius the grossness of the world the love of lying great themes but feeble sentimental grumblings will not wake us up anew to the truth of the charge and the pity of it  fantasias reviews by  george egerton john lane by fantasias  george egerton  means very much the same thing that olive schreiner meant by breamsshort moral stories wherein the characters are not men and women but types of men and women or personifications of abstract qualities the new prac titioner of the art of allegory takes however more liberty than her predecessor she would not only teach but chastise also the satire is bludgeonly and  george egerton mingles real and ideal until we are disconcerted by bizarre effects  for her method she seems to have gone to hans andersen bunyan and thackeray  the well of truth  has this passage  no one is in society who does tell the truth added the governess who was a privileged person mendacity is the essential oil of the social machinery  you need not be a liar my dear said the family friend who was in the foreign office  because you have acquired the tongue of well bred society it only needs diplomacy   in  the starworshipper  we find this sometimes the moonbeamsmade a ladder up which she used to climb and see spirits with whom she spent hours in sweet converse so one night when the reeds were swayingtheir slim greenbodies to the rhythm of their oldworld melody and the river rippled and whispered to the flowers on its banks and the white eggs of the night birds gleamed as signposts for the mother birds out mothfaring in the gloom and the night crooned lullabies arid the music of the spheres above stole down and nuhgledvfi the bass voice of the earth below she gave birth to a little lad  the little lad grew up and became a poet and two or three pages later we read  it is shakespeare said the schoolmaster every one cant be a shakespeare sniffed one of the matrons whose son wrote corner verse for the obunty advertiser no but every one can jbe a minor poet snuffed the lady journalist noting the reply on her cuff for future use   we confess tb disliking such transitions a book called fantasias might at any rate be free from smart lady journalists as for the thought contained in these allegories it is not new and not particularly subtle but such asone might expect from a keen sighted intellectual woman with  views the writing is often extremely clever the clever selfconscious writing of one who has read much poor human nature is very wrong indeedwe know thatbut it gives us no pleasure to see the lash laid on with such relish as george egerton

the devils chain by e jenkins mp london  strahan  co 1876 people who have seen mr cruikshanks design called the bottle which is a large canvas containing hundreds of groups of drunkards perhaps find it not very easy to understand how mr matthew arnold came to write a sonnet to the artist the bottle is scarcely a work of art it has indeed a central interest but that interest is a moral purpose and no one can say that the picture of the crowds of boozy and bulbous figures is one that gives pleasure to the spectator  say what shall calm us when such guests intrude like comets on the heavenly solitude   asks the poet and the reviewer may be allowed to say that mr jenkins story the devils chain on which he has no intention of writing a sonnet is more a moral comet of the bottle sort than a work of art indeed mr jenkins admits that he has not tried to write a pleasing work of fiction his aim is  to exhibit in rude stern truthful outlines the full features of the abuses he would humbly help to remove the abuses are those that spring from the traffic of drink  mr jenkins finds men dining comfortably and voting steadily in utter disregard of their fell disastrous and diabolical effects he  cannot acquit himself of having too long done the like one hopes that mr jenkins will continue to vote with his wonted steadiness  it would not however be easy for a sensitive person to dine comfortably immediately after reading his devils chain the devil8 chain is a tissue of horrors the first link shows us a woman of bad character and of about fortyfour years of age entertaining a secretary of state and a young gentleman who had left balliol at the age of nineteen after a distinguished career with brandy sherry and champagne this is bad enough but the secretary had scarcely time to tell his precocious friend that their hostess was a mrs hurlingham sister of their acquaintance captain conistoun when she leapt out of the window and fell dead at the feet of her husband who was staggering past in the last stage of drunkenness but one on beholding this spectacle miss lucy merton a virtuous grisette fainted and was entertained by a young man a total stranger with the refreshment of hot brandy and water an unpleasant episode follows about which we shall merely say that the christian name of the total stranger is singularly illchosen meantime the secretary of state had wrapped himself up in a large cloak which he wore for purposes of disguise when pursuing his nefarious pleasures and had retired with the balliol man from the disastrous scene mr jenkins may have borrowed the cloak from pericles prince of tyre act iv scene 6  here comes the lord lysimachus disguised a coroners inquest was held on the dead woman and mr jenkins points out with very great force and truth the wretched results of the unseemly habit of holding coroners inquests in public houses at the inquest the drunken husband is brought forward and a letter is read which had been addressed to him by his deceased wife why did she call him henry when his name was lucius why did mrs merton p 167 call her husband john when his name p 155 was william  or do people change their names when they take to drink joseph cray becoming john cray in part of the narrativeas they do when they enter religion  but mr jenkins has not aimed at artistic results the coroner elicits the facts that lucius or henry hurlingham was a man of family and wealth that his wife took to brandy and other sins that he had followed her example till he sank with a life of gindrinking and that the pair had a daughter whose education was conducted at the expense of mrs hurlingham business being over the coroner described as a gentleman goes and gets drunk with un nomme bugby described as a newspaper reporter and leaderwriter do coroners get drunk  do journalists of standing attend coroners inquests do reporters of inquests write leaders  let us next follow the fortunes of the balliol man he was the son of a rich scotch distiller named bighorne he had done well at eton which he must have left at about fifteen and at the university but in three fatal years this promising boy was morally ruined by  constant visits to the tastingroom  in his fathers distillery bighorne peer had sent him into the business where he grew too fond of the paternal gin as confectioners apprentices do of pastry henry bighornes sister is a study of the brighter side of life  the oval sweet yet firmly featured face with that noble wealth of original hair wreathed up in plaits and curls upon the symmetrical head in grecian fashionthe slightly aquiline nose exquisite mouth and chin the skin mantled with a complexion purely and gloriously englishall this made miss emily bighorne bother her patronymic and may she soon exchange it for a better a subject of admiration which could well endure the rivalry of the artists who had showered their works upon the home of the wealthy distiller of british brandy and gin this heroine had a very natural hatred of her fathers business for as she worked among the poor in westminster she knew that the paths of ginmaking lay hold upon hell but she could not even rescue her  brother who borrowing some money from her fled away and hid himself for fear of compromising the reputation ofthe secretary i of state and so bringing down the govern  ment of the hour the place where iiq fled to was the hut of a drunken prizefighting j scoundrel employed in ironworks near j burslem this man bill knowsley got j drunk on the money given him by bighorne j kicked his wife to death and killed all his i six children in this scene mr jenkins has i painted with great power a kind of event which is perfectly familiar to all of us from report and which probably has never been common in any savagery or in any civilisation except that of happy england to be brief henry bighorne dies of fever and exposure in the house of a curate  the daughter of the hurlinghams runs away heaven knows why with a drunken sot of a middleaged parson and we last see her in a musichall a few other characters here and there including the drunken clergyman and a dissenting tradesman die of drink and the secretary of state his disguise not availing him leaves england in a ship most of whose crew are intoxicated and is lost in a fire at sea being last seen in the act of throwing his famous cloak over a halfnaked girl perhaps we should be grateful to any writer who keeps before our eyes the condition of our civilisation perhaps the sermon against taking alcohol in moments of exhaustion cannot too often be preached it may even be allowed that fic tion is a good medium for morality but one fails to see how the heaping up of so many thickcoming horrors in one small volume can awaken any useful feeling this is the weak point of all stories with a purpose in novels dated about 1786 we know that the virtuous peasant will suffer in one day all the woes that are spread over the whole history of the villein and in temperancetales we look for the horrors of a year crushed into a few weeks and we are not disappointed mr jenkins does not attempt to prescribe the purge for the evils he catalogues and it is not likely that his book will arouse any one to the sense of these evils who was not alive to them before it is a shameful thing that the trade in liquor should be  forced  by advertisements and by public houses started by distillers it is a wretched thing that society should be based on forms of labour which disfigure the body and that the labourer should find his only consolation amusement and culture in the pothouse if mr jenkins book could hasten by one hour the time when society shall have a new conscience and a new aimpossibly a new organisationone

artingale castle by t adolphus trollope 3 vols chapman  hall  artingale castle is a sensible wellwritten story the characters are carefully described there is a good substratum of romance to go upon with a mystery to hunt out and unravel by way of occupation for three goodly and wellfilled volumes the english is good and the style in which it is written proves the author to be a scholar and a gentleman but the novel that is the result of all these good materials is not entertaining on the contrary it is decidedly dry we are very sorry to say it but we have read stories without a tenta of the virtues which we have ascribed to mr t a trollope not only readable but decidedly interesting and compelling the reader in spite of all the protests from his common sense to read them straight through to the end and to confess with some shame after closing the last volume that it might be great rubbish but that he could not sut it down until he knew how it all ended tow no reader will venture to call artingale castle rubbish but we question whether any reader will feel the least anxiety to know the end or will be unable to lay down the book at any page or period when he ought to go about other business artingale castle is not as a novel well constructed there are so many false starts before the main story fairly begins that the reader is disappointed and fatigued and his interest is languid the third page gives great hopes of what is to come there are two cuttings from an old newspaper one announcing the approaching marriage in fashionable life of sir george artingale to lady georgiana tarla tane the other advertising the sailing of the good ship mary thornton  for boston in the colony of massachusetts north america the connexion between these two pieces of intelligence is made clear by the interview of the family lawyer mr harding with the beautiful scotchwoman who claims to be sir george artingales lawful wife but whom that gentleman entirely disowns confessing he had imposed upon her by a fraudulent marriage as t she has no means of proving her own case or of disproving his assertion she meekly accepts her position and an allowance of two hundred a year for the sake of her child both of them sail for boston in the mary thornton and are heard of no more the family lawyer mr harding entertains his own suspicions and writes a letter to the baronet his client which comes to light on a future dav and proves where a mystery has been hidden which on further search reveals itself sir george dies and is buried his wife the lady georgiana dies and is buried and their son sir hildebrand reigns in their stead he has a beautiful sister named agnes who is the heroine of an episode that leads to nothing except to prove the great family pride both of miss agnes artingale and of her brother sir hildebrand all these are preliminary to the story sir hildebrand has to marry and to have an only daughter and the daughter has to grow up fair and blooming before the tale can be said to he fairly afloat by this time the reader is pretty well fatigued by so many beginnings besides all this artingale castle itself has fallen into disrepair and the reigning baronet wishes much to rebuild it but the wicked sir george has so impoverished the family estates that there is no prospect of keeping the roof over the venerable old castle there is however a certain friend and neighbour mr farland of farlandstoke who has an only son felix by namealso much money and he and sir hildebrand agree that the young people are to marry and mr farland is to build up oastle artingale the arrangement looks promising mr felix is an excellent young man miss mary artingale is a charming heiress with all the traditions of family pride carefully instilled into her neither of them has any great objection to the other but neither of them is disposed to love or marry the other matters go on calmly an architect is brought to consider plans and estimates he is to give miss mary drawinglessons and they fall in love the vicar has a pretty and piquante daughter and mr felix finds her pleasanter than miss mary there arrives a fine young american sailor introduced by a retired seacaptain he bears a strange resemblance to sir hildebrand gradually the mystery grows and the old secret comes to light the missing links are ferreted up by a sharp young attorney and the result is what all readers will anticipate the alleged false marriage of sir george was a valid one the handsome american sailor is the lawful heir and poor sir hildebrand is illegitimate a fact which pains him more than having to give up artingale castle much happiness to others comes incidentally from this setting right an old wrong we do not think the young american behaved too generously to sir hildebrand but all the young people are married to their hearts content miss mary who as her fathers heiress could not have marriedher drawingmasterfinds now no

a daughter of the morning by hugh de selincourt chatto and windus 6s in spite of inequalities and a certain rather annoying way of twisting all events to his theories mr de selincourt has produced an acutely alive piece of work to which his somewhat farfetched title gives little clue the theme is the old old one of love versus convention but even more than in the vivid manner of its treatment the success of the book lies in the character drawing which is a real achievement the only people who do not ring true are smith the gardener his extraordinarily broadminded wife and the servant girl lucy whom he loves but constance howard the pleasantfaced young woman of twentyeight who never in all her prosperous life has been startled into thought until she comes on smith and lucy passionately kissing her mother that gentle humorous lady and james the young painter cousin who sleeps out of doors in a bag airing his head and his theories are all in the picture though we confess to agreeing with constance when she feels that she can never really like james but the triumph of the book is reginald trew the middleaged and married art critic and he is such a triumph that were there nothing else good in the book he would justify it trews affair with the awakened constance the way he makes literary love to her his longing to take all she offers and his cowardly withdrawal at the last in the relation of these things as in the description of constances survival of her pain mr de selincourt has achieved much and most of all does he succeed in the letter which TRUE writes to constance when he fails her youd have made me a different man if id been ten years younger and circumstances had been kinder writes trew the child of circumstances youd have put spirit in me shes taken the spirit out of me it was my luck to meet her too soon and to meet you too late    everyone likes me people beam when they see me    ive a sweet nature and a gentle voice i cant help saying the sympathetic thing oh if vou knew how i loathe myself    i am trying to tell you the truth i dont know the truth i can only curse fate you would have made me a man   youth has gone manhood has not come im to be pitied that is his cry to the last as it always is to a man of his type impressionable yet shallow affectionate yet incapable of understanding the wounds he deals to those for whom he professes affection and through it all till vision of him becomes too clear how lovable  it is the presentment of reginald TRUE that makes of a daughter of the morning a book to be read  a daughter of the morning by hugh de selin court 6s chatto  windus constance howard a young lady of some twentyfive summers awoke one morning unusually early and was annoyed to find that she could not go to sleep again she was at a loss to know how to occupy the time before breakfast she had a horror of thinking about such elementary questions as her own life and her own body such matters were considered morbid in her respectable household and constance distrusted  morbidness eventually she jumped out of bed and gazed out of her window and then fell on her knees to pray that she might be made d a daughter of the morning she was not quite sure what she meant by the phrase but it remained in her mind constances prayer is answered and the steps of her development are cunningly portrayed by means of two threads in the story smith the gardener in constances home has an invalid wife who is so devoted to her husband that his happiness is her only joy hence an illicit connexion with lucy constances maid merely causes the good lady gratefully to sing her  nunc dimiltis before constance could gain spiritual insight however it was necessary for her to fall in love with a man who was already married and who only withdrew from an alliance on the ground that if one lives in the world one must conform to its standards it was impossible for the story as conceived by the author to proceed on anything but unpleasant lines and we are sorry that his great gifts should not have been displayed to better advantage  a daughter of the morning fiction by hugh de selincourt chatto and windus 6s was it mere coincidence that after reading mr de s61incourts latest book a certain poem which begins  by this he knew she wept with waking eyes haunted us with its sad solemn organtones we find in a daughter of the morning despite its charm of writing and its pages of thoughtful and amusing dialogue little but sadness one would imagine that instead of being a practised author and a competent critic mr de s61incourt was one of the crowd anxious to shock the sensibilities keen on finding a fresh situation of the weariful  problem  description he has undoubtedly found it here but frankly it is unpleasanta mans mistress welcomed by his invalid wife for the sake of the possible child and no amount of draping with roses will make it less so this is a pity after the delightful promise of  a fair house and it is not the only shadow on the book that a woman so strictly and innocently brought up as was constance to the age of twentyeight should suddenly undergo a smart volteface and virtually not virtuouslyask another womans husband to visit her is quite incredible he failed her at the last having reserves of strength which she did not suspect he was  a coward and this constituted her trial  the knowledge seared and burnt her somehow the sense of proportion is lacking from this novel and we are doubly sorry for there are memorable pages and some perfectly delightful characters and certain metaphors and sentences that mark mr de selincourt as of the tribe of henry james perhaps in his next work he will hark back from  modern love  to  love in the valley

life in sweden with excursions in norway and denmark by selina bunbury 2 vols hurst  blackett when we were speaking of the belligerent and inconsolable mrs herveys travels in kashmir we characterised the present as an age of  odd female travellers miss bunburys book does not tempt us to withdraw the epithetthough it must be forthwith added that her curiosities of travel are of a more quaint and feminine order than those of the oriental tourist miss bunbury exhibits herself as bustling curious sentimental resolute to see and not averse to be seenin a manner calculated to suggest whimsical thoughts of the impression which her solitary appearance must have produced in circles wherein the travelled englishwoman is a rarity our authoress appears avowedly to have announced herself as travelling with a view to publication and to have got on in a fashion sufficiently unique let us take an instance at randomwhile waiting in christiania for an j eclipse it occurred to miss bunbury that she  would improve the interval by taking a run into the country never having learned to drive j herself in a carriole and feeling that a solitary expedition in a strange land of which she could not speak the language might be unsafe as well as conspicuousshe met willingly a proposition made by those whom she consulted that she should hire a divinity student on the point of taking orders to drive her and to keep her company the narrative shall be continued in her own words the tomorrow came i could scarcely sleep from excitement however having my travels before me i tried to make a good breakfast every book of travels in the north i had read asserted that in these regions one might always calculate on good eggs so eggs i always have ordered hitherto in the hotel de scandinavie however i think they must be reserved for the use of us english only for they have invariably been kept too long when presented to me i was ready notwithstanding and had my bonnet in my hand when the

professor  i have another plan for lyon just what you call the very thing there is 1 a lieutenant who wants to go to see his family somewhere on the road to bergen  he is glad to have a tree passage and will attend you then i must go on the road to bergen very well it is the most  beautiful road i will go for him now and return  in half an hourwhat easy resources they have i here  i said to myself in three or four hours the i professor returned i should have come sooner i he said but the lieutenant has now promised to i accompany a blind man who has come to see our country and a promise to a blind man you know must be kept before one to a lady  perhaps  yesbefore one to a lady who has eyes but no matter i have another plan much more suited to you yes this you will say is the very thing see now one of our fairylegend writers is going to make a tour a tour in fairyland  i interrupted clasping my hands and feeling myself wafted back to the jar far distant years of my blessed childhood  j  and i shall share it yes he will drive and if  you wish to draw draw what the carriole  j  ack nay he is going to collect fairylegends  and if you wish towhat do you call it in english  j said the professor marking lines on the palm of his i hand sketch  yes if you wish to sketch   you can do so while he collects the fairylegends  j and i will give him my sketches for his legends i  no that cannot be native art and literature only  are encouraged here the government sends this  fairyhunter and has already paid him for his  legends and sends him on his tour free oh  dear no government would pay me for mine  we have no governmenttrain to fairyland but you must wait till tomorrow said the professor    the professor had told me that the fairylegend   hunter spoke english a delightful knowledge this   was to me for i am by no means strong in northern i tongues thus in the hope of using and hearing my  own i was quite at ease when the next day they both j made their appearance the professor presented  i me formally herr fairyhunter made a great many   bows and as so many bows involve a good many s i curtsies i inclined nearly as often then with a last  j reverence he spoke in english and said very slowly  i complain of you much that you are so dis t agreeable but now i make an extra i made my r i last reverence in reply such a speech by way of a i i complimentary one was rather startling and not a s j little alarming i looked nervously at the professor who with profound gravity interpreted his friends meaning thushe pities you for being so disagreeably circumstanced  but he is making an abridgment of his book and therefore cannot now make his tour i bowed with a sense of relief and the 1 j fairyhunter and myself exchanged some sentences e i which i do not record as i believe the fairies alone 0 would be nble to understand the language  i have e  got another plan for you said the professor  yes this is the very thing a teacher of music here wishes to take his wife and child into the country and one of our operavoices who also speaks italian which you do likewisewill go with them they will all join you  but as they must leave their affairs here they expect you will pay all the travelling expenses they will bring their own provisions because there are none to be got on the road that is fair  very fair indeed i answered  the very thing i complain of you much  murmured the fairyhunter looking at me compassionately you must then take n carriage said the professor it will be quite filled i replied four persons with norsecloaks pipes tobaccopouches provisions and luggage and the child  added my professor 4 ah  i suppose i must take it on my knee you are very disagreeable said the fairyhunter with a look of commiseration at me but i thought secretly that others were still more disagreeable  but mr murrays handbook says it is dangerous to take a heavy carriage over the hills of norway and certainly a roll down among such et ceteras would not be pleasant i added herr fairyhunter moved uneasily on his chair worked his hands together shook his head disprovingly and said you must he complained of miss

as companion i set off by the steam boat on lake miilar it was truly a miserable day toward the latter end of septemlier the cold was such that no amount of clothing seemed to me enough  and there on board that boat was a poor little frenchwoman the wife of a professor of paris without any sort of cloak or defence against it i gave her part of mine and made her put her feet at the open door of the fireroom we sat there and talked french she told me her husband had come to sweden in order to acquaint himself fully with its history politics past and present state in regard to government agriculture produce manufactures eve c how long had he been in sweden  i asked nearly six weeks she answered this seems indeed a favourite time for authors visits   the whole passage on the lake to upsala was very dreary it is not at any time so interesting or beautiful here as it is in other parts the prevalence of that drug in swedish scenery and indeed in swedish ground the fir and pine ami the nearly total absence of what are called here curiously enough leaftreesthat i all trees that bear leaves in summer and not in winter gives a monotonous and rather heavy air to the banks which is only occasionally diversified by the appearance of such fine places as skokloster and if such be the case at all times it may be supposed what it was on a dark rainy and bitterly cold day we landed however and got to an hotel and were given an immense room with a couple of sofas in it which at night were opened and the treasures they contained were taken out anti laid upon them and so your sofa is turned into your bed and your sittingroom into your steeping room with very little ado and the evening was so wet that i stayed in the house and tried to persuade myself i was in upsala   when i went out of the hotel on a sunshiny morning i went about and about and said where is upsala and my companion said  you are in it and i answered no i am in a clean modern goodlooking town of new wooden houses painted or coloured in all colours chiefly red the streets are wide very wide indeed and the whole thing looks as if it had sprung up in a night by the work of a few carpenters hands there is an old orangecoloured castle partly in ruins up there on a great elevation from whence you see interminably around over one vast plain unbroken almost by a tree the widest barest most uninteresting scene i ever beheld there is an immense brick cathedral deformed by swedish taste in renovation standing in an open space there are multitudes of men young and middle aged walking everywhere about with cigars or pipes in their mouths and hideous boys caps of white jean on their heads and no other academic dress whenever they get together in groups or set out on their favourite annual tours they sing a great deal make much noise and generally act rather rudely these are the students miss bunbury passed a winter in stockholm as the lodger of a countesswho instructed her benignantly on the manners and customs and shortcomings of english ladies and who is depicted as being a mean oldfashioned prejudiced womanilliberal in her notionsand not very generous in her hospitalities the coming on

at courtand an illustration of conventional modesty new to usin its comicality outdoing the most outrageous case or specimen gathered by mrs trollope or by capt marryat  as i was unable to eke out the little adornment which nature herself had bestowed upon my head by wearing the plumes more lavishly bestowed on other creatures without being guilty of usurping the honours of matrimony i felt it necessary to make the most of my natural advantages by calling in the aid of a hairdresser kccolleering having seen a shop of that description kept by a frenchman from paris somewhere about bruukehcrg i thought there was no ditliculty in the way and asking froken to accompany me on a walk i went out intending to make this matter its object the shop proved to he a perfumery ami fancy tttionery one also there was a woman only therein who when i asked for monsieur said she was his wile and supposed she would do as well i replied no for i wanted him to come to dress my hair  not your own hair she said in a solemn and questioning manner certainly my own hairon your headcertainly on my own head can i see him the good woman looked at me with a face that plainly said what an audaciously hardened creature this must be to make such a proposal then abruptly saying  he is absent he is in paris he is very ill in bed she turned her back and looked up at the articles on her shelf i went away on our road i saw a sign with  pcrukmakare upon it and before froken could stop nie i entered the shop there was a man here  is it to make a peruke he inquired  no to come to dress my hair the poor man seemed to undergo a convulsion to avoid laughter then he looked so awkward i think he blushed but i looked out and saw froken standing with a very pretty face of perfect distress in the street madame madame she cried at the door when i appeared that is impossible that we can ask for a hairdresser in stockholm pray madame come home i want to be at home i went home with the poor girl thinking only that it is very unpleasant for any one not interested in an object to go about thus on an unpleasant day looking for what is not easily found a few minutes after we entered the house i followed froken to the salong and found my hostess leaning her back against the kakelugn or stove and laughing most heartily while froken stood before with a halfashamed halfrelieved countenance evidently in the act of confession  yes madame cried the former interrupting her laugh to speak to me and taking it up again yes i am telling her that is not so dangerous and the laugh recommencedwhatto ask for a hairdresser that there was some infection going which such persons were in danger of conveying i was now quite convinced but when i simply asked if this were the case a roar of laughter echoed through the great room it brought out some young ladies to see if what was going on were roliga word i think oftener used in the swedish language than in any other certainly oftener than we use its english expletiveamusing but to see all the modest faces that were put to the blush when they heard that madame had actually been inquiring for a hairdresser  well said the hostess at last it is not wonderful that madame should do so for in my younger days it was not thought improper to employ a man to dress hair improper i cried opening my eyes as a new light dawned on them and that good wifes shocked expression of face reappeared before themimproper why in england where propriety is very much thought of and in france too that is an everyday occurrence1 yes yes that is not dangerous and that i find quite a foolish idea though it is our custom said our hostess for once in her life giving up the perfection and immutability of swedish ways  it was not so in my youth no when i was in the world it was not improper to have a hairdresser the ladies ran away and i asked the elder one in private what it was that constituted this impropriety that is just what i cannot well say she replied but no lady here would have a man to dress her hair they have women who are taught to do so but these women are taught by men yes but man kan inte hjelpe det the fact is it is a ladys propriety but not a womans that is shocked by employing a male hairdresser i remarked it is our custom madame but i grant you i do not think it a wise one for it was not thought dangerous when i was in the world forty years agobut how can it be so now  whyyou know he must go into the ladies apartments yes but men often do so here at all times and sit and talk there with them yes but you know their toilet is not complete when their hair is to be dressedbut propriety is much more outraged when it is complete i answered man kan inte hjelpe det said the noble dame and ran off to the kitchen the above extracts will suffice to give the reader a fairand we think a not unpleasant idea of miss bunburys book she is not so much wanting in good nature ns wanting in taste she possesses the power of observation in larger proportion than the faculty of selection a sledge accident which confined her to the house made her the object of affectionate ministration on the part of miss bremerto whose thoughtful and

the white causeway by frankfurt moore hutchinson  co with a presentday case of ten personalities in one body under investigation we feel thankful to mr moore that ho has confined his attention to duality and there is nothing so oppressively psychological in the white causeway as to frighten away those who look only for the sparkling dialogue and epigram of this author well  authenticated instances of annihilation of memory have been investigated by doctors and as in the case of olive strickland arthur garnetts betrothed the mental balance disturbed by one catastrophe has in several cases been restored by a second the best piece of characterdrawing in the book is undoubtedly lady calthorpe a charming type of conventional womanhood  eminently sane healthy tactful and devoted and some of the situations brought about by the heroines loss of memory are well conceived the heros position becomes almost gilbertian  should a man consider himself bound to a young woman who had at one time responded to his affection for her but who had since lost all consciousness of having done so and become indifferent to him   in this case the man remains steadfast and is rewarded it seems a pity that mr moore should introduce so material an incident as that of the jewelled hairpin into the most psychological part of his book there is something almost jarring in this attempted fusion of matter and spirit and one could cheerfully spare some of the almost prosy passages in the earlier part of the story as well as the illustrations  the white causeway by f frankfurt moore hutchinson 6s mr frankfurt moore has accomplished the difficult feat of introducing the supernatural into a story of modern life without producing a grotesque effect of improbability the secret of his success hes in the fact that he has mastered the subtle art of construction and so little by little he leads the mind of the reader up to the proper receptive point before he brings out his pike de resistance very cunningly he uses every device to stimulate the imagination to mystery using the awe of the mountains with the curious legends about them that are current among the people as his takingoff place into the unknown spiritual world he does not approach psychic phenomena in the spirit of the believer as miss underbill in the grey world but rather as an expert writer to whom such matters though within the mental range of the broadminded primarily afford infinite possibilities for sensation and the result is a capital story a story which goes with a rare swing and is all the more pleasant because it is written in admirable english and with wit olive austin and arthur garnett are in love with each other and their love is tinged with the mysterious splendour of the alpine mountains among which it first finds expression she is a girl in touch with things spiritual she has strange premonitions and sees visions notably the white causeway which they say was  built by the spirits of the peaks to enable the spirits of the valley to mingle with them one day when she is rowing on the lake a sudden storm swamps the boat and garnett only just manages to rescue her for four hours the doctors unceasingly try to revive her and she is only called back to life by the wild cry of her lover but she has died passed over as the phrase is and herein lies the point of the book her soul and body are separate and only united by her great love  but the shock has deprived her of memory so that while her soul remembers her corporeal form does not even recognise her lover the situations which arise are finely conceived and work up to a magnificent climax which no one who has a taste for the frileuse in literature would do well to miss the whole book is interesting and should be read for it is an excellent example ot mr frankfurt moores versatile ability,history_contra
cecilia a story of modem rome by francis marion crawford macmillan  co a new novel from the pen of mr crawford comes as a welcome change after a series of badly designed and ill  written stories he certainly conceives a definite history and delineates definite characters he both thinks and writes while all too many of our purveyors of current fiction seem to consider thinking and writing two of the things least essential in the preparation of a story in  cecilia mr crawford takes us once more into the roman society which he knows so well and which he has again and again deftly delineated here once more he uses in a fresh and effective fashion facts or fictions from the debatable borderland between the provinces of ascertained science and occult lore the heroine is in some mysterious way a reincarnation of the last of the vestal virgins and is capable of throwing herself into a kind of hypnotic trance in which she lives over again some of the thrilling moments which preceded the close of her sacred office stranger still the man whom she sees in the trance is also reincarnated in modern rome and sees in dreams that which she witnesses when hypnotized when the two meet for the first time in the flesh it is to be conscious that they have long known each other in the spirit and from this is subtly woven an entrancing tale of the beauty and tragedy of love unlike some of the fictionwriters who venture into the mysteries of the occult mr crawford never lets us lose touch with the actual so that we are impressed by the story as we are by the records of the salpetriere cecilia is in every way worthy of its authors reputation  cecilia a story of modern rome by f marion crawford macmillan 6s mr crawfords new story though its subtitle painfully recalls the two much discussed novels set in that city of which the public has recently heard so much has nothing in common either in manner or matter with this school of fiction  cecilia  is the story of two men and a girl and is destitute of all political and sermonising pretensions to a large extent it is a study of telepathy and selfhypnotism but though the unexplained is touched upon the atmosphere of the story remains simple and almost tranquil throughout cecilia an heiress and the man lamberti meet for the first time only to realise that they are already perfectly familiar with one another the girl has dreamed of him all her life and from that meeting each commences to dream of the other every nightthe same dreamand both awake to hear their doors close softly as if after someones departure though both invariably lock themselves in upon retiring to rest lamberti is a sailor a born fightingman who had seen much active service in remote parts of africa china and elsewhere upon the commencement of the dreams he not unnaturally consults a nerve specialist but is found completely sound in mind and body the girl meanwhile lias become engaged to his greatest friend the marriage is near before she realises that she is passionately in love with the man of her dreamsthe nan she kisses every night in a state of trance or self1 ypnotipm then there is trouble but in the end though lovers avhom fate has predestined apparently for one another are allowed to be happy the second man has of course to suffer in life unfortunately there is always someone who has to do that mr crawford handles his subject with all his usual ease and dexterity  cecilia  never rises to any great height of emotion or excitement but it is in some ways all though more comfortable reading for that the reader with leisure to dispose of goes on steadily from page to page without skipping incessantly to know the issue of each successive entanglement with a less placid treatment this would inevitably have resulted,history_contra

not time to under stand being too busy with his music and fallalling after women folk for me i see no good in suchlike they eat a iiians substance only i am heartsorry for my dear mistressthat is my masters wife whom her husband calls poor wretch but i at her request sweet cozin though indeed i am no kin of the flesh to mistress pepysonly he whomn she calls her bachelor she doth choose the ribbons for myl kneebreeches of the right blue which she will have dark on account of my eyes being of that hue ah a sweet yomng lady and much to be pitied is my mistressas on my soul i do pity her for though i help my master faithfully in all that concerns his business at home and in the house i am lieged to ally mistressaye and think it no shame for a poor young womnanin must ieeds have someone to stand for her and so she shall so long as my name is hewer though i do repeat i do serve my master faithfully alsoyes and shall yet i own i can never understand her exceeding jealousy of him our master samntuel is well and well enough but there be others with as tight a leg as straight a back andbut there wherefore should one search for the reasons of women she loveth him not greatlyno not to the rubbing of one copper against another save that is when she is jealous of him then her tongue goes like a millhopper and her words fall wide and foolishly till i am ashamed of the imaids hearing as they do from garret to cellar which is all very strange for she hath often told me of her griefs and how that she has found out better things than to fix her love upon such a man who will follow the flutter of a servingmaids kirtle across half london now for me i had liefer bide at home with my toes to the fire and watch my dear mistress at her french broidery or which is yet pleasanter hear her read tie maids tragedy or that french play in which she tripped up mi johii divdei himself finding his last at the kings house to be copied from it almost line by line now anm i resolved to keepi a secret diary also which in the evenings when i stay at home with headache i may read to my lady and when it cannot be otherwise to her chambermaids also at least the plainer of them for the prettier are not to be trusted being apt to be of my masters faction this i do because i hold it a pity that a poor woman should hear nothing exact of what goes forward about the court and in the townonly chatter of mantuamakers and the singing women whomi master plepys brings about the house this solitude will i strive to make easier for her yet must i be careful of my ilntelligences to my mistress for oftentimes she will fall into wild talk and inore than once accusiing of her husband she came nighl to letting the cat out of the bagthat it was i who had spied him out in coaches and slinking about alehouses up this blind alley and down that yet i count it no wvroig faithfully to serve a man and also as faithfully his wife even a poor wretch  must have some coinfort and if she have it at home and in one to whom she can speak freely how much better than gadding abroad so as to become like many others the talk of the town besides tis in all innocency and i hold it fitting that a woman yotung and mighty pretty shall have at least the comfort of being able to speak her mind to a kindly listener hence she speaks to iae and i tell her all that has happenedalso much that i have only heard only the business of the office and of my master i do lnot speak for i would be a faithful friend to botha thing w hich i count difficult but not impossible so then this being the third day of june and mir samuel pepys gone to deptford upon his affairs i lay a page between the folios of the book of requests and begin jtune 3rdthis morning the king walked in the privy garden with the duke and there was very merry declaring that his brother s confessors did nominate his ladyloves to him for a penance they being so plain of their featuresalso old at this the duke tooajl offence and turning on his heel was gone in a huff to the navy office into which he entered like a whirlwind while his brother stood still leaning on his cane and laughing then the kling betook himself to mistress frances stewart with design to pay court to her but she would do nothing but pull cherries from the trees of the royal garden and eat them letting one hang from between her lips by the stalk and calling upon his majesty to declare if lie did not think it desirable then dld she climb a cherrytree with the kings help and being freakish would have him follow to a seat beside her among the branches but this his alajesty refused though smilingly and as one who had it not been for the courtiers would gladly have yielded then came the queen out and so there was an end of the frolic for though her majesty hath need of patience and practises it yet in portugal her country is no jesting wvith such things yet beeause the queen also is fond of mistress stewart and cherishes her for her beauty and simplicity though not boldly witty like our nelly of the kings house there was no anger only the queen did shake her finger at the king and bade him think of his latter end rather than to go climbing trees after scapegrace maids to which the king replied lord madam that was the very thing i was thinking of which all took very well and held to be of a mighty pretty wit it was indeed rare sport to see how little stewart could flout the king and yet keep him more on the edge of himself than castle maine davis gwyn or all the drove of themwithal giving him no satisfaction but only saucy answers and all wvith such a mockery of civility that perforce the king laughed himselfyet methought with a wryish face but afterwards my lord of richmond and the chancellor smiled at her and she at thein so that it was easy to be seen how the three were of a very good intel ligence but the king guessed nothing of it only continued to make eyes at pretty frances till they fairly bulged out of his sallow faceas saith the proverb like the 1101s on a gooseberry fool this mistress frances is used to behave like a child knowin that when she smiles none can find it in their hearts to scoldher face being the most ierfect that ester was seven so much so that the king hath caused his maker of m1eldals john iloettiers to take a medal punching of it in the profile but it is her childishness which wtins upon voui for it is illmpossille to be angry with her she moves quickly like a bird nervous uand light as if ready to dart off in any direction at auy moment though she wears short gowns and those of grey there is always a look about her as of a trolic bird with glossy plumage which ones hand desires to caress but on a sudden lo she escapes from under and is at the end of the corridor laughing and twitter ing and looking back like a thing that always perched upon twigs so at least says the duke and i believe him and so much for mistress frances this day we saw not much of his grace for instead of abiding in the navy office he merely walked a little to and fro stamping his foot and so returned back as he came for this all in the garden wvere heartily sorry for it only made little stewart the more mirthful so that she kneeled anid denianded of the duke of york his fatherly blessing meaning thereby that the story which the lord brunker had told was truenamely that lie was a jesuit still it is a pity to see great men so used in public and the king himself looking on and laughing this doth not make the country respected but the contrary for all the while the french ambassador wvas writing in his tablets and i doubt not all goes to lewis as fast as spur and sail can drive it but after all was done and the king and duke retired once more mistress frances laid aside her spritely manners to talk with the chancellor and my lord richmond very gravely there was none to overlook and mistress stewart did give a hand to each as though mnaking some promise and even the stiff old chancellor set his lips to that which he held while as for my lord richmond he kissed his finger by finger like an holy relic it was by virtue of her maid who is of the country of wales having come hither with miss price that we get us news of the court at first hand of course being my lord dukes servants iv hear much of which i do not speak but what little ann hughes doth prate i think it no shame to tell for if i do not my master will and it is a pleasure to forestall him besides hughes being of the welsh folk doth most merrily invent there is no fear in her being miss frances stewarts favourite woman yet do i believe that for honesty there is none in the court like mistress stewart except only miss jennings who is so for interest and m1iss hobart bv nature and inclination the queen is also well advised of this and tis said little frances doth carry all her sweethearting letters to her majesty to laugh overwhich for a child such as she appears to be is very well thought on juite 4thtoday came the welsh girl ann hughes to our house and my dear mistress made her welcome to such supper as there chanced to be in the house the three of us were scarcely seated before that she clapped her hands and began to entertain us with the very latest news of the courtthe hearing of which gave us much joy there have been mighty fine doings she said all because of the fair at southwark on the common betwixt the abbey and m1argarets hill for nothing would set my lady yestreen but that she must go thither with mistress wells the newcomer among the maids both of them in the garb of saucy pages these they caused us to borrowthat is betty xwho waits upon miss wells and knows all the idle pageknaves in st james found no difficulty but as for me i risked my service and refused to go because of nty modestyand having one knee in and the other out owing to a fall out of my mothers arms long ago in my country but knowing the dangers of the town better than my ladies i did covenant with one rowland glyn a pembroke man and one that is to be trusted to follow them with a wise lad or two of my people anid as things turned out it was just as well for my madcaps being let out on the causeway could at the first do nothing but laugh so that their cloaks wellnigh fell off it was only the clearer dusk of even and no time for such pranks when the theatres are letting so many rambling gallants abroad and the very pavements are far from securesave that is in the puritanic city even so there was a great todo the rude street lads cryers of pampphlets horseholders linkboys and the like made mock onie there was who blasphemed the name of the lord if ever he had seen a sight like that nay he did pretend to faint being a shy knave and summoned his comrades to hold him up sinking into their arms as one overcome by vast terror and amazement but rowland glyn and his mate called for  prentices and the lads of the apron swarmed out of the booths so that my ladiei were briefly rid of these rascals and after this they walked quite close behind mistresses stewart and wells behaving like serving men but still holding their cudgels ready so that few dared meddle with them understanding well that it would be at their peril but when they arrived at the fair there were so many booths to examine and so many fine gentlemen elbowing hither and thither that rowland could by no means keep so close so it chanced that some of these jostling the ladies without intent as i believe miss wells pulled out her little rapier that was no more than a toy anid ait the sight of the naked steel mistress stewart began to weep so there was a great trooping to the spot and as illluck would have it my lord of rochester who is always to be found where mischief is would have them both into his carriage but by great good fortune rowland perceived the duke of richmond who is greatly in love with mistress frances only hides it for fear of the kings anger and he bade him come quickly for that there was a young brother of mistress stewarts just arrived from scotland and in sore need of assistance so richmond with george hamilton and the frenchman grammunt called the chevalier did set rochester at defiance and carried wells and stewart to their coaches and so back to whitehall without any scandal save that which rochester made with his tongue but my lord of bucking ham being willing to stand well with the queens ladies did take rochester aside in the park and say to him that if he did not hold his tongue he would kill him as he had shrewsbury and pray which of the two ladies would hold your graces horse this time  said rochestermeaniing that my lady shrewsbury had done the like while buckingham wvias killing her husband no matter wv hich said buckingham  so be you are lead and whether rochester was afraid or whether as sonie said lie owed his grace money wvhich lie could not pay i know not at all events rochester hath been very civil to the ladies illy mistress anl aliss wellsthe which was very far indeed from his habit however either because of his fear of the king or of buckingham lie had nought to say this was ann hughes tale and my dear mistress was much troubled at the doings of those in high places so after the welshwoman was gone and i returned from the convoy she did question me tightly of all those whom i knew and as to my masters conduct concerning which i made the best answers i could assuring her what is quite true that there is none at court to compare to her for beauty that ever i have seen and that mr pepys do always so uphold it and she was much comfortedthat is at first and i did sit and keep her company almost till her husband did return as lie said fromn working late at deptford and but for its ending this had been a good day and memorable to me in that my dear lady showed me much kindness far above her wont yet can i not cure her of the fits of fury she hath about her husband if he be halfanhour late in returning even if the poor man is but at his booksellers she will not believe but vents her displeasure at large which is but little profit and makes for the unhappiness of the house as for example this very night it happened to myself for mistress pepys was very severe with me because that i went as far as whitehall with the welsh girl ann hughes she was sitting crying when i came back and at first would not speak to me saying that nobody loved her or cared whether she were dead or alivethat it was like master like man for the one courted the mistresses and the other the maids and as for her that she would go to a nunnery to end her days nor would she listen to a word when i told her how that ann hughes was bespoken to the aforesaid rowland who was indeed her bachelor and kinsman she stood before me like a pretty fury stamping her foot and swearing she had done wrong ever to take notice of a clown fit only for the society of waitingmaids she bade me go find doll in the kitchen and in a storm of anger entering her chamber she shut and bolted the door tis eleven of the clock and my master is just come home perturbed enough when i told him what had befallen but presently up he goes to make his excuses as best he may yet do i thank the stars which had made me this night but plain william hewer a bachelor

soul for deb cares no more for my master than she doth for the king though indeed she suffers him about her as and the more is the pity all maids must who enter into condition in the house of a man

friendly when we meet on the steps near pauls churchyard by the bench under the yewtree where she do tell me her troubles and of our masters everlasting running afterherwhich is a shame in the house he having so many out of doors but tis little i can do for deb willet my duty lying to my mistress who as is her nature cannot abide her for indeed they are much too alike to agree of two pretty women in a house one must have the mastery and it is my lady mistress who will not bear with deb the maid is 1 think well enough content to have a lad of her own age about the house and doth confide much in me yea kissing me very kindly from the very first day as she had oppor tunity or i could make one but suchlike favours not being as yet so scarce with me i do not set them all down in shorthand lest i should never come by another as my master doth thinking poor fool  that nobody is the wiser for if my mistress be jealous of master saxiiuel and leads him an vail life by night in the daytime she is

chamberdoor crying and begging me to abide for my kind masters sakewhich i always do ah little he guesses what he owes me in the way of peaceful homecomings and cheerful readings of nepotisme which puts him and us all to sleep but there is no right gratitude in man mr pepys cherishes me chiefly because my summations are correct and that i do set his tangier accounts in proper order for binding yet he owes me much more than that and most likely will never knoow it yet i care not let others be mercenary an theyl will i labour for the virtue which is its own reward for last lords day i did

from one woman to the other like a pasha which makes me laugh within meyea and outwardly too heaven forgive me when i did catch debs eye or my ladys for our samuel is ever jealous of the wrong fly in his apothecarys ointmentas formerly of posturing jack pembleton the dancing master and lately my mistress and i have sent a piping bombastical fellow named sheres across his bows as they say in the office to draw his fire he is so everlastingly dawdling after his knepps and worse that if any trim lad talks five minutes with my mistress or deb he will sulk for days for as the saying is as you do yourself so you dread your neighbour  but since i ceased to go to her fathers in longacre with my mistress mr pepys pays no heed to my comings and goings especially since i have entered upon the wvellfurnished lodgings of mine own which ve all find to be mighty convenient times and seasons being observed so little doth samuel know of the ways of women that he did actually send me with a letter which he had written to deb willet after she was gone calling her evil names at his wifes desire and to satisfy her so i did show the letter first to deb to break her of any folly that might be in her mind about a man who would not stand to his deeds but let the brunt fall on a girl then having served i brought the original back to samuel for his comfort onl first swearing my mistress to secrecy and the bridling of her tongue i let her know what mr pepys had sent me to do with the letter so though he hath great honour at the navy office and is the great man with my lord duke master samnuel is under sad eclipse where most he desires to shinethat is with his womenfolkthe reason being that lie is over subtle while a plain man though a clerk call take the wall off him by mere simplicity of dealing it gives inv mistress who hath a pretty teasing wit and is ever ready for revelige mighty pleasure to say to her husband when he comes home m2r pepys what a wonderful thing is providence today while out in the coach who should get in beside me you know how light of foot these travelled men are but master sheres or perhaps if it hath rained today being in the row buying green watered moire who should i light upon but mr sheres who most kindly walked home with me  all which is only a little tat  for samuels tit and pleases mi miistress mightily yet all this trouble i take for no advantage to myself but only that i may be a good chief clerk to my master and eke my mistresss most faithful bachelor because i do desire that my master reform his ways and cease to dance doll tearsheet corantos athwart london which indeed is most unseemly for the secretary of his majesty s navy surely the warning of mny mistress is not to be set down against ine as though i were a common informer as for our sins my master is old enough to know better and i young enough to repent when my time comesthough even now i wear my fools cap with a difference as to nmy dear mistress there is none like her for beauty she is worth all whitehall for wit the city cannot show her like had i such a wife wild horses would not draw me from home of nights but theresamuels gravelstones will not kill him much this side of a hundred and my dear ladys repute is as dear to me as my own credit for an honest man so i will abide by her yes for her sake and for a little of his own being as he is a foolish loveable inan i will abide by samuel ior niy dear mistress is hot of soul full of fine quick angers as often causeless as not and i love her for them as one may a child petulant and freshlipped if any try to hold her as like as not she will peck and bite like a wild bird caught in the hands none knows her so well as i being long of the house and as it were of her faction often have i desired to write fully of her thoughts and sufferingsaye and may do so some day because she had the daintiness of an english rose with the lightness and sparkle of her french epernay wineat once light heady and headstrong but it may be that between her husband and i we will keep her memory green for truth it is and i own it samuel also doth love her well perhaps in spite of his corantos better than any this credit i do him and with the more grace that i know well it is to me and not to him that she owes her chosen happiness for she calls me her sparrowhawk and when she beats up into an anger i fly into one ten times as fierce and sudden wxhen she vapours i overvapour her till she weeps when she scolds i storm when she is petulant i grow violent thus she loves me as save for her continued jealousies she doth never samuel yet for all that i cannot break her of these tempers it is pierce this and knepp  that if he comes in a quarterofan hour latewomen that are not worth the filip of her own rosy forefinger and indeed the poor man hath not the spirit to bid her go hang and mind her own businessas i should and do who am not her husband when she vexes me about deb willet but samuel sits like a calf behind a dripping hedge that waits for the storm to blow over poor man i have it in my heart to be sorry for him at times so simple he is and thinks himself so clever yet suffers my lady to ride roughshod over him which however is useful to me as pointing the difference between us making her prefer him who says go and be hanged i  and so slamns the doorto snailbacked samuel who crawls at her feet weeping as often as she hath caught him at his tricks so it was in this business of her tirewoman and companion deb it has been a grievous discomfortable time and the house barely fit to eat meat in for what with crying of rack and ruin treachery and vengeance from mistress elizabeth pepys and samuel on the crawl among the tablelegs beseeching his wife to tread upon him bah i it makes me sick to my soul and i do pet and confort deb every day and have found her a good convenient lodging and byandby she shall have a better place i took her box on1 my shoulder before the very face of my mistress who dared not vent her fury on both samuel and me at once but i do fear she banks it up all the more fiercely against poor debto whom however henceforward it will matter but little at saying of the final goodbye i did even take debs hand and set my lips to it this i did with intent because my lady looks best in a pretty french fury all white with scarlet spot on1 each cheekbone and her eyes sparking like mr hobbes lightnling machine ah it was a rare sight indeed and for a mall that could stand up to it something to be lived for but samuel who grovelled knew nothing about such pleasures how indeed should he for ever knighterranting hither and thither like a roaming grimalkin alas that i should write such words about my dear master or would i save in my secret notanda and to be upsides with him who doubtless doth grievously comb my hair in his many quartos but with deb round the corner and my mistress on tiptoe uncertain whether to embrace or poignard me surely i can afford to be generous yes a good fellow is sam of the navy office but in the matter of women he loveth not wisely but too many so is rightly beloved of none not knowing the art concerning which i william hewer his clerk could draw him certain sealed orders which poor wretch 1 he would not have the sense to act upon for true it is that once a gadabout always a gadabout and samuel follows one woman only until another croses the trail love with our samuel is no more and no less than a childrens game of crosstag led through london streets by players who have never seen each other before yet doth he serve his friends wellthat is so long as they be men and for the others i would rather not be a woman friend of samuels because of the reasons foreanent stated june 4th 1703i have just returned to my house in clapham from the vault near the communion table in the church of the crutched friars in which place i did make my eternal farewells to my oldest friend mr samuel pepys once my dear master the husband of my yet dearer mistress and of late my comrade and partneras he was good enough to style himselffor long dwelling under my roof and so deigning to accept the kindly gratitude of his ancient pupil and chief clerk when i glance at the leaves i wrote fourandthirty years ago i declare i do not know myself for the same man then i was an illconditioned selfconceited coxcombworthy neither of the consolatiomis of my dear mistress nor the lighter favours of mistress willet who in due time married her cousin archibald and died respected by all the landlady of the jolly postboy inn on the bristol road strange it is to think that deb kept her light head and easy ways so long above the daisies when within a year of my writing down all these fancies elizabeth pepys the like of whom the sun hath never since shone on was carried out to st olaves church in our parish of the crutched friars ave a broken man was her husband my master and as for me who was but her servant i never rightly cared to look on woman since and even unto this last year of grace two old men were used to steal in the grey light of the tenth of a london november to st olaves church and stand there a long while bareheaded he at the head and i at the feet now they two lie together wife and husband mayhap more contentedly than they ever did in their hot youth and i being left alone will go my pilgrimage from claphain twice a year instead of once on the day of his death and on hers yet do i think my master ever kept a little sting of jealousy against his servant perhaps as suspecting me of having revealed his doublings about deb and othersperhaps oil account of my dear mistress herself 1 know not for in his will he left me nought but fifty pounds and a mourning ring as he did to the very servants of my house but the truth is a man will forgive all differencesonerniig god man fortune doctrine angers politic and slights personalsave only the offence that cometlh like that first one of eden by a woman betwixt mans and man this is the sin unpardonable yet god knows it is with the kindest of thoughts in my heart that i turn my mourning ring upon my

i the strength of the hills by halliwell sutcliffe stanley paul and co 6s there is much to be said for  the strength of the hills both in their actual existence and in this work of mr halliwell sutcliffes for here the strength itself is represented by rural and undefiled nature defended as it were by the agriculturalist against the encroaching terror of the millowner and such other beings to whom nature is nought and industrial profit all things mr sutcliffe has given us the romance of the squire his retainers and his opponents with admirable insight and sympathy there are portions of the book which lead us to believe that he has been influenced however unconsciously just a little by the works of arnold bennett if this be so none can regret it for the romance of the strength of the hills is absorbing and the incidents accruing from the juxtaposition of the mills and their men to the fields and their men to say nothing of the necessary women gives ample scope for the authors talent  the strength of the hills bv halli ell sutditle 6s stanlen paul other english districts have beeni annexed as it were by the novelist we coul1 an we wvould give two good instances of what we mean  but yorkshire is fortunate today in having her folk her customs and her scenerv described by three storytellers who are nativeborn wve dllu le of course t 4 mr oliver onions to mr j s fletcher aitl to mr lhalliell sutclifte f these three writersall of whomn have slhowin a tendency to hark back to the yorkshire of the ealyr nineteenth cent urv kr sutcliffe is the onie who still rcimains staunch and true to his owi count he refuses to breathe the rarer attar of town life and continues to dev ote himself to the writing of the rural romance his new storv the strength of the hills might indeed be called a pastoral but for the vein of quiet irony that runs through it it is the tale of a young squire who sees to his horror the flood of industrialism sweeping over the moors he loves so wvell and compelling the folk of the opell air to herdl in factories anl mills for a long time he makes every effort to stem the tide and refuses to part with all acre of ground to the millowners  but in the enll thanks to the necessity of repairing a wrong done years ago by his father he is forced to the necessity of erecting a factory himself and of labouring incessantl to make it pav a course which wellnigh involves him in a fatal misunderstanding with the girl he loves his latest novel shows mr sutcliffe ill a quieter and soberer style thaln the one lhe generally adopts it is however none the less appealing oii that account we doubt indeed whether even in his miost flamboyant romlances this author has afforded so admirable an example of the yorkshiremans grit doggedness and capacity for getting there as is lresented by the hero of the strength of the hills,history_contra
the red republic a romance of the commune by robert w chambers putuams sons mr chambers has evidently spared no pains in his effort to render his story of paris in 1871 as realistic as possible apart from the perusal of a number of works on the period he has had the good fortune to consult a copy of the official records of the commune and in addition has been coached up by  revolutionary friends of belleville la villette and the faubourgs montmartre and st antoine on the whole the results if a little overcrowded by detail are decidedly effective mr chambers provides us with a rich feast of horrors and heroism of fanaticism and ferocity in the marvellous succession of hairbreadth escapes which fall to the lot of hero heroine and three or four more of the erincipal characters he somewhat forfeits is claims to be regarded as a realist but few readers will complain of the romantic improbabilities which lighten the prevailing gloom of this stirring but bloodboltered narrative,history

that he was clear of london    they were now in the open country the houses were very few and scattered at long intervals often miles apart occasionally they came upon a cluster of poor cottages some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children rom the road others shut up close while all tne family were working in the fields these were often the commencement of a little village and after an interval came a wheelwrights shed or perhaps a blacksmiths forge then a thriving farm with sleepy cows wing about the yard and horses peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses passed upon the road as though in triumph at their freedom there were dull pigs too turning up thc ground in search of dainty food ann grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about or crossed each other in their quest plump pigeons skimming round the roof or strutting on the eaves and ducks and geese far more graceful in their own conceit

parsons at whose dread names the ber shop trembled the church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees then there were a few more cottages then the cage and pound and not uofreauently on a bank by the wayside a deep old dusty well then came the trimhedged nelda on either hand and the open road again the concluding passages of the number are yet more striking for a quaint originality of

when knighthood was in flower by edin cas koden 6s sands there could scarcely be a more temptirg subject for the writer of romance than the lovestory of charles brandon son of a simple knight of suffolk and the princess mary sister of henry viii nor could it we think be more charmingly set mr charles major edwin caskoden forth than in the quaint language of sir edwin caskoden henrys gay little 1 master of the dance only it is well to make it clear that the book is not an historical study it is a lovestory pure and simple and its appeal is to the readers heart rather than to his head it is the widest appeal however and no doubt the example of the fifty thousand americans who have already enjoyed the book will be followed eagerly by as many britons the beautiful and wilful princess has an imperious charm which few will be able to resist and her maid of honour lady jane bolingbroke is only second to her mistress to us indeed she is a more attractive character just as her gallant and determined little knight wins more of our regard than brandon himself who seems a trifle overpowered by the insistence of the princesss wooing the book is full of gaiety and vivacity for sir edwin kas an infectious lightheartedness the author is to be especially congratulated oal the personality of his  chronicler whose innocent and cheerful egotism is one of the most refreshing touches in a bright and delightful story,history
8b branetp hose or camlaer and imuwords by a ofx auwhos of lts rjectp addram 3 tls cofthis novel has speedily reached a second edition it has been much read and talked of it is ridiculous affectation we think to deny that the author is not an imitator of the popular novels from which so plentiful an harvest of fame and of something more substantial than fame has been gathered in the sly paragraphs in which the curious coincidence of the two writers treating at the same time of the same political events is roundly stated is evidence enough that mlr smith would wish to be considered as a disciple of the ad great unknown and in good truth be has been largely indeted to the la hours of his magnus apollo his redundant exemplor the whole volumes are pant with that happy imitation which is the peculiar forte of the i author of the rejected addresses to which volume so far as it rcspects the power of successful parody brambletye house forms an appropriate appendage the sources from whence the largesd gleanings have been made for the materials of this work are the historical novels of the author of waverley passim from evelin and pepys amost every historical fact worth the using has been transcribed with occa sional acknowledgment manuscripts have been searched and old records rifled and with much laborious reseatch and patient industry three very entertaining volumes have been concocted we shall be quite satisfied if mr smith will pursue his career of successful paroly with the same talent and though we cannot award him the high honours of inventive genius we are quite sure that all which he does will be worth the reading and since the giant of romance has ceased to come forth in his strength we may be amused by the efforts of those who by the mechanical aid of bolstering and of stilts present us with a lively portraiture of the reposing prototype the work commences at the close of the protectorate and embraces a periol comprehending the better i e the

the first volume we next find jocelyn the hero of the history in paris where under due superintendence and good society he qualifies himself for an accompished cavalier and a good officer it was here that he received from his father the glorious news of the restorationbut brambletye house having been disposed of by the committee of sequestration jocelyn is desired to remain in the french metropolis until his fathers difficulties are removed during his sojourn here louis xiv in the prime of youth and beauty procaimed his intention of ratifying the knights and lidies of is court with a tournament surpassing in splendour all that had preceded it on this occasion jocelyn after the most approved mode in these case provided although but a squire is suddenly called into action in violation of the laws of chivalry and unhorses his opponent amidst the accla mation of the multitude here it is that the sensitive heart of jocelyn receives its first wound from a pair of 4 lustrous black eyes gazing upon hint after his achievement and he at taches himself to his unknown inamorata with a chivalrous constancy which secures him from the intoxicating influence of a dissipated metropolis his attempts to discover the lady are vain and he is recalled to england where he finds his father has married a dutch woman of the unpronounceable name of luffrouv wugshaael the widow of a schudam fisherman the process by which this connexion was formed is highly comic but the effects on the poor baronet are disastnus enough cut off by the penurious habits of his consort from every accustomed comfort and the last man to he satisfied with begsarly cheer the gambling of his stomac express itwif very inteiligibly by his lips and a ludicrous state of domestic tyranny is the result of this unhappy union like most of the cavaliers who attached themselves to the monarch in his misfortunes sir john expnences the neglect of the court son however finding brambletye house tont at all to his taste under the tyranny of his dutch stepmother comes to london with a letter of introduction to the celebrated lord rochester and after some maneuvres on the part of that aristocratic eccentric obtains an interview with tie king who confers on him the appointment of vice chamberlain to the queen he is now duly installed at court and the licentious profligacy that resided there is very minutely detailed on the warrant of the best historical evidence but we are tracing thie progress of the novel too minutely for those who love to be surprised and we fear that we way be weakening the effect by anticipation we will therefore omit what occurred at court and the cause which made the hero again a fugitive from his country he is consigned by the kindness of a friend to a dutch burgomaster in whose daughter he discovered his longlost inamorata  of the lustrous black eyes we will not attempt to trace our hero through the subsequent bustling scenes in which he was doomed to act and suffer with all his passionate idolatry for an unknown being there was too much of ethereal purity in the discovered heroine to attract or fix an earthly passion in the marshes of haelbecki he finds a more congenial love in the friend of the highsouled constantia the third volume is more replete with interest than its precursors the drawsatis persona are all congreaated on english ground the usual forerunner of a denouement and after escapings the pestilence and the fire and sundry moving accidents from court intigue the story terminates happily for all those in whose fate the reader feels an interest it was a hazardous attempt we think in the author to introduce such characters as milton marvel and lsc walton nor can we compliment him on his success charles aud rochester are

noblesse oblige novels and novelettes by sarah tytler 3 vols hurst  blackett vestinays martyrdom a story of the catacombs by emma raymond pitman hodder  stoughton the spanish barber by the author of mary powell nisbet  co perhaps the latest production of miss tytler an author not without experience might have been fraught with more interest to the general reader if the necessities of custom had not required that the matter of half a volume should be spread out into three taking the most favourable view of noblesse oblige the best friends of its author could scarcely venture to say that it offers anything of engrossing interest either in the characters or in the story yet there are glimpses here and there of humour and intention especially where the author does not attempt too high a flight in the social scale which might have formed as it were the cadre of a good story before the sevenfold process of dilution was applied small countrytown scenes and society might have afforded a good deal of amusement at least we should imagine so from the description of the misses medlar the twicefour blooming daughters of the  first attorney in wellfield  the low and vulgar wellfield wags we are told multiplied the number of the miss medlars to forty the forty miss medlars j then by a natural and wicked association they had changed the miss medlars into thieves the forty thieves innocent though they were of stealing mens hearts they were tall stout passably goodlooking girls their bane was plethora in constitution as well as number few men could serenely contemplate a wife of eleven stone weight any more than thirtynine sistersinlaw happy had it been if miss tytler had traced out the lives of these smalltown beauties instead of giving way to that alluring form of ambition which forces a certain class of novelists in spite of nature and in defiance of art to draw highlife groups for which assuredly they have never had any proper models what can we expect when we find colloquial phrases not used in the upper classes or in any educated class cropping up to the surface continually in certain parts of the book lord wriothesleys illness had seemed nothing out of the common she seems to be learning to live without rest or refreshment of any kind for as small and frail as she is  once they had arrived and got a cup of tea she would be able to chat with phoebe  she felt a vast deal better already and able for any amount of gossip i am glad i have got anything i wanted and am the better of we take these singular specimens of english as we find them here and there and we have only to observe that they are not placed in the mouths of persons supposed to be uneducated or even of the misses medlar but that they proceed either directly from the author or from the more refined personages of the story including the countess of exmoor and her daughter the lady dorothea latimer it is wonderful how the author identifies herself with the great latimers and how she despises the small latimers otherwise  the essex latimers who will succeed to the title in consequence of the death of lady dorotheas brother lord wriothesley yet these despised latimers are kind enough to give a home to lady dorothea who conde scends while utterly despising them and calling them commonplace goodish sort of people to avail herself of the accommodation of their house for the purposes of her wedding the difference between the present earls family and the relatives who are to succeed him and who are of course of the same aristocratic stock is surely a difference twixt tweedledum and tweedledee but the author revels in such a difference and so far from exhibiting it as a personal prejudice in the mouth of one of her characters makes herself a party to it in the most uncompromising and glaring manner in short miss tytler is an oligarch to the backbone except in one particular point and there nature creeps out the two heroines of the story lady dorothea and miss phoebe pas ton are both wooed by men of rank yet they both condescend to marry men of far inferior positions thus the independence of the sex is vindicated and the authors female conscience is saved it will be better for her readers and herself if in future works she makes her matter in some degree commensurate with her space and abstains from the attempt to describe phases of society with which her acquaintance is evidently imperfect passing to the second work on the above list we come to a tale of other times but one which is also of serious earnest quality as almost all visitors to rome have joined a party to see the catacombs and have made their way through the narrow passages lined with the empty restingplaces of early christians pausing now to observe a phial of blood now some ancient device on the wall it is likely that the present story will revive many interesting associations miss pitman promises to introduce us to the life of that roman community which was addressed in an epistle and was visited by st paul and which dragged out a troubled and anxious existence under the shadow of the emperor nero vestina who gives her name to the story is a noble roman maiden aud a convert to christianity at first she keeps her religious change a secret but after a time her mother and her brother follow her example and they are martyred before her but there are other and much more important characters in the story miss pitman tells us at the end that many of the incidents here recorded are historical facts and could have been presented in a series of historical chapters but to many minds the thin disguise of fiction is more attractive and to many more the dry historical account seems repulsive while they will welcome the same information in this form it is for this reason no doubt that st paul himself is brought on the stage and that we are shown the apostle during his first visit to rome arguing with the jews and preaching to christians in the hired house where he was suffered to dwell with the soldier who had charge of him several names mentioned in st pauls epistles occur also in the story onesimus demas alexander the coppersmith take a prominent part on the whole miss pitmans work is a fair sample of the religious historical story there is a certain superficial verisimilitude in the use made of the smallest biblical hints and in the working out of characters whose names and leading peculiarities alone are mentioned by the apostle miss pitman enters sometimes into the spirit of her story and the description of  vestinas martyrdom or rather of her timely release from martyrdom is simple and touching when we are told however that the facts presented to us might have occupied a series of historical chapters we feel bound to point out the abundance of grave errors in the historical parts of the story miss pitman has apparently taken her dates from the margin of her bible and seeing there that st paul arrived in rome ad 63 and that the epistle to philemon was written a year later she has not scrupled to bring in the story of onesimus the slave and to describe his being sent back to his master even with these materials before her she has made a mistake for in this epistle st paul speaks of demas as his fellowlabourer while according to miss pitman demas had already forsaken the apostle but the other facts which have to tally with these dates are still more unfortunately chosen we read that in ad 63 vespasian had defeated the jews vespasian was not sent against them till the year 66 nero is represented in the same year as accompanied by his young wife octavia he had put her away the year before and had married poppaja a few days afterwards the late attempt to rehabilitate nero seems to have led miss pitman to state that he set the city on fire to satisfy a brutal jest  as is now universally believed from corroborative testimony the peculiar felicity of the word  now  appears most strongly when we remember that modern criticism has shaken what ancient historians believed but if in this case ancient opinions are attributed to the moderns modern words are in return ascribed to the ancients miss pitman talks incomprehensibly of the  bagnio or public way to what language does she think that word belongs  yet even this is outdone by the statement that the part of rome lying beyond the tiber was called in ad 63 the trastevere what possible sense that name could have till the river itself had become the italian tevere instead of the latin tiber or tiberinus we must leave to miss pitman to discover when she says too that  to dwell in the trastevere was to be accounted among the scum and offscouring of the inhabitants we cannot but feel for the good name of that friend of horaces who lived far across tiber near caesars gardens after these specimens of miss pitmans mistakes we need hardly add that the laliclavu8 or broad stripe was not worn on the toga or upper garment but on the tunica or under garment that pan was a greek deity and not  the god of the country among the romans and that the lupercalia were not festivities in his honour but were offered to the god of fertility accuracy on these points is a minor consideration though it was hardly necessary for miss pitman to enter into details which she could not verify her other blunders are much more serious and affect the value of her book we abandon neither serious purpose nor grave mistakes when we come to the third of the above works in punch for the year 1844 will be found one of those humorous paragraphs illustrated with quaint woodcuts by thackeray and called forth by a statement in the times of the day to the effect that some british society had hit upon a novel plan of introducing tracts into spain viz by bottling them securely corked these same bottles were cast adrift at the entrance of the bay of cadiz and being washed on shore by the tide found their way landwards through the medium of the sailors  so no doubt  reported the agents of the parent society thackerays humorous paper is in the form of a remonstrance addressed to espartero then an exile in england there are three illustrations no 1 depicts a sailor waistdeep in the sea clutching a bottle floating towards him on the crest of a wave  rum praps exclaims the excited salt no 2 the same sailor on shore a fellow salt and a boy personating audience he is in the act of inserting the screw into the cork and exclaims  sherry i hope no 3 in withdrawing the cork he finds some paper adhering and with disappointment dismay and contempt depicted on his countenance exclaims  tracts by jingo the title of this book the spanish barber by the author of  mary powell suggested  rum praps and a perusal of the table of contents and the first chapter led to sherry i hope this chapter has much of the power of this quaint and original writer but a further perusal induced disappointment and the exclamation of tracts by jingo involuntarily escaped our lips miss mannings story is evidently written for the purpose of what is termed in the exeter hall vernacular  doing the good work a certain lay figure is set for the converted sinner who goes on converting other sinners in a style of simple addition quite delightful to contemplate given a spanish barber locality gibraltar who shaves a lay figure named caravantes probably so called because the barber quotes cervantes and boasts that he knows the adventures of the knight of la mancha by heart proverbs and all the shavee converts the shaver at once the shaver his wife they quote

nation of snobs whose pitiful abject snobbishness is far more deeply ingrained than anything that theray for mere fus ske described  or must we say that the picture is morbidly unnatural and that an intelligent and clever woman who has written some good literature has made a blunder and overreached herself in aiming at strong artistic effect  the latter alternative is the less humiliating of the

leaders of englih politics must necessarily spring from the old tic families and young lord wriothesley is the coming hero he is to gain for the exmoors the glory of great reputation and his sister lady dorothea is to strengthen the family by a rich match lord wriothesley is rather infirm of purpose for instead of passing reform bills and organising emigration schemes he falls in love in a sort of helpless fashion with phoebe paston the artists daughter lady dorothea on the other hand knows her duty and performs it she is about to may a lord fairchester whom she does not particularly love then she gets to love him very much then it turns out that there is a mistake in the title atid then the young woman who is represented as a miracle of goodness aned kindness and honor turns him off  if lord fairchester is reduced to john blount she observes tranquilly to phxebe he will be no match for dorothea latimer owe exmoors have always sacrificed our private feelings and had not to do with mwial1iianvx when she parts with her lover she informs him that their two souls are united for ever which means we presume that her delicate sense of honour will not prevent her marrying her body to somebody else meanwhile lord wriothesley dangles after the artists daughter much to the discomfort of her other lover an artist whose only comfort is that wriothesley is a good young man and means no harm he had no doubt thwt lard wriothesley was of such a set whitewashed and vituos os became a latimer but man enough to have his iudividual tastes although peer enough to hanker after forbidden fruit lord wriothesley could not have phoebe paston mny more than the prince of wales could have had her but he could admire her court her and dangle after her in a dilettante virtuous iatimer fasbion only robbing her of her virgin fancy her maiden meditations the first bloom of her heart phoebe is a curious young woman who has occasional fits of satllennew and frequent fits of loquacity strangely enough she has a horror of reviewers and rates them so sudly that in selfhumiliation we cannot forbear to quote her speeches it must be said however that phoebe has just been paid a visit by her

preferring the wines at the gartick club to those of lord exmoor phoebes father is an artist of great reputation who looks upon himself as a sort of vassal or serf of the exmoor family the other characters are unhmportant now it would seem that the great occupation in life of these people is to talk of the differences of class indeed the word  class  crops up in these  pages until we get heartily sick of it two women almost strangers meet hurriedly in the street they have not seen each other for some time and the one asks the other how she likes the place phoebe replies that she has every reason to speak well of the people whereupon mrs edgecumbe immediately points out that such people are necessarily unknown to her  you see i have known my class these thousand years and the other is not at all in my way poor phoebe she is beset on all sides by  class  and it is an open question whether one ought to be more ashanied of the despicable titleworship on the part of her neighbours or more disgusted with the profound selfconsciousness of rank on the part of her grand friends lord exmoors family talk as if they had just acquired their patent of no bty and were overcome by the new sensation even the mild and characterless lord wriothesley when he visits phoebes father has to beg that there will be no fuss made about him and hopes that paston will not turn courtier but the oddest exhilbitions of this feeling occur in its reflex action upon the people around phoebe is writing to lady dorothea and she says is it not the boast of the ermoora that they have once and again at such seasons jeopardied lands and life for king and country  may not we follow at a distance and hazard in our turn our small private fortunes for the credit of our friends and our class is there no noblesse oblige in the middle rank and the mercantile world also p forgive me for likening myself to you lady dorothea but i wish you could see my uncle now he sets himself to breast the blast and begin life anew with my aunt standing by and fairly for etting that she used to take a great deal out of him and demand special consideration from him for being a wingfield of batty and wingfield a norman mercantile house in these parts lady dorothea now more eagerly deferential to him than i could have imagined a woman a little hard and exacting in her better days could under any circumstances become  a norman mercantile house  is excellent elsewhere phoebe remarks of her titled friends  they are great people and as such perfectly exceptional no more to be measured by small people in their actions and the consequences of their actions than kings are to be measured it was probably owing to her deference to this divine right of great people that phoebe although she loved barty wooler and was by him beloved invariably snubbed him in order to remain single and let lord wriothesley flirt with her indeed she looks forward to the certainty of his proposing to her and she allows her neighbours to talk of the match as settled without taking any particular thought as to what she must do should he be so indiscreet phoebe has a great liking for lord wriothesley but then she is of opinion that  love and love alone can cross securely the chasm between clas and class and so she allows matters to drift apparently hoping that lord wriothesley would marry her and yet not removing barty wooler too far out of reach finally lord wriothesley dies and then she falls back upon barty and marries him she admits that she might have married lord wriothesley  out of pure gratitude loyalty and reverence but that her heart was b alty s the time we hope barty liked the position dy dorotheas affairs end in a marriage also for she at last resolves to recall the dicared mr

this new production of the most fertile imagination ofthe day because it will spare a world of criticism as a tale the fortunes of nigel is a mere abortion and the author is so conscious of it that he

the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political emergencies before his accession to the throne of england and the sole business of the story is to relate nis fortunes tn a journey to london to induce honest king james to repay it here we roust

accidental but it is an accident from which our northern brethren are so genet all preserved we have hitherto concluded that its avoid ance might be safely left to instinct the story opens iu the very best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it is accounted for while physically accurate is certainly imaginatively disgusting contrary however to all anticipation abe does not prove to be the heroine and the lady who is so is after all only a diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public will be extremely

in high places by m e braddon hutchin son  cosaul among the prophets is scarcely so surprising a spectacle as miss braddon among the historical novelists at least to those who remember her in the days of 4lady audleys secret eleanors victory and such palpitating volumes it is better however to write an historical than an hysterical novel if the line of writing must be changed and we are grateful that the first has been chosen in 4london prideand again in this present book she deals not with modern villainy injured innocence or ennui but with old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago historical novels are just now legion because even the novelist of the simplest type thinks it a point of honour to prove his versatility by a specimen of the genus plenty of models and easier access to sources of information of course help the fashion many of these novels are it is true models rather of what the historical should not be than the reverse still others of a better kind are not infrequent on the whole in high places belongs we should say to the latter species yet there is much that is tiresome and a good deal that is unnecessary the author has to some extent read well and wisely but the reduction of her material would have still further proved it the tragic days of our own charles have been chosen and many great figures are introduced though not invariably in person buckingham mazarin the queen of france are some of those met face to face also members of an artistic parisian coterie not found in many novels of the epoch the matter is certainly varied  would we could add that it is as vivid as varied interesting passages and wellpresented situations occur but mixed with much that is to speak frankly the reverse of entertaining no real excitement can be got up over the fortunes and misfortunes of george mountain though perhaps because he invariably does the right thing and expresses the correct sentiment miss braddon may be at least congratulated on the facility she shows in her new departure an enemy to the king by r n stephens methuen  co possesses at least as much interest as the most successful of the many recent romances of the kind its main features are those which are commonly found in these stories it is written in the form of autobiography it involves love and fighting alternately in nearly every chapter and it concludes with the promise of happiness for the most worthy of the dramatis persona it is a story of the days of the league and of the due de guise and henry of navarre and so far as the subject only is concerned it has just as much right to be called the story of a gentleman of france as any similar work of fiction the bulk of the book is concerned with the years 157885 its distinguishing feature is the care with which the writer describes the persons of the leading characters such as henry iii guise and henry of navarre and these portraits in prose are worthy of the attention of those to whom historical novels are still attractive we can recall none in which this element of interest is more prominent or more interesting it would be unjust to outline the plot which is fairly original and logically worked out the writer is an adept at describing a duel the dialogues are not the most satisfactory portions of the book though expletives and words of exclamation are never used wrongly it should be mentioned that the subtitle of the book describes the story as drawn from the recently discovered memoirs of the sieur de la tournoire  the name of the hero in places there is a suspicion of a ladys

  the seats of the mighty by gilbert parker methuen  co mr parker seems to become stronger and easier with every serious novel that he attempts good though some of his earlier efforts were there was generally a sense of  tightness  to use an expression borrowed from drawing about his works which to some extent marred their effect he also has had a tendency to study somewhat abnormal and ingenious characters for which he is in no way to be reproached although it to a certain extent exaggerated in him an inclination to artificiality however singularities such as these are no faults but rather merits in a young author for the worst thing they produce is overelaboration a failing soon cured by time and experience in  the seats of the mighty mr parker shows the matured power which his former novels have led us to expect and has produced a really fine historical novel the scene of course is laid in canada and the central fact chosen is the glorious capture of quebec by general wolfe mr parker perhaps wisely does not make the general the chief figure in his story but he shows enough of him to make more intelligible and real the extraordinary heroism and attraction in this physically weak man i but the great creation of the book is doltaire the bastard of a french king and a peasant woman who combines in an extraordinary manner the dignity courtesy and cynicism of the old court with the rude directness and occasional savagery of the soil his character is drawn with quite masterly strokes for he is a villain who is not altogether a villain and who attracts the reader as he did the other characters by the extraordinary brilliancy of his gifts and by the almost unconscious acts of nobility which he performs there is nothing overdone about him  ono can understand fully why he was so successful and why he almost succeeded in fascinating the heroine and one can equally understand the loathing felt for him by the hero capt moray and his fine doath is not unworthy of his life capt moray himself is by no means the shadowy creature that the hero of an historical novel is apt to be his sufferings in prison are well told and his exploits during the escape down the st lawrence river and in his brief return to quebec are almost worthy of dumas for their foolhardy ingenuity most sincerely is mr parker to be congratulated on the finest novel he has yet written,history

i doctor antonio a tale ly the author of i  lorenzo benoni edinburgh thomas constable and co 1855 paris galignani and co tie object of this talc evidently is to beget a higher appreciation of the italian character than commonly prevails in this country in a word to convince our purseproud and acreproud tourists that the bearded anld conicalhatted gentry among whom they travel when they visit the pleasant scenes of sunny italy are not necessarily scamps and adventurers the materials used are not perhaps very novel as our readers will at once understand when we come to relate the plot of the story but they are so skilfully managed and are woven together in such a masterly style that the attention is riveted at once and the interest inspired is precisely that which we feel when we suspect that the story may be true in a word doctor antonio is a tale in a thousand and we shall be greatly surprised if it d not prove to be one of the greatest and most abiding favourites which the light literature of this year has produced sir john davenne a wealthy english baronet i and his daughter lucy a delicate exotic from our social forcinglhouses are travelling from genoa to nice runaway

wills it or no lucy is obliged to be taken to an osteria at bordighera where she remains for many weeks now doctor antonio looks too much like rinaldo lrinaldini to suit sir john davennes taste and moreover the worthy baronet is not  very well pleased at being compelled to stay at ia miserable steria miss lucy however does i not sympathise with these feelings she knows that doctor antonio has been kind to her she appreciates the great worth of his character she sees th ceaseless efforts that lhe makes for her good and to make a long story short at last she loves him not but what there is a spice of romance in the business 1octor antonio is  nobly born revolutionary troubles have driven him from sicilv wvhere his family were once i great and wealthy he is the high spirited intellectual truly noble man under difficulties and i lucy loves him none the less that his adopted  profession enables limn to cure her leg how i tendlerlv and skilfully this is effected with what art this ioctor

am quite in love with that docttor f you rs  a re vou   saili lucy looking tip to hini with such beamniii evesi i lhave seldom seen a more commanding tigure titan hii and he is very gemtlemanlike

pursued aubrey slowly in a clear cruel stern voice  as it is i would rather see you dead and buried than married to that man the little wateringpot slipped out of her hand and her knees gave way d  it  cried aubrey raising her from the ground  you deednt take fright at a mere supposition  and without another word he passed his powerful arm round his sisters waist and led her up the stairs to the sofa this was the first and last time that antonios name was mentioned between them and so the idyl ended lucy returned to england and after a time married a viscount antonio returned to sicily and joining in the last revolution shared the fate of poerio lucy lady cleverton eventually became a widow and sought italy with the view of once more finding doctor antonio she found him a prisoner and after a fruitless endeavour to obtain his liberation died of a broken heart 1doctor antonio says the author  still suffers prays and hopes for his country  doctor antonio  a tale by the author of lorenzo benoni edinburgh constable  co the same paris galignanithis book is superior as a work of interest to its predecessor constructed after the manner of manzoni there are certain lengthy details which might have been compressedbut the true and touching interest of the story would carry a reader through a much heavier medium indeed except that they interrupt the flow of the narrative the details are not devoid of an interest of their ownand will be read on a second perusal if skipped in the eardonable impatience of wishing first to know ow everything ends between doctor antonio and lucy who is one of the most charming impersonator of an english girl we have met with in the course of many novels the outline of the story is simple it derives its charm from the grace and delicacy with which the details are filled in and the strong individuality impressed upon every point of character scenery or incident the character of sir john davenne is an admirable little bit of comedy and there is a dash of genuine graceful fun about it that could scarcely have been given from an english point of view the gradual melting away of all the dear proud stiff old baronets prejudices and the consequent fair play that is given to his best qualities and his gradual conversion to his daughters faith in doctor antonio is charmingand so is the happy pastoral life they all leael during lucys convalescence as to the sudden manner in which it is brought to a close by the arrival of her brother we might say that it is the settingin of an east wind and a blighting frost in the midst of a soft spring day only that would be a commonplace simile after that point the story grows too sorrowful the events narrated are true and cannot on closing the book be forgotten or set aside as highlywrought incidents in a novel the interest that began in the simple overturn of a carriage and the consequent detention of the party at a small ostcria in sicily darkens and complicates into the political tragedy of the 15th of may 1848 the picture of the state of thingsthe trial of the prisoners given in all the naked detail of an official report makes the concluding pages of the story too painful for though ephemeral interest of a work of fiction and as a matter of art a novel has no business to wind up with a lengthened police report we suppose the author does not mind sacrificing his credit as a novelist to have the opportunity of keeping alive in the memory of english readers the details of events which heard imperfectly at the time may have become somewhat obscure and obliterated we cannot dismiss  doctor antonio without a word upon the pure and flexible style in which it is written the english is excellent and stands upon its own merits but when it is recollected that it is the english of a foreigner it becomes wonderful,history

had painted it it is a charming book minute in its details yet never tiring and so full as it were of slight masterly touches on the glaze of the picture that the reader is every now and then tempted to linger as he proceeds with the story to enjoy a second perusal of many of its pages lest some of these delicate touches should have escaped him as an illustration we quote the opening passage of the book the early summer of 1792 was ripening the wheatears and darkening the vine leaves about the hamlet of fayeauxjonquilles the season was too far advanced however for showing the appropriateness of its sweetsmelling name or for proving that it had contributed in its day to the four thousand crowns worth of jonquilles spent on the progress of the great monarch to chantilly which is pleasantly chronicled by that jonquille among french womenmadame de sevigne but say was lucky in more than its name of fayeamongthejonquilles it had plump wheaters instead of the shrivelled heads of rye which replaced at a later date the jonquilles that enamelled and perfumed the steps of the sublime louis its present proprietors had suffered less than some from the roadmaking the charge on salt and the

by walnut trees wound and clomb to the tour de faye giving one the impression that the village rose on tiptoe to curtsy to the feudal lord and master in spite of the prohibition of titles of rank by a national assembly and the flight of great flocks of nobles the tour was a true antique not setting its claim on massiveness or splendour it had the hoary picturesque grace of a grey lichen set between the green of the earth and the blue or daffodil or peabloom of the sky the walls were very thick and pierced with narrow windows they looked as if they might have stood sieges from the normans and the

style not in the sense of an acting play but of one written for the closet never straining after effect and every page adding fresh proof of the unusual power of the writer and of the careful pains and study she has bestowed upon her work differing in the details of its manipulation from that of the waverley series there is still the same key to its inspirationa thorough knowledge of the spirit of the time in which the action of the tale mioves rather than the reproduction of the dry bones of past events scott knew well this secret of his art and so made the historical novel his own and many as have been the attempts to follow in his footsteps as yet failure or at least but partial success has been the chief result stepping out of the beaten track of those who consider the historical novel rather as a chronicle of facts than as the exponent of thoughts miss tytler manages to centre the chief interest of the story around the changing fortunes of the owner of the old feudal tour de

but there could not be a huger mistake than to suppose him in consequence a nobody on the contrary wherever he went he became the presiding genius of the kitchen where asking and receiving cart blanche he installed himself in the admiring confidence of the chief of the department he entered so completely heart and soul into businessthrew himself so disinterestedly and generously into the choicest most recherche achievements for the entertainment of the chateau or hotel in which he was guest that like his less endowed marquise he emerged from his field of enterprise in a collapsed condition sat with halfclosed eyes or slumbered outright till the moment of trial when the fillet a la du barry or the salade i la volaille rewarded his great qualifications and covered him with glory then the marquis was at his culminating pointthen he not only carved and sent round a dish as a finished artiste would dispense it but he rendered it historical aesthetical poetical religious does the dish please you madame  i am ravished to hear ita bagatelle quite simplethe kernel of the affair had its birth at a lent supper of the great cardinals but let us await the souffletalso a virginal dish with a still more splendid origin this soufflet aux dattes was brought from egypt by no meaner personages than saint louis and marguerite of provence a spectator above all a convive could easily discover that the withered brighteyed old nobleman had lived at a time when dainty eating and famine were two of the institutions of france and when supper was one of the things to live for he was not malicious or tyrannical rather like most unrivalled men of science he was goodnatured and affable that he was likewise perfectly careless of all outside his own range was an unlucky not a remarkable abuse of his powers monsieur de lussac would really have preferred the whole universe to profit by his cftelettes and crmes since that was impossible he believed sincerely that men might as pivy i well perish of inanition as swallow garlic soup with a taste of artichokes the plot of the novel is well sustained to the end it never flags but like the larde snowball which boys delight in rolling on tilll it becomes an absorbing interest to all it leaves 11 pon the readers mind a sensation of regret that the last page has been reached when he comes to the end of the third volume ii citoyenne

of the ancienne uoblesse makes a mesalliawce by becoming the wife of michel sarte her fathers registrar or bailiff thii3 illassorted match not only precipitates her from her rank in society but brings with it much bitterness and heart suffering a mere child at the time she neither loves nor cares to understand her husband but marries him in a fit of despair or pique having been jilted by her cousin achille for a fascinating and wealthy widow michel sartes character bears a vague resemblance to that of john halifax he is brave noble hearted and generous and though a peasant by birth truly one of natures gentlemen the descriptions of life during the reign of terror evidently drawn from lamartines girondists and of the sad partings of the condemned at the foot of the guillotine are told with deep feeling and pathos few novels have afforded us so much pleasure in the perusal nor can we lay th e book aside without calling attention to the happy delineation of the subordinate characters of

hereward the wake  last of the english new novels by the rev c kingsley 2 vols macmillan co the good english novels based on the stories of ancient history could be told on our ten fingers among these we should reckon lockharts  valerius and moores  epicurean and crolys salathiel and william howitts avenger of blood and sir e lyttons last days of pompeii but not his  last of the barons elaborately wrought as was that story we allude to this romance purposely because mr kingsleys occupies analogous ground and because it is a good novel though in some small measure flawed by the personality of the taleteller he ie  would be at once ancient and modern he iy  cannot consent to merge kingsley in hereward in i in this unlike scott whose  ivanhoe was as d little scottish as if it had been written by some clerk belonging to an english monastery and whose want of selfconsciousness attested his greatness and creative facility almost as much the variety of types of character set forth by lines in right of which he ranks with shakespeare and moliere mr kingsley however must be forgiven for the mixture of styles and allusions which his chronicle contains because of the vigour with which he has grasped his central figure and has thrown himself back into the manners and scenery of an old world his hereward is real because of his incomplete rudenessa beautiful stalwart man with a strong right arm and a huge faith and a stout heart and yet a failing constancy when age comes on and sense and spirit are brought into duel we follow his adventures here gathered from the old chroniclers and arranged orderly and well according to the fashion of the time as shakespeare hath itwith implicit trust for these mr kingsley has had some warrant but not for the character in the book which divides its interest with herewardhis wifetorfrida this is capitally wrought out from a few outlines like the rude sketches on antique tapestry a strange complex living woman moving midway betwixt superstition religious devotion and affection has been evoked with a force and command over sympathy which no one can exercise save he be a master of his craft nothing can be better for a tale like this than the tinge of sorcery toyed with rather than believed in by torfridas self which gave a strange colour to her beauty and during a large part of two lives a strong influence over the child of nature and adventurer with whom she mated herself nothing can be more picturesque than the manner in which she vanishes from the tale at the period of her husbands life when he began to seek for rest and respectability and to long for another woman unless it be torfridas reappearance at the close when the song had ceased and the long day had closed and the strong right arm was stricken low and the faithful companion of the wild man in his hours of struggle and triumph flung out in an hour of weakness asserted her right in the face of altar and grave to sit by his bier the seductions of alftruda who won hereward away from his homeallegiance and who made the last of the english do suit and service to the greatest of the normans are shown in too abrupt and fragmentary a fashion it would seem as if mr kingsley had spent his power on two of his principal figures and yet the monks and servitors and knights and gay companions who fill the background of the picture are all in their places and fill the background with life and reality a little revision would make this one of the best novels of its kind in being the scenes are thrown off and finished with a vigour which is proportioned to their importance there are few things better in modern romancewriting than the sack of peterborough after the pictures of vicious modern life and social disease with which we have been of late satiated in fiction this study of a ruder world yet it may be not a worse one comes with a great relish we have seen nothing from mr kingsleys hand which gives us so high an idea of his powers as a literary artist,history
the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to

run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always the same with you people he cannot pay something   he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you   alas no monseigneur  but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass well  monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass again well she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition is that a morsel of stone or wood with my husband name may  be placed over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will  be quickly forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the  same malady i shall be laid undw some other heap of poor grass i monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much  want monseigneur monseigneur j the valet had put ber away from the door the carriage had broken n into a bruk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left fg far behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly  diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau i  distinctly present to the taney of the writer must have 11 g ly  been that scene of the taking of the bastille which is here is j made present to the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to the story of doctor manette as to the history of france here again is a little picture of saint antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sance to wretched bread  yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarges wineshop parted with its  last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door  at last it is come my dear f eh well returned madame  almost how admirable is the picture of the rise of power io the doctor when the day comes that makes the great horror of his life a means of blessing to his child by giving him influence as a bastille prisoner over the storm that threatens shipwreck of her dearest hopes he relapses when a second wave against which all bis skill is powerless breaks over her head aud the knot is at last solved by sydney cartou the exquisite poetry of the touches which detail to us j the manner of his sacrifice with the honour and trust  of an innocent girl to strengthen him in his last moment is worthy to be the close of a tale nobly sustained to the latest word a few touches here and there may be in excess  we are hardly content for example that it should occur to miss pros at a critical moment to compare madame defarge s eyes to bed winches  but these faults natural to au active fancy are very few and very slight in the work now before us lt is written throughout with an energy that never wanders from its aim a strength that uses with the

the ms in a red box lane 6s tue mystery of the ms of this story has been so much exploited that we need not refer to it further here save to pay that the book itself comes rather as an anticlimax for though it is a pleasant and reasonably interesting book it is no better than dozens of volumes which have appeared during say the past three years the author has a faculty for narrative sufficient invention and enough knowledge of his period to carry the thing through  in a word he is a good mechanic but there is no characterisation in the story the hero is the very type of the conventional hero and the three villains are very types of the conventional villain the hero sails triumphantly through all dangers to happiness and the lady and the villains come by their deserts there are a good many minor characters but they come in merely as accessories indeed the experienced reader can tell at once just why they make their appearance but all this is not to say that the book is not goed of its kind the setting is careful and accurate and the conflict between the folks of axholme and the dutch engineer vermuijden who had charles the firsts authority to drain and embank the isle is vigorously described the manner of the book smacks rather of wardour street purely modern phrasing and almost slang clash unpleasantly with an artificial archaism but here again the author merely sins with most of those secondclass writers of romance with whom at present he must be classed yet the story has promise and a kind of ease and briskness which experience may turn to good account and at least the book is wholesome and manly and cleanblooded  the ms in a red box lane the author of this romance has had the good fortune to hit upon a period in history which has not been hackneyed by general use we remember no other novel in which the draining of the fens by dutchmen under charles i is the mainspring of the plot it is well known that this improvement roused the fierce hostility of the people of the fens and it is that hostility which the author employs in his stirring narrative thus the tale has this to the good that it has a natural colour particular to it and is in consequence of somewhat a different shape from the multitude of romances technically termed  historical unhappily the characterization has little to distinguish it from the ruck of such performances the hero frank vavasour is the usual brave and reckless young fellow in love with a fair maiden as is habitual with such tales the hero is so headstrong as to run into every danger that a man with a grain of common sense would have avoided as is also usual he tells his own tale very modestly of course and sings the praises of his ladylove not so modestlyas is natural and the two chief villains are exactly what we looked forthe one dutch and the other an english nobleman they are blackened to a hair and could not be whitewashed by the most ingenious perverter of history but of a truth they glory in their shame and are calculated to fill unsophisticated minds with the most passionate feelings of revenge for the colours are all primitive and the drawing is with crayons not that that matters in this style of book it is sufficient that there should be plenty of incident which there is and that the narrative should amble briskly which it does the writing too is of quite a spirited order so that there is little wanting to make a good book of adventure rather above the average and possibly the earnest of better work by its anonymous author  the ms in a red box 6s lane mysterious and ingenious rumours and advertisements had raised our expectations to such a height that  the nis in a red box must hai e been a very e xt raord r in a ry book inceed if it had come ip to them it is not a lery extraordinary book but it is distinctly good and if it had not been so overshadowed by its antenatal reputation it would have seemed even better it is a brisk capable romance of the accepted latterday patterr laid in the lincolinsiire fen country in the reign of charles i  it has the usual fearless but somewhat slowwitted hero who plunges into a fresh peril every time lie goes out of doors is f r e q u e n t i y wounded and once left for eead but always comes through triumphantly the usual faitlful retainer the usual lovely much persecuted heroine the usual dashing villain whose schemes to kidnap her invariably fail at the right moment the usual crop of glaring coincidences and the usual happy end but some of the minor characters are excel lently drawn the details of

quite at home in the local aspects of somerset and devonshire and he is thoroughly acquainted with the rustic life of england as it was in those days when there was no communication between one town and another except by packhorses for goods and stout nags for men and when the people from another parish were foreigners instead of neighbours when highwaymen flourished and the gibbets which studded exmoor told that some of them fell victims to their profession the story takes us completely into a bygone world the rustic life of england as it was led at plover barrow farm is set forth in a way to make one wish we might have paid a visit to that worthy and stalwart yeoman john ridd the owner of the place and the hero of the story plover barrow farm seems to have been a rustic paradise it is pervaded by a sense of homest labour and wholesome tranquillity with such a wealth of plenty and comfort and warmth that the reader is made to feel as if he had been carried far away from london and was breathing the pure air of exmoor and luxuriating in the good country fare so well and vividly described plover barrow farm had belonged to th same family of yeomen ever since the days of king alfred  and john ridd himself is quite  genuine hero whose fame for great stature and bodily strength and skill as a wrestler still survives in local tradition the story is narrated in the first person by john ridd himself it begins with him as a boy at school fetched home suddenly on account of the death of his father who had been set upon by a party of the doones and killed as he was returning home from market with some of his neighbours now the doones were a family of outlaws and freebooters who had established themselves in a valley on the borders of bagworthy forest supporting themselves by rapine and robbery and were the terror of the country for many miles round these doones are strictly historical personages and the account given of them in the novel is curious the chief or patriarch of the tribe sir endsor doone was originally a gentleman of estate standing well in the county but who owing to some sleight of law or star chamber proceeding had been dispossessed  and then he and his sons and nephews and all belonging to him declared themselves the enemies of law and established this stronghold where they built a village stealing the materials and entrenched themselves a in a camp they were strong handsome godless men who had neither mercy nor scruples they carried off not only horses sheep cattle and money but the wives and daughters of the inhabitants when it seemed good to them they were never brought to justice they were an established power the peaceable people feared them and in time almost got used to them the long immunity enjoyed by the doones throws a curious light on the condition of the western counties at that period these doones play a considerable part in the narrative they are like the giants in the old nursery tales and john ridd is like one of the champions who used to arise for the deliverance of the country people whoever has read the old nursery story of tom hickathrift will see a generic resemblance in the fortunes and character of though two heroes john ridd is a hero of what we flatteringly call the genuine english type he is brave modest and upright scorning lies and mean actions gifted with enormous bodily strength which stands him in good stead in his various adventures and dangers we cannot give an outline of the plot for it is a series of incidents how john ridd ventures into the very heart of the doones valley when a mere boy and how he there finds a beautiful fairy princess of eight years old named lorna doone granddaughter as she believes herself of the grand old sir endsor dooneand how he devotes himself to her and how the love he bears her grows np with him and continues the good influence of his lifehow he goes to see her at intervals though every visit is at the risk of hislife if discoveredand how at last after the death of sir endsor he rescues lorna from the cruel keeping of carver doone bis successor who is starving her to death unless she will consent to marry himhow he manages their escape in the midst of the great frost of 16s0 and how she is kept warm and happy at the farm and how the doones make a night attack to recover her and to burn the bidda out of house and homeand how they are repulsed though john ridd will not shoot his enemy carver doone because guns seem treacherous weaponsnl how lorna turns out to be no doone at all but a great scotoh heiress lady loma dugal who is fetched up to london made a ward in chancery and put under the guardianship of her uncle the earl and how she remains always faithful to the good john who has a narrow escape of being hanged by col kilke after the battle of sedgemoor in which he had taken no part except to help a wounded man upon the field and how that was the means of his being sent to london where he not only meets lorna but has an adventure with burglars which makes him much talked ofand the king bestows upon him the honour of knighthood and a coatofarmsall this and much more is narrated in a quiet and veracious style with unconscious touches of character and the introduction of persons who are not only historical but lifelike some of the incidents are narrated with ct powerbu oh as the outrage by the nea which at last aroused the longsuffering country people to avenge themselves and to destroy the whole race of doones and the final attack and destruction of their stronghold the deathwrestle

opened hopefully mr blackmore tells us in his preface that in  lorna doone  incidents characters time and scenery are alike romantic he has in fact amplified and embodied some of the wild legends of exmoor in a narrative of coherent interest and personages distinct and lifelike john ridd who tells the story thus introduces himselfi am nothing more than a plain unlettered man not read in foreign

gleam of romance which crossed their homely horizonwith a real danger anl dread to heighten itwas caught from the lancetops and wvatchfires of their terrible neighbours the doones whose chief sir ensor mad with rage at family feuds in whichl he believed himself wronged did some violent deed which caused hin to be outlawed in the year i640 and finding every hand raised against him took refuge with a few adherents in a lonely exmoor gorge defended by a natural fortress of rock here as the tribe increased a rude village was built whose lhalfsavage inhabitants lived mainly by rapine this is the first sight john ricld had of them when crossing the doonetrack on his way home from school at tivertonwe rode very carefully down one side and through the soft grass at the bottom and all the wvhile we listened as if the air was a speakingtrumpet then gladly ve breasted our nags to the rise and were coming to the comb of it when i heard the sound of horses feet knocking up through splashy ground    just as the foremost horseman passed scarce twenty yards below us a puff of wind came up the glen and the fog rolled offbeforc it suddenly a strong red light cast by the clouds weight downwards spread like fingers over the moorland opened the alleys of darkness and hung on the steel of the riders   most of allthe flinginrg fire leapt into the rocky mouth of the glen below me where the horsemen passed in silence scarcely deigning to look round heavy men and large of stature reckless howv they bore their guns or how they sat their horses with leathern jerkins and long boots and iron plates on breast and head plunder heaped behind their saddles and flagons slung in front of theim  more than thirty went along like clouds pon red sunset some had carcases of sheep swinging with

shouted to them leaping on a rock and raving out of all possession two of them turned round and one set his carbine at me but the other said it was but a pixie and bade him keep his powder the lad had more cause than he knew for his frenzied wrath his father had been killed in an encounter with the robber horde a few days before wonderful painting of life at the farm followswith the simple thrifty loving mother the two sisters one fair sweet and rather silly the other sharp clever and bitter even in babyhood and the ignorant hardy zealous servantsstudied with the minuteness of a dutch interior

sweet a sound as came from between her bright red lips while there she kneltand gazed at me  neither had i ever seen anything so beautiful as the large dark eyes intent upon me fill of pity and wonder and then my nature being slow and perhaps for that matter heavy i wandered with my hazy eyes down the black shower of her hair as to my jaded gaze it seemed  and where it fell on the turf among it like an early star was the first primrose of the season and since that day i think of her through all the rough storms of my life when i see an early primrose years spent in outdoor toils and

an old drake from a watery grave for the comfort of pretty annie lets john endanger life and limb by a wild huntsman ride on his beautiful mischievous arabian and reveals himself as their faraway cousin tom faggus the great highwayman a jovial soul if ever there has been one not making bones of little things nor caring to seek evil there was about him such a love of genuine human nature that if a traveller said a good thing lie would give him back his purse again a marvellous portrait is this hero with his fun and daring his social talents and lawless living his paying toll for the travellers whose pockets he has emptied that they might not be put to inconvenienceand his abundant almsgiving from the gold to which he has helped himself at the lovestory which springs from the rescue of the rash drake we must only hint a more reputable but less agreeable relative is mr reuben huckaback the richest trader in dulverton a very strange old man short in his manner though long of

she died upon the verge of womanhood cut off in the very springtiae of her beauty and of her intelligence how great a loss the world sustained is seen now in the succession of posthumous works which her sorrowing friends have published which she with the modesty of genius supposed to be unfit for the public eye because they did not come up to her own ideal standard of excellence but the welcome that has been given to all of them and their undoubted merit shows us what she would have been had it been the will of providence that her genius should ripen to maturity god however thought otherwise and took her pure and holy spirit to himself the daysof bruce is another of her fictions a composition of her early youth but full of beauty her purpose in this story is to depict and develop the character of woman in vamious situations of trial in isabella of buchan we have a picture of a heart wounded in its affections but trustful and hopeful in its misery in isoline the selfinflicted unhappiness of a too confident and selfreliant nature and in agnes  the overwhelming of a mind too much akin to heaven in purity and innocence to battle with the sorrows that beset her path of life guacie aguilan knew the female heart better than any writer of our day and in every fiction from her pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of the motives and feelings of womans nature the days of bruce possesses also the attractions of an extremely interesting story that absorbs the attention and never suffers it to flaz till the last page is closed and then the reader will lay down the volume with regret mrs nehtox crotand better known perhaps as caiiilla toomxin states in her preface to lydia a womans book that her design was to depict certain phases of life  from a womans point of view and that in doing so she has sought chiefly the approval and sympathy of her own sex the story like all of mrs croslands productions has a wholesome moral not preached however but shown a lesson which the reader learns without the appearance of learning conclusions which he draws for himself with the pleasurable consciousness of selfinstruction this is a groat art in fiction known only to the better class of writers and were we find it we mav be sure that we have passed out of the region of commonplace and are in the company of an author not of a mere scribbler and pretender to authorship mrs cnoslands lydia is an exquisite portrait of a true woman the story is thoroughly rational and probable but never dull she possesses indeed the rare faculty of creating an interest in ordinary things and persons by the charm of her descriptions in short she is an artist  her books are works of art carefully designed conscientiously composed corrected with care having an aim and a plan and therefore not only delighting readers of all classes but commending themselves to the intellectual who desire in a book something more than a mere pastime who rquire it to be like a good picture a menti study and such is lydia miss foudriviers little volume our seto parish is a collection of bketches and short tales which we should have commended very highly had they not been preceded by miss mrinet s our lillage upon the exact model of which they are moulded so little indeed does the author aim at originality that she is content to take the very title with a differenceanother yet the same for it will be obvious at once that our new parish is a very palpable plagiarism from our village the words are changed indeed but the meaning is the same and no less stiiking is the likeness in the sketches that are strung together under this title we regret this for really there is a good deal of merit in the writing the authoress has a lively fancy considerable power of description and invention enough to have produced something original let her make the attempt and we have no doubt it will then be our duty as it will be our pleasure to give her a more cordial welcome than in honesty to our readers we can now proffer,history
new novelsl the drum8 of war by henry de vere stacpoole john murray we must regard mr stacpoole at this stage as in the forefront of romantic writers it is not certain that in sheer romance he does not beat his rivals his power over an atmosphere is as remarkable as his facility he wanders from epoch to epoch and from country to country his new novel is concerned with the france of the third empire we have an incidental glimpse very vivid of the disastrous policy which culminated in the fatuous and frenzied cries of a berlin but for the most part the story is divorced from history it has at its base a tradition that the persons of an ancient tragedy are reproduced in hero and heroine and fulfil their allotted fate  heroine  is perhaps the wrong word to use as it is probable that the author as well as his readers would claim as heroine another woman than margaret von lichtenberg candidly the career of this other does not convince us altogether she is too sentimentalized it was unnecessary for mr stacpoole to drag her through the mire why did he  this wantonness is the only blot on an enthralling romance,history

solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of

whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,history

new novels i castle omeragh by f frankfurt moore i constable  co the author will lose none of his popularity by this wellconceived and carefully elaborated contribution to historical romance the main action lies on the west coast of ireland and the time between the massacre of drogheda perpetrated by the troops of cromwell and his check by general oneill before clonmel the hero walter fawcett younger son of the owner of castle omeragh tells the story in his own person though his language is edited into modern english he introduces himself as three  parts a quaker but towards the end of the narrative he avers  despite the admiration which i still have for the precepts of george fox this is my firm belief war is a horror but it had its origin in heaven and it retains some of those elements which pertain to the place of its birth here we seem to see the influence on our author of recent events and perhaps the present fashion is responsible for his depicting the hero as a successful gazer into a crystal pyramid he introduces sufficient lovemakiug of a daintyand sober kind and plenty of adventure with a seasoning of the horrors of war according to mr frankfurt moore the devilmaycare boastful thriftless jovial sporting irish squire of the regency period dated back to 1649 at least as exemplified by the heroines father obrian whose ways and talk furnish much of the humour wbich lightens the narrative,history
the scarlet pimpernel bv baroness orl zv 6s greening the scarlet pimpernel in book form has many of the qualities which have won for it an unusual dramatic success as interpreted ba mtiss neilson and mr terry the book takes its name from the flowerbadge of the daring leader of a small band of english gentlemen who sought honour and adventure in attempting to secure the safe escape of aristocrats from paris during the revolution the story has much of the thrill of a tale of two cities the adventures of the scarlet pimpernel  are varied and exciting and the secret of the heros identity is maintained with remarkable skill and with excellent effect on the stage or off the scarlet pimpernel is a story that enchains the attention  the elusive pimpernel by baroness i orezy hutchixison  co tis is obviously a sequel or at least a pendant to a previous tale by the author for we pick up the narrative at a revival of the feud between two men the one the famous scarlet pimpernel sir percy whose hobby is to save distinguished french prisoners from the guillotine and the other an agent of the french jacobins our only complaint throughout this adventurous and ingenious medley is that the scarlet pimpernels deadly foes are such simpletons they have him in their hands only to let him escape by a dodge which would not have deceived a child however if the reader can accept such improbabilities he will find the story entertaining,history
  ulrick the heady or the chieftains last rally by standish ogrady downey co mr ogrady is master of every detail of elizabethan ireland  he knows not only her history but her manners and her fashions more intimately than most of us know those of our own day he has too an eye for the picturesque and a resolution to accept ugly truths which are rarely met together and when he likes he can be as convincing as our greatest writers of stories of adventure but unfortunately he does not always like he holds that the function of a historical novel should be to illustrate history and popularise truth   while we share the opinion of his hero ulrick that a good bard  telleth his story as if from the report of eyewitnesses and earwitnesses without too many resounding words which though often pleasing to the ear are like mist in the air when one desires to see clearly the desire  we think the unseasonable desire  to impart knowledge constrains mr ogrady constantly to break the thread of his story in order to illustrate history or some minor detail of mannersan intrusion of powder into our jam which we resent the more because our authors jam has an excellent flavour we could see and believe his story if he would let us his worst offence is at the beginning of part il where under the misleading subtitle of love and war he inserts four chapters of irish history pure and simple commencing seven years before the time of our story but probably ingenious youth seeing the names of mount joy the queen sir henry bagenal sir r wingfield and though earl of ormond will skip lightly over the sayings and doings of these too familiar personages until they make their exit and ulrick holds the stage once more we ourselves plead guilty to this baseness thus we found mr ogradys little sins more irritating than his crime why for instance need he break the thread of his always interesting story at a most exciting point to tell us that my calf was a term of endearment in ireland as it was in greece when euripides wrote his tragedies or that  egerton and ulrick wore their hats in the withdrawing room and at supper it was a custom of the time the hat was a headdress not a mere protection from the weather  earwitnesses and eyewitnesses would have made no such reflections and the vivid picture of elizabethan munster which mr ogrady conjures up in this heroic tale is far too good to be marred by such insistence on petty details the feuds of the hostile tribes the life of the castles the oppression of the nobles the degradation of the churls the barbarous and heathen ways of life and thought and the hordes of birds and beasts of pre going as vanguard to the armies are vividly depicted  but we regret that the upper rooms of irish fortresses were approached by  dark and stony corkscrews that irish chieftains did not carve their meat but  industriously dissected it and that a little keg should contain  the agency necessary for washing down long walters breakfast such slipshod phrasesand they are manyare only more remarkable because of the general excellence of mr ogradys work we know no other modern book which gives such a graphic picture of elizabethan munster,history

agnes tie mansfehlt an historical tale literate ll e notices of new works by thomas colley irattan author of  jacqueline of holland  the heiress of bruges  higlivvays and byways c c c no period in the history of the world can he more interesting or more instructive to the protestant and even to all elasses of christians than that which embraced the first outbreak of the reformation and the subsequent events when mens minds were still in the ferment of indecision mr grattan has very judiciously availed himself of the striking incidents peculiar to this state of things in the welltold tale before us there was a time which we hope the christian world will never again see when prelates wielded the secular sword not abstractedly but actually and the same hands that performed mass and the same mouth that gave the benediction of peace clove the scull of his fbemau with the battleaxe and cheered on with the war cry his fellow men to murder ghehhard de truchses the hero of this historical novel was the catholic archbishop and sovereign of cologne and its dependencies he was a man of no common penetration and strength of mind lie is introduced to the reader as wavering in his faith and love turns him at length to agnes de mansfeldt and marriage  from that moment the train of his misfortunes commences his subjects revolt another archbishop is elected and after efforts almost superhuman and the witnessing of the defection of friends and the baseness of human nature he and his wife are driven forth upon the world as abject wanderers and after much hiding and much misery at length find refuge in the reformed court of the i vince of orange during all these strange vicissitudes the character of the heroine comes out brightly she with her husband meet many romantic adventures among others not the least striking may be recordedher rencontre with the earl of essex her subsequent visit to his palace on the thames and the interruption of their interview by the jealous and despotic queen elizabeth our author speaks not lovingly of the  good queen bess but we much suspect quite as she deserves the reader will find these volumes very exciting though he will perhaps regret that excepting in the two principal characters he will not find that unity towards a single catastrophe that tends to make the construction of a novel so complete there is the continued interference of a celebrated and very original villain a count scotus that makes the plot in many parts quite a intricate as that of a spanish play  this keeps up a very absorbing interest and the reader as well as the author must feel much obliged to the wily count lt is a great pity that he is such an unmitigated rascal we hardly think him natural as there is no one redeeming point about himhe is a monster perfect in his villany this novel will be read with pleasure by all those who understand and love good writing and who are prone to take a philosophical view of mens actions and passions as tiley work out the great revolutions of history mr grattan has certainly in this production increased his reputation and done no small service to those who read only for amusement by thus pleasantly forcing upon them a lesson in history at once so excellent and so extensive  agnes de mansfeldt a historical tale by thomas colley grattan o vols saunders fir otley tue main characters and events of this romance mr grattan assures us are strictly historical and may be found in the chronicles of the days when elizabeth reigned in lugland philip in spain and ghebhard truchses was elector and archbishop of cologne with this priest and prince the interest of the tale abides his times were those of change both in politics and religion he inclined to the lutheran side but menaced by fierce neighbours of the romish church it is likely that he would have held fast his allegiance to the old faith but for a visit to his court by the heroine of the narrative the lady was young witty and beautiful she was learned too and her taste in love inclined rather to ripe sixandthirty than to raw nineteen this was fortunate for thc elector his years corresponded with the taste of agnes but there were serious obstacles in the way his station forbade wedlock  she was a heretic too and his subjects were catholics and a perseverance in honourable love threatened the loss of both mitre and crown in this dilemma he was offered the help of au italian count scotus who like his relative martins galeotti was a greedy spendthrift as well as necromancer inspired by the desire of reward from the elector for furthering his love and the hope of sharing in the plunder of cologne scotus pushed on the marriage by visions from thc other world as well os by intrigues in this and succeeded in all but one plot was not sufficient for the genius of the italian he bereaved a princess of saxe coburg of her husbands regard and of her state jewels and would have drowned her in the rhine had he not been thrown into the river himself moreover he plundered and at thu same time imprisoned ernest of liege the electors chief enemy and all but lost count ulrick his life in a love expeditionthe least happily conceived of any incident in the story in short the necromancer is the prime mover of all cologne is stormed by the catholics the elector loses bishopric and principality and deserted by all the world save his own fortitude oud his young and faithful wife ends his days obscurely and happilydomestic love triumphing as it ought to do and seldom does over pride and ambition such is the outline of though story of the characters the most remarkable is count scotus  he is properly the hero the times favoured his pretensions yet we must ascribe something to simplicityfor he had the address to impose himself on priest and prince on maid and matronas a necromancer of the true michael scott breed who had lived several centuries and remembered the looks and words of dante and petrarch he is thus enabled to juggle princes out of their kingdoms princesses out of their jewels and their reputation soldiers out of their lives and though in the middle of the third volume we fairly saxv his last sobs come bubbling up in air from the bottom of the rhine yet wc find him riding in state at the close of the work through some of the alarmed cities of the continent the scene in which he begins to intimate his powers and pretensions is one of the best in thc work 44  in sooth count you do xvith infinite power raise up the images of buried things a xvizards skill could scarce do more said the elector as a short pause occurred after one of the strangers spoken sketches only broken by murmurs of applause from all parts of the table  and my old master of rhetoric the venerable joachim montonihoxv you bring him again before me  lie is now a most aged man  v not so old neither replied scotus   44  not old exclaimed the elector 4 why when 1 sit in his class at padua he numbered at least three score and ten  and it is nowhow many eighteen aye nineteen years since then  is not that au aged man  4 comparativelyyesansxxerod scotus carelessly but xvith a look of so strange a meaning as made all near him stare first at him and then at each other but the italians look xvas unexplained and not commented on at the moment your highness might perchance like to see the professors handwriting when he xvas a younger mau than even xvhen you listened to his lectures  miiil scotus draining from his doublet a lnott antiquelooking parchmentcoxercd book of small iliineiiions fastened xvith brazen clasps of curious xvorkmauship   i should be glad of any memento of a man i loved so xxiii replied the elector and particularly of characters traced by his own hand the letter you ivcro the hearer of being written by that of his secretary this seems a rare volume  of manuscript its shrivelled leaves have the true stains of antiquity  it is as old met li inks as joachim mmitinis self 4 if your highness were to examine it a little you might believe it to be older  ah here is the professors signature indeed and the date 1527 more than fifty years back this seems to be a curious collection of autographs remarked thu elector turning over the leaves 44 yes i love to gather these contributions from memorable men 44 iather their contributions said tiuchses 4 lather them  why here is raphaels here dantes  hore ariostos name  if gathered it must have hoon in the grave 44 it is easier to outlive ones friends than to give new life to the dead  said scotus xvith a solemnity of tone so strongly contrasted xvith his prexious animation that the whole company felt a thrill of awe in unison with the alniot supernatural meaning implied in the expression 44outlive ones friendsand what arc xve to infer from that count  iiiid though elector smiling as he observed the half awestruck looks of his guestsbut he could not see his own   whatever may seem most pleasing to your highness replied the italian with au air ol resignation and modesty that seemed mixed with sorrow  the great raphael died full half a century ago you ure not quite so old methinks count  said nuenar with a sarcastic smile   i am glad you find me worthy of a thought sir said the italian  and the immortal dante closed his liie in thirteen hundred and thirtyone two centuries and a half ago observed one of the abbots who sat on scotuss right hand iii thirteen hundred and twentyone reverend father rejoined the latter  and was born in twelve hundred aud sixtyfive ho who fol lowed the hearse of the man and has rocked though cradle ofthe child may he accurate as to dates of him he loved and honoured thc elector was a firm believer in destiny imagined that slight accidents foreboded great misfortune interpreted all against himself and lived a life of mental disquietude a man duped by himself is sure to become the dupe of others and scotus was the person sent by destiny to wile him on to ruin the young wife of the elector evidently a favourite with the author tried in vain to call his high qualities into action as the storm thickened the angry parley between the elector and his revolted subjects is a scene of great force  we scarcely like so well the one between the necromancer scotus and the princess of coburg when he is ubout to toss her at midnight into the rhine we were a little startled on the score of historic consistency when the banished elector and his lady found the earl of essex with dee the english necromancer groping after his own destiny at midnight among the ruins of theronenne but not so much perhaps as was essex himself when on a visit which agnes paid him in london he saw she was the very picture of mary queen of scots and perceived queen elizabeth at his door to conceal the countess was but the work of a moment for closets are always ready in romances but to conceal her from elizabeth was another matter she had a line tact in seeing through mysteriesthe scene in which she opens the chamber door and mistakes agnes for the spirit of mary of scotland is well drawn it is not new perhaps but it is natural and pleasing to see two nobleborn and nobleminded creatures like the elector and his lady descend gracefully and with little murmuring from their high station and in solitude reap the harvest of affection and philosophy  on no better materials could genius employ itself and though mr grattan has not raised a structure wholly to our mind we cannot refuse him the praise of having created what is both commanding and picturesque,history

sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think him soour grandchildren will do neither our utmost stretch of indulgence is to excuse the sailor because he was only a sailor sailing away as a boy and all his life from the charmed circle of insular prejudice learning life by living and foreign peoples in their own homes instead of in british parlours lecturerooms and missionary meetings admiral hobart like many another sailor of vigorous understanding unsophisticated conscience and limited culture failed to appreciate the timehonoured prejudice which should have forbidden him to respect in the infidel those very virtues dignity sobriety fortitude domesticity truth generosity and love of justicewhich he had been taught to revere as the peculiar appanage of his own countrymen in his eyes the swindling greek was no better than the corrupt pasha the savage baehi bazouk no worse than the cutthroat bulgarian and none of them half so bad as the atrocitymonger he may be at times superficial and inaccurate but that his main views will ultimately prevail and that the simple adnals of his life now before us will come to be read with keener and more enlightened interest is a prognostication rather than a prophecy e

senorita montenar by archer p crouch 6 smd eitr gallantry requires that the senoritas name should head the book perhaps but it is a novel with a hero who is a good deal more important and interesting true the young lady acts very correctly and very courageously according to tradition connives at a prisoners escape takes many risks and proves herself worthy to be the wife of a sailor in war time but it strikes us mr crouch only put in the loveinterest because he felt he had to what really concerns him are the adventures of an english naval officer driven by hottemper and illluck to enter the merchant service under a spanishchilian master and then for similar reasons forced to engage in the war of chilian independence his cruising in search of prizes is full of incident and hairbreadth escapes but we feel he has nine lives at least and when he is captured by the villain don guido imprisoned in a foul dungeon with a death sentence hanging over his head we know he will come out of the dark days all right his escape and his hiding in the hollow tree will certainly appeal to all rightminded boys for whose tastes mr crouch is well fitted to cater,history
  the thrall of leif the lucky a story of viking hays by ottilie a liljencrantz nicago mcclurg  co ir is no less difficult to write convincing fiction about the viking age than about the homeric the writer who endeavours artificially to reproduce the spirit of the norwegian and icelandic sagas with their unsought simplicity and childlike faith is almost doomed to failure and it is equally out of place to introduce the subtleties and complications of modern life in  the thrall of leif the lucky the author has produced a story which without being in any way specially brilliant or powerful can yet be read with pleasure as an honest and unaffected piece of work she has studied her sources with evident devotion and writes with warm but not aggressive appreciation of her subject the tale deals with the fortunes of a highborn english youth who is taken captive by danish pirates brought to norway and sold into the service of leif one of the guardsmen of olaf trygvasson  the author wisely refrains from bringing that great king himself upon though scene it is perhaps superfluous to remark that fighting and adventure of one kind or another are liberally provided throughout the book and one is not greatly surprised to find that an expedition to vineland occupies a prominent place in it,history

  the thrall of leif the lucky a story of viking hays by ottilie a liljencrantz nicago mcclurg  co ir is no less difficult to write convincing fiction about the viking age than about the homeric the writer who endeavours artificially to reproduce the spirit of the norwegian and icelandic sagas with their unsought simplicity and childlike faith is almost doomed to failure and it is equally out of place to introduce the subtleties and complications of modern life in  the thrall of leif the lucky the author has produced a story which without being in any way specially brilliant or powerful can yet be read with pleasure as an honest and unaffected piece of work she has studied her sources with evident devotion and writes with warm but not aggressive appreciation of her subject the tale deals with the fortunes of a highborn english youth who is taken captive by danish pirates brought to norway and sold into the service of leif one of the guardsmen of olaf trygvasson  the author wisely refrains from bringing that great king himself upon though scene it is perhaps superfluous to remark that fighting and adventure of one kind or another are liberally provided throughout the book and one is not greatly surprised to find that an expedition to vineland occupies a prominent place in it,history
richard carvel american fiction by winston churchill macmillan  of the inevitable comparison between this and thackerays celebrated volumes nothing shall be said in this place this romance of the old maryland days though not a masterpiece is good enough to stand on its own merits there is a vigorous swing in the way of telling the story and not a little life and movement it is certainly too long and there is a plethora rather than a poverty of event and episode on the whole however  richard carvel is a more than fairly entertaining specimen of the average historical novel the time is about a hundred and fifty years ago and the localities maryland and london the interest centres on the colonial period of the united states history and the scenes in and about london introduce wellknown figures and their resorts the story is in the nature of a lively and spirited romance conceived with an eye to broad effects carried out with some idea of big masses and scenic light and shadow there is besides a good deal of play of character richard carvels grandfather the old maryland gentleman with his blind faith in a king who is only one in name is a superior study in types of the past richard who tells his own story does it in interesting fashion and is himself more of a human being as well as hero than many of those forced to play the part in recent volumes his courage and sense of honour are simple and unpretentious yet conspicuous the heroine in spite of suggestions as of an innocent beatrix esmond is not without traits of character quite her own the number of stirring and eventful scenes here and in america serve to make the book seem shorter than it really is the author has daringly but not unconvincingly introduced some wellknown faces fox horace walpole and particularly paul jones are a good deal in evidence the fortunes of the last are ingeniously interwoven i with the thread of narrative and the international troubles of those days if one now and then wearies of the ramifications of a story running to something over five hundred pages one gets in return a good deal in the shape of amusing or instructive information about a time and circumstances less written up  than born others the illustrations are poor and therefore superfluous in one we have a landsmans notion of a boom blocks and mainsail and some crude ideas about perspective generally  richard carvel by winston churchill 6s rhe mac miliae company there is good ground for honest congratulation of the young author of  richard carvel it is an historical romance on a difficult model which yet never shames its model either in matter or in style there is a much greater gravity and dignity in it than in most stories of its kind written today but this is not attained at the cost of liveliness we have read it with growing interest for the narratives sake and pleasure for th9 promise it displays 1 esmond  has determined its manner and design and that this fact has not taken the life out of the story is much to mr churchills credit richard carvel is a young american who goes through the great revolutionary struggle of a loyalist family he cherishes republican principles himself and his pictures of the times are thereforevaried and impartial his adventures include many in england and an intimate acquaintance with men so diverse ascharles james fox and paul jones the historical portraits are capital a great deal of work has been spent on them and not of an elementary kind either romantic readers may think he has emphasised the snobbishness and the vanity of  le capitaine paul but his estimate of that great sailor s lower qualities is no harsher than they will find in laughton while his genius and his service to the american navy never lack appreciation the glimpses of fox reflect no little of the charm of that fascinating personage for the rest  richard carvel  is a spirited tale of wandering and adventure with a wholesome lovestory to keep it fresh and sweet and provide for it a happy end,history
grisly grisell or the laidly lady of whit burn  a tale of the wars of the roses by charlotte m yonge 2 vols macmillan co there are no symptoms of weakness or fallingoff in the last product of miss yonges indefatigable pen which takes the form of an uncommonly graceful and welltold tale of the wars of the roses the historical background is touched in lightly but with skill and the excellent moral of the story is all the more effective from the absence of any aggressive desire to be edifying on the part of the author miss young may be said to have taken for her text the homely old adage handsome is that handsome does for in the person of her sorely tried heroine she has sought to show how humility and devotion may in the long run outweigh the loss of good looks in the eyes of that fickle monster man and her story is so simple and touching that few readers will grudge the latewon happiness which falls to the lot of the heroine whose patience is as monumental as that of her famous namesake,history
the cavaliers of virginia or the recluse of jamestown an llisto rica ilomance 3 vols a very good work and deserving notice the plot is wellconceived and embraces many stirring and grand incidents the time of action is laid precisely at that period when the accession of the second charles of england gave the cavalier party in that country and her colonies the great supremacy which in general they used so insolently the story briefly runs thus a brian oreilly with a little boy on his back that he had just saved with himself from shipwreck finds protection for both in the mansion of a mr fairfax a strange name for a cavalier and this boy proves to bc the hero of the story he is brought up with virginia the heroine and daughter of the benefactor when nathaniel liacoti the least heroic of names comes to mans estate he finds himself in love with his fostersister macon though he wishes to go the whole hog with the lady is no beggar private and very ample remittances having been from time to time forwarded to mr fairfax for the expenses of his education and finally for the purchase for him of one of the best plantations in the province now in the vicinity of these good folks there resides one of a character not altogether so unexceptionable but much more romantic  one vast gigantic regicide recluse colonel whalley thc actual husband of mrs fairfax the mother of virginia and as he him elf supposes the father of nat bacon this whalley was long sup posed to have been shot as he deserved and it was only till after this was supposed to be ascertained that mrs fairfax remarried now thc then governor of virginia was a peppery hotheaded addledbrained ultracavalier named sir william berkeley with a reprobate nephew called beverley his heir and successor virginia is an heiress and it is the arrogant governors pleasure that she shall marry his heir bacon puts in his caveat this is the state of affairs when the roundheads rise and endeavour to blow up the governor in his statehouse bacon saves the town from destruction and proves that he has other qualities besides that of  sighing at his mistress s elbow9 to be entitled a hero he gets dreadfully wounded for his pains but thinks himself well rewarded as it is the means of gaining the plighted faith of the lady we cannot even name all the intervening and attendant incidents arising from this position of affairs the reader must suppose a duel a metre with the indians and the introduction of an indian princess with a whampum belt and mocassins all very effective but which has but little to do with the course of the story except in so far as it introduces an opportunity of getting the hero to the stake and his body systematically planted all over with pine splinters preparatory to a roast but the historical and political events are thc most extraordinary for some reasons utterly unreasonable to everybody but the prejudiced old governor he allows the indian tribes to confederate and make head unmolested on the frontiers of his province at length they openly rise and ravage the country with all the ingenious ferocity of the indian the day before wyanokee formerly the servant of virginia now the head of the tribe had saved her bacon from roasting by using the red womans privilege of making him her husband and the day after these espousals without consummation we find the bridegroom in spite of himself proclaimed the general of the army of the colonists to resist the indian invasion and avenge its cruelties we think that here the fiction and the fact are improbably blended though the act of the colonists was necessary to the safety of the state indeed to its very existence the old governor stigmatised it as a rebellion calls in all the regular troops from the outposts on the extreme points of his government intending to fall upon the delivering army in the rear whilst the indian is in the front well out he marches from the capital with this commendable intention when the citizens whom he had left behind thinking this a queer way to save the country march out in the shape of another army to do battle on the governor so there are four armies going to fight each other in a line in the meantime bacon is too active isle annihilates the indian army in his front before the governor has time to attack him in the rear the old man then falls back upon the army at his tail not to right with it but to make all manner of treacherous concessions among which is that of granting regular commissions to general bacon and his officers once again in his capital he attempts to tyrannise as usual but the liberal party is too strong for him and he removes with the ships and the troops that are faithful to him to the town of acomac in the meantime bacon having impolitically left his army to reach the capital the sooner is taken in his passage by one of sir williams cruisers brought to acomac tried by a courtmartial as a traitor and sentenced to be hung of course the reader will suppose that every now and then virginia the heroine makes her appearance just when it is the most heartrending and distressingat this hanging business for example however the hero gets a days grace to prepare himself for death and next morning is found to have escaped from the cellar in which he was confined the governor again returns to jamestown and through treachery again finds himself master of his capital bacon rejoins his army they march upon the town a memorable fight ensues the loyalists are beaten and the town consumed to ashes vir ginia who always had accompanied the governor now falls into the handsarms we should have saidof the hero and they get married and all that we have not recorded some of the most striking scenes because we would not too much forestall the interest with the reader we conclude this notice by stating that the characters are well supported to the end and that the author has considerable powers of description the plot is all through exceedingly well managed and the denouement comes off admirably the faults of the volumes are a little proneness to exaggeration and a dialogue generally too pompous ana elaborate there is but one attempt at the humorous and it is completely successful that of the irish adherent we may promise all who should through our recommendation read this work that they will find we give it upon good and substantial

i i tyhitefriars or the days of charles the isecond a novel in 3 vols london 1844 colburn this is another romance of great pretension and small performance our readers will doubtless be tempted by puff paragraphs in newspapers scattered among the general news of the time and coming as if from the applauding pei a of editors to apply to their librarian for it but let them beware these paragraphs are but decoys written in the publishers office paid for at advertisement price and false from the beginning to the end  whitefriars  is a very stupid fiction the author wants most of the qualifications of the novelist his descriptions are vague showing an absence of definite conceptions of things in his own mind his characters arc commonplace and nothing more than embodiments of generalities without any of those individualities which distinguish the men and women of real life the plot is the best part of it but taking it for all in all we recommend the librarykeeper not to throw away his money in ordering and the reader not to vex himself in psalawing and pishing over it  whitefiiars or the days of charles the second thc obligations of novel writers and novel readers to that merry monarch  who never said a silly thing and never did a wisc one are almost illimitable like an inheritance increasing in value or a mine under process of working as posterity travels on thc more it is drawn upon the more do riches increase and multiply and in truth those eventful days seem the true era of fiction and kngland the rightful scene of its enactment thc strange and jarring clements of society meeting in sudden shocks remind us most of thc battle charges ow some wellfought field of contest on the one hand stands thc russetcoated steeplehatted lockshorn puritanstem remorseless condemnatory of all but self and sect on the other the gay lovemaking songtrolling curled and scented cavalierstiff only with gold and embroidery and easy enough in morals and conscience hypocrisy borrowing thc garb of thc one and sensuality licensing itself under thc attire of thc other arc to be traced out in all their various ramifications and gradations but never surely did they put on so bold a frontage of enormity as when charles led the wassail in his dissolute court and titus oats made perjury as common as household words thc characters of this date arc indeed marked and emphatic not softened polished and assimilated like society in more modern days but distinct angular full of peculiarities both of thc individual and the class the sobered tone of a more settled state like the frost which hinds every tiling in its chains was then utterly broken up and thc ocean roar of brawl and anarchy rang through the land no wonder then that these are times in which fiction loves to hold its fairy reign thc author of  whitofriars deserves our attention with many faults he has yet many merits and we would infinitely rather deal with these inequalities than glide over the tedium of sleepy mediocrity among these merits are an animated style good powers of dialogue a nev crtiring plot abundance of action and great diversity of character all these arc sterling things in the way ol desert and we desire to give them their full weight but still wc must look to the opposite scale now thc object of a novelist like that of the artist is to paint portraits and these portraits must either be of individuals or of our great mother nature when an author chooses to take those whose actions history has recorded for thc subjects of his delineation lie paints a person of which the world may fairly judge of the likeness the man remains with us in the memory of his actions and wc can accurately compare thc one with the other and judge whether or not they bc just counterparts the other alternative making nature the sitter leaves us with an equal facility to judge of the resemblance her laws being universal and subject to neither change nor fluctuation since uley were first immutably oidaincd and our question is whether the author of  whitcfriars has or has not infringed upon the universal legislation r lust calling to thc bar of judgement those who arc

private revenge of neverending subterfuges of neversatiatctl crime of all this thies colonel blood static convicted anti is it therefore consistent with his bravo character to timi a line of lingering tenderness written in his blotted heart for the child of the man whom be had murdered  wc think not thc injurer always hates thc presence of the mjured and the child inheriting thc wrongs of his parent must needs seem poison to the sight of him from w hose sins he suffers the one sole animal virtue for which colonel blood could ever deserve admiration is his courage in all else he was a monster hut the character of lady aunierlc alas that we should be obliged to admit that it has ever had prototypes  but when wc remember the unnatural mother of the unhappy poet savage we arc obliged to confess that such feminine fiends have existed anti wc grieve to admit that our author can plead even a solitary instance of example for her delineation hut we make a graver objection to the portraiture of diaries it seems to us as if the novelists of thc present day entirely hist sight of the truth that wc have no more right to judge uncharitably of thc dead than of the living we believe that wc have less since thc departed can no more lift up a voice in selfjustification anti it matters nothing to the principle whether an individual has passetl from this worlds arena a day or a century to tread lightly tiver the graves of the deatl is a touching adjuration kven the sable race of thc muchdespised negroes might teach us a lesson in this linc in thc work  antigua anti the antiguans to which we have endeavoured to tit justice in a preceding page wc find that sullying anti polluting the grave of the tlead is the greatest injury anti grief that can bc inflicted on the living lathering a lesson from this natural instinct we must say that our author has dealt somewhat too hardly with king charles the second though dissolute he was not sanguinary though profligate he was not malignant too easy tt be unforgiving and too fond of pleasure to play the ruthless tyrant we defend not charless sins but we certainly think that they were numerous enough without adding to their total anti if ever excuse could be found for levity of conscience anti of conduct it might be allowed in his case the sorrows of his youth might well make charles hate the republicans who had caused them anti had stolen away his crown while thc fearful murder of his father in inducing detestation of the puritanism which had caused it need create little wonder if in the reaction all religion fell into disrepute hut the bias of our authors minti explains this severity on the restored monarch the puritan faction he lias painted as would best please themselves the royalist party bc has depictured as would best please their enemies passing over the host of really interesting individuals who covered thc scene wc pause for a little space upon thc hero wc think that in him thc interest is somewhat deficient rndoubtcdly a hero is always entitled to preeminence but the young aumcrle has ii mu isle lacks the nerve of moral courage his flight with oates a man whom he despised

will commend themselves to all lovers ofnature  my southern friends mr kirke proposes to narrate in this volume nothing but what he has seen and though his incidents are startling enough there is nothing improbable about them still we must receive themn with caution that excellent woman mrs c m kirkland he writes said to the author shortly after the fall of fort sumter if you cannot shoulder a musket you can blow a bugle the book before us is the bugle and the blast against slavery blown from it is very lond indeed in mr fairfaxs  elopement which we noticed in the londox revivw may 16 an attempt and not an unsuccessful one was made to show how little practical sympathy for the degro exists in the northern states but though the writer vehemently pressed his argument he was unable to conceal that while the condition of the slave in the southern states under a benevolent proprietor is far better than that of the free negro in the north nothing can be more wretched than his case if he has the misfortune to belong to a savage mrs fanny kembles residence in georgia which we reviewed in our number of the 6th of june gave us a picture of slavelife on an estate which had the reputation of being humanely managed making allowance for the colouring which a woman possessed of strong feelings and considerable eloquence could not help ging to such a subject the facts which she recounted materially affected our estimate of the creature comforts enjoyed by the slave even under a kind uster the book before us written with strong abolitionist ypathies leads us to believe that humane as mrs kembles husband may have been his estate did not resent a fair specimen of slavelife in the south when mitigate by the benevolence of the owner mr kirkes desrptio xy sother fremda by bdaund kirao autor of asu th phos low son x of the slaves on mr prestons estate shows us the northeast pbis ultra of negro happiness in the south and from the picture he has drawn of their comforts and the paternal care of their owner we are induced to believe that he has blown his bugle more in sorrow than in anaer unfortunatelyr this term  paternal care  has a double imieanimg that a man shall have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing her husbands attachment to his offspring by phyllis by parting with her trinkets kirke and preston find phyllis while she is yet in the hands of the slavetrader at a village store in north carolinah er figure was slight and graceful and her face very beautiful she bad long black glossy hair straight regular features a rich olive complexion and large lustrous eyes which as she sat opposite the open door were fixed on the thick gloomy wood with an earnest almost agonised gaze as if she were reading in its tangled depths the dark uncertain future that lay before her never shall i forget the expression of her face never have i seen its look of keen intense agony and its full perfect utter despair one of the children was a little girl of eight years with a sweet hopeful expression a clear rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons plantation near newbern here we find that prestons humanity to his slaves is ruining him and that with a hundred and fifty darkies he is going to the dogs while a certain colonel dawsey with only seventyfive works his estate at a profit preston explains how the colonel is so successfuldawsey has seventyfive slaves forty childbearing women twenty men and fifteen children under five years the sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their children and the waking rest necessary to working people he never whips them on a weekday because it wastes working time but makes sunasy a general flogging season he has two women where he has one man and each woman is expected to bear a child every second year if she doesnt she is sold they are made to work in the field till the labour pains are on them and arm allowed only two weeks res ar confinement three of them have born children in the woods this season he keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children and as soon as each child is five years oldthe ag at which it can be legay sold awra from its motherit is disposed of to the trades in addition three of these women are his mixtresse and they must bave children as fast as the others he serves their children like the rat that is rears them to the age of five and then sells them as he would so many hogs mr kirke does not confine himself to details which tell against slavery his deseption of ms preston shows how the highest womanly qualities can flourish side by side with the most hateful of social institutions she was a perfect womana faithful mistress a loving wife a devoted mother an every want of her husband rully inscting breon overseeing every detail of her oueod ueting out th red allowance of the negroes viting daily the cabins of the ad the infi d with hw own d ds u om s ing or the king m iineor whm an medin fed bedbug the lowly bd o the dyin and poxi to h better oa h e a e g apiy a bjeia to is about her she wre ostly s lm h b i or jewels in her hair but she was arrayed in garments all rich and beautiful with human love suich women mr kirke writes are seen nowhere more often than in the south her husband too was solicitous for the religious wellbeing of his slaves his connexion with phyllis had terminated with his conversion to nobler thoughts and he taught his slaves their catechism and regularly attended the ministrations of the negro preacher old joe his grandfathers son by one of the old reprobates slaves side by side with the negros pitiable condition there is a vein of irresistible grotesqueness running through his life in nothing nmore remarkable than in his religious exercises joe had a rival in his clerical vocation a negro named jack whose gift was prayer and whose predilection was whisky the predilection was necessary to the full development of the rift mr kirke went to hear him open the sunday service gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment he drawled out my bredrin less us raise our hearts ter de lord the whiuce congregation then kneeled and jack closing his eyes clenching his hands together and throwing his bead back until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building  lifted up his voice and prayed  after the fashion of very many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob us dat hab come inter de worse sence hab stumbled an broke de law case he did how noah though he was a white man and had a white wife begat a black son and how that black son was a great sinner and how all his descendants have taken after him and been mighty big sinners ever since  then he described the sinner particularly the black sinners preeent and if half of what he said was tie every one of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed frank and selma to the family pew tittering laughing and flaunting their redandyellow kerchiefs the black people were enjoying themselves amazingly when  dar dey comes darm de happy pussons went round the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand before them  rosey was dressed in white with a neat fillet of pink and blue ribbon about her head and ally wore a black frockcoat with white vest and white cotton gloves one of the groomsmena rustic beau from a neighbouring plantationwore an immensely longtailed blue coat with brass buttons a flaming red waistcoat yellow woollen mittens and a neckerchief that looked like a secession flag hugging a lamppost both of these gentry had hats of stovepipe pattern very tall and with narrow bms and they wore them during the ceremony s  silence in de meetin  cried joe  the boisterous sea of black wool subsided to a dead calm those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all the responses with great propriety but some of the congregation seemed less familiar with the service when joe repeated the words if any man kin show cause why dese olks should not be lawfully jined togedder less him now speak or ele fbr eber hole his peace dinah turned to the audience and cried out yas jess less him come out wid it now rd like ter see de man dats got onyting agin it  no one appeared to have  onyting agin it and joe proceeded to read the wods i require and charge you if either of you how any impedment  in the midst of it a voice called oute dar it no pedimen bon joe i

be thy welded wife then dinah unable to contain her self longer joyfully exclaimed  ob course he will any youn fellerd be glad to hab htai the ceremony is then completed and is followed by a dance in which master joe prestons son1 makes himself conspicuous as roseys partner in one of the sets for his marvellous dancing but when the young mother is confined her child is white preston to his horror discovers that his son ignorant of the girls parentage is the father overwhelmed by this shock by his wifes cruelty and extravagance and by the hopeless state of his affairs hie dies and now mrs preston learns from phylliss slave husband that selma who has all along been supposed to be prestons daughter of pure white breed is the oflfpring of his amour with phyllis the girl has received the highest education and has grown up into a wouman of surpassing loveliness mr kirke describes her appearance at the opera in boston her mother was almost white her father pure white of such parentage selma is not the only issue famed for extraordinary beauty and now comes the crowning interest of the story selina is bought by her brother joe but frankan adopted son of mr kirkes and the illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread it,history

the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the time watched by three brahmin priests in disguise at the taking of seringapatam john hernoastle an english officer is met by one of his relations at the treasury of the palace and under rather suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about the place he starts for the neighbouring town a few miles off and deposits the moonstone with a banker there by the time the birthday iarrives rachel has refused another cousin godfrey ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them sergeant cuff an eminent detective is brought down friud london but rachel refuses to give him any information and strange to say she completely onto her old lover and will hold no communication with him sergeant cuffs suspicions point to rachel herself he thinks that she has used the diamond for the purpose of raising motey to pat her debts and thae she has been aided by rosanna spearman one of the servants a deformed girl who had been brought up as a thief and whom lady verinder had received from a reformatory xnny circumstances point to rosainna as the guilty person the newlypainted door leading to rachels sittingroom has bean smeared and the smear must have been made by thi thiin the night clothing of all the servante is found eorredt but rosanna is known to have purchased sode cloth at the vtiaseand to have been engaged in her own room making aomethi in addition the detective discover that she bhs bought a tin box and chain and sinks them i the shivering sads on th coast and not far from the house this box the egeda it assured contains the uightgou of the guilty penrsn bdsasspearman however commits suicide and the detectivle is at length dismissed by lady verinder leaving the mysterj unexplained in time however all is cleared up a oommunicative assistant to a country doctor had whilst his master wine delirious taken down his ravings and got at the fact that one of the gentlemen at the birthday dinnerpartywe will not disclose the authors secret by saying whowas drugged with opium the assistant is of opinion and finds his view fortified by a passage from carpenters physiology that the dadmul was stolen under the inflreace of the drug and that it is not impossible that another dose way result in the sleeper i  all that he did on the prewis occasion the eperz i tried in the presence of witnesses and a sham diaeod is tva in the same way that the real one had been but be d affording some proof not very strong that the suspeted indivml was not a thief the meas adopted are rsultflss as the sleoini drops the piece of glass upon the floor and sinks off to shop rachels solicitor andl friend 3fr bruff however has good reason for suspecting that the diamond has been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old steward had less to say about robinson crusoe miss clacks narrative is intended to convey the idea of a meddlesome fanatic but it is merely a broad burlesque of the character,history

alroy jumped off the horse and would have led it to the fountain but the animal would not advance it stood dreadfully shivering with a glassy eye and then it bowed its head and with a groan fell down and died nhiht brings restnight brings solace rest to the weary solace to the sad and to the desperate night brings despair the moon has sunk to early rest but a thousand stars are in the sky the mighty mountains rise severe in the clear and silent air in the forest all is still the tired wind no longer roams but has lightly dropped on its leafy couch and sleeps like man silent all hut the

suddenly and silently it steals and stops and smells llrave banqueting i ween tonight for all that goodly company  jackal and fox and marten cat haste ye now ere mornings break shall call the vulture to his feast and rob ye of your prey the jackal lapped the coursers blood and moaned with exquisite delight and in a moment a faint bark was heard in the distance and the jackal peeled the flesh from one of the ribs and again hurst into a shriek ol mournful ecstasy hark their quick tramp  first six and then three galloping with ungodly glee and a marten cat came rushing down from the wonda but the jackals fierce in their number drove ber away and there she stood without the circle panting beautiful and battled with her white teeth and glossy skin and sparkling eyes of rabid rage suddenly as one of the halfgorged jackals retired from thc main corpse j dragging along a stray member by some still palpitating nerves the marten cat made a  spring at lier enemy carried oil his prey and rushed into thc woods her wild scream of j triumph woke a lion from his lair his mighty  form black as coony moved on a distant emi nence  his tail flowed like a serpent he j roared and the jackals trembled and inline tiiately ceased from their banquet turning their  heads in the direction of their sovereigns voice  he advancedhe stalked towards them they j retired  he bent his head examined the carj cass with condescending curiosity and instantly l quitted it with roy disdain the jackals  again collected around their garbage the lion j advanced to the fountain to drink he beheld la man his mane

feeling of desire and surprise isle awoke and from a swoon but the dreamless trance had refreshed the exhausted energies of the desolate wanderer in an instant he collected his senses remembered all that had past and comprehended his present situation he returned the lion a glance as imperious and lierce and scrutinising as his own for a moment their flashing orbs vied in regal rivalry hut at length the spirit of the mere animal yielded to the genius of the man the lion cowed slunk away stalked with haughty timidity through the rocks and then sprang into the forest in the foregoing we have the faults and the better qualities of the work pretty fairly balancedgood ideas bad epithets true pictures want of taste and poetical images and something of philosophical reflection marred by

towards night he re turned home but the gates of the city were shut and he went down into thc valley of jehosaphat and entered the tomb of absalom  and slept and be dreamed a dream  and next morning he came into the city smiling and  the maiden met him and she said k is that  thou art thou a laugher and lie answered k behold yesterday being disconsolate i went out of the city into thc desert and

on the knees of the gods by a f p harcourt 2 vols 12s bentley this is a story of indians and angloindians and too much of it is concerned with the tame gaieties of station life a highcaste baronet loves the beautiful hazel the child of a very inferior official a poor depressed creature very conscious of his position the baronets mind is as lofty as his rank and he would have ignored differences but we can see how lamentable it would have all been and the writer could hardly have sanctioned such a mesalliance so a confession is wrung from the depressed lowgrade official that she is no child of his at all but a cousin of the baronets whereupon we breathe freely there is a livelier portion which tells of a horrible native plot to carry off the beautiful hazel and a scoundrelly halfcaste who did no good in real life is of service to the reader in thickening the plot and dyeing it a darker bue  on the knees of the gods by a f p harcourt 2 vols bentley  son nothing can be much duller than the dull novel of the angloindian type  on the knees of the gods answers but too well to this description there is nothing in it to recommend it to any reader but the totally undiscriminating one who grows or should grow daily rarer the story is not well written it lacks interest as do the characters one man acts in a way no one of average common sense a quality supposed to be included in his composition could possibly act but it is not necessary to indicate blots on what is less a picture than a mere blur,history
the good sword belgarde by a c curtis henry frowde hodder and stoughton 5s the taste for affairs of war either mediaeval or modern is without doubt inherent in most boys the age may be long past when the embryo soldier struts round the nursery with a weapon constructed from two pieces of crossed stick threatening all who venture within his range with summary decapitation but the propelling forces still work in his brain finding their quieter outlet in hours of reading about swordplay and deeds of derringdo such boys it seems to us have been most liberally catered for by authors and publishers this season the title alone of the story before us is enough to make any highspirited youngsters mouth water and his pleasurable anticipation would be fully justified for the history of the  good sword belgarde how it was captured in hard fight how courageously and effectively it was wielded how to the very end it carried a fair ladys favour fied at its hilt is all most excitingly told mr curtis takes his readers back to the days of king john when the french were not quite as friendly towards this island as they are at present dover castle is under siege and the account of events within those wellknown ramparts during the hostilities is very realistically and cleverly done stones and arrows hurtle and swish through the air greek fire is concocted by a wise old warrior who is quite a character in his way and twice its use defeats the tactics of the enemy there are escapes sorties treacheries chances of the most thrilling description we are glad to notice that the author wisely decides to avoid entirely any attempt to reproduce the old english form of speech such a task is far too lightly undertaken by many who write of ancient times and it is not to be successfully achieved by the introduction of a  gadzooks  zounds or  ifaith thourt a sorry knave every two or three paragraphs the talk of the characters is perfectly rational and not too obviously twentiethcentury so that no serious incongruity is noticeable we commend this plan of writing careful and restraining modern english to others who seek to rehabilitate the past in the guise of romances the illustrations in colour are good of their kind and the recipient of this volume may well consider that the author has allowed him full measure of heroic things if he begin it anywhere near bedtime there will be trouble in the camp when that fateful hour strikesand what more significant could we say,history
the day of wrath by maurus jokai trans lated from the hungarian by r nisbet bain jarrold  sons  jo kai has written many weird stories but never wrote one more weird than the present it is a tale of family feuds and a great part of the plot centres in the house of a public hangman some of the characters are interesting for instance general vertessy the strict disciplinarian but humane soldier under feminine government the best parts of the book however are those in which the author displays his descriptive powers his landscapes are often wonderfully true to nature his account of the burning of the hangmans house is a vivid if somewhat sensational narrative the 44 slovak  conspiracy seems to us considerably overdrawn the hungarians should be the last to make fun of national movements even if they do occasionally have a ludicrous side the belligerent schoolmaster who is supposed to call himself numa pompilius of all names  is sn impossible person mr bain tells us that jdkai wrote this novel on the collapse of the great hungarian insurrection in 1849 he was ill at ease and tired of the abortive efforts which those around him had made a german novelist at the time would probably have described the democratic efforts of kossuth when he solemnly deposed the habsburg dynasty in the same way as jo kai does the scheme of the poor slovak schoolmaster but national struggles are not necessarily ridiculous as the hungarian insurrection showed some however of the satire here is well bestowed as when it lashes the insolence and apathy of the magyar aristocracy which were also the themes of some of the most telling verses of petofi,history
  the siege of lady be solute by harris dickson harper  brothers mk dicksons reinforcement of the historic romance which has recently had such a run in america is ineffective work though care and conviction have evidently gone to its composition it lacks vitality or any distinction of style but contains some popular qualities for here is due compliment of duels  to the death hot pursuits and hairbreadth escapes the heroine moreover steels her heart in the approved fashion for heroines of this order of fiction to prolong up to the very last page her lovers punishment for an early and promptly repeated lapse of loyalty the scene is laid mainly in france in the latter and less lustrous days of the fourteenth louis and a few historical figures make a rather feeble appearance madame de maintenon is utilized allowably enough in her traditional character of cold and scheming devote as an evil genius of the plot the author is happier among the mississippi forests whither the demands of the action transplant most of the dramatis persona half way through the tale than he is in a french chateau the weakest point of this book is its poor suggestion of atmosphere the historical novelist is seldom altogether successful in safely steering his dialogue between the scylla of stiltedness and the charybdis of anachronistic colloquialism such expressions however as  slipping around mad sc angry what are you coming at quit work right here c in france of the eighteenth century certainly tend to destroy what there is of illusion,history

tlte fortunes of nigel literary notices by the author of waverley sec  knifegrinder story  lord bless you i have none to tell sir poet ry of the a ntijacobin we have copied the motto with the title of this new production of the most fertile imagination ofthe day because it will spare a world of criticism as a tale the fortunes of nigel is a mere abortion and the author is so conscious of it that he has constructed an intro ductiou of no mean length to prepare us for the fact and to excuse itan introduction by the way which wa should have liked full as well if it had exhibited less ofthe equivocal slang of blackwood magazine we hare no objection to a little deportment en cavalier from an individual who cfttsctyqs of merit and the art of pleasing despises the cent ari the oimmonplaces

the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political emergencies before his accession to the throne of england and the sole business of the story is to relate nis fortunes tn a journey to london to induce honest king james to repay it here we roust

accidental but it is an accident from which our northern brethren are so genet all preserved we have hitherto concluded that its avoid ance might be safely left to instinct the story opens iu the very best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it is accounted for while physically accurate is certainly imaginatively disgusting contrary however to all anticipation abe does not prove to be the heroine and the lady who is so is after all only a diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public will be extremely

the little brown brother by stanley portal hyatt constable os let it be said at once that mr hyatt has written a remarkable book and one that places him in the very front rank of living writers of fiction  the little brown brother  is the achievement of which  marcus hay was the promise and those who have read the latter book will appreciate the distinction the story it tells is of american maladministration in the philippines and though english readers cannot be expected to take a fanatical interest in the united states equivalent of  our brother boer  controversy yet the authors style and characterisation lift the book out of its locale and make it one to enjoy and to remember derek north an englishman of good family finds himself in the island of samar which according to the american politicians is in a state of quite unearthly peacefulness norths adventures prove otherwise rebellion is seething and although the commissioner with the conscience that resembles figures in that it can prove anything attempts to persuade the public at home that everything is all right american subjects are being murdered and american fraud corruption and bribery are having a splendid time at the cost of much blood and tears it is amongst these persons and doings that mr hyatt places his principal characters and clare westley her father major flint lieutenant rayne commissioner furber and others are depicted with that skill which as the academy pointed out at the time was a strong feature of the authors work clare westley is a very good specimen of the girl who falls in love at second or third sight but never at first and major flint is a type we thought exclusively british until mr hyatt persuaded us that democracy in the american army has not reached the limit that destroys discipline unless the public in the states are tired of the philippine question  the little brown brother  should create a sensation in america there are many serious statements that attack in the most direct manner the honour of the american colonial service and as it is the easiest thing in the world to label the proportion of truth in a modern work of fiction it behoves the american politician to see at once that mr hyatt is either disproved or muzzledor perhaps the politician might reform  however that is outside the scope of the critic and in england mr hyatts book must be judged purely as a work of fiction that he loses nothing by this test is a tribute to his skill  the little brown brother is distinguished by its strong clear english clever phrasing and astonishing lack of the superfluous it is a story of adventure battle murder and sudden death the author ringing the changes of scene with a dexterity that compels the reader to follow him breathless any englishman who felt sore at the strictures passed by americans on the conduct of the south african war need only read  the little brown brother  to regain his sense of superiority it exposes the fraud of american political life with a thoroughness that leaves no hope for anything but confession and the vagaries of a country where th 3 liberty of the subject is always at the mercy of the freedom of the mob find a critic in mr hyatt who we feel is most merciless when most truthful  the little brown brother by stanley portal hyatt constable  co intense prejudice against  colour underlies the sarcastic title of mr hyatts romance the scene is laid in the philippines after the capture of aguinaldo and while the americans were pursuing a policy of conciliation which recognised the universal brotherhood of mankind the hero is a familiar character in fiction a nobleminded englishman who as the result of scrupulous unselfishness is under a cloud to the admiration of every white man in the book he deliberately and without any formality shoots through the head an important native official who has abominably insulted the white heroine the action mostly concerns the attempt of an inadequate force to quell a rising of pula janes or murderous christian fanatics the author is at his best in realising the sympathy which draws brave men together  he touches love with nobility and restraint but his irony is too fantastic to be convincing,history

a marriage under the terror by patricia  wentworth andrew melrose public attention has been attracted to this romance by the fact of its advertisement as a prize novel three ladies of repute as writers selected it independently and probably their choice was justified for a first story it is a skilful wellengineered piece of work and if it shows no signs of breaking away from the fictional traditions of the terror is at least brisk in narrative the invention is orthodox and the machinery is generally that hallowed by usage the french revolution has almost had its possibilities exhausted as a source of fiction of course a writer of individuality and original gifts would be able to infuse fresh life into the subject but patricia wentworth hardly answers to that description she makes it clear however that she has a turn for novelwriting and with cultivation her characterization will develope au this is to say that while a marriage under the terror  is agreeable it is rather a book of promise than performance the author keeps the reader on tenterhooks as to the fate of the hero and heroine until the very last pages  a marriage under the terror by patricia wentworth melrose 61 this is the novel which won mr melroses last prize of two hundred and fifty pounds it is a rather conventional story of the terror the heroine being an aristocratic girl and the hero a friend of dantons the author puts them in sufficient danger to satisfy an ordinary novelreaders appetite and rescues them from the guillotine in a grand love finale a marriage uxder the terror gives us no new sensations  a marriage under the terror by patricia vent worth 6s andrew melrose a pretty young aristocrat midlle aline de rochambeau i saved from the guillotine by the coolness of dangeau  colleague of danton dangeau declares they are betrothed and the marriage has to be consummated before the girl has time to realise her position the pair come iangerously near to the guillotine before the end of the tory but it would not be fair to the authoress to give lher plot away she has written a thoroughly exciting tale  the revolution the scenes in paris and in the country iurc graphically described and perhaps the highest praise  reviewer can give the novel is to confess that after the pcrusal of over a dozen stories of the kind he has read this one with unabated interest if it is a first novel it is full of promise miss wentworth has caught the temper of the romantic tale she has even learned the secret of working up to a powerful dramatic situation and then resuming the course of the narrative without dropping the attention of her readers the heroine is not a very vital creature miss wentworth might put more blood into her women in future however there is plenty of other peoples blood in this novel and the reader may open it with the assurance that he is in the hands of a very competent storyteller,history
simon dale two historical romances iii by anthony hope methuen qi nc  co shrewsbury by stanley j weyman longmans  co except he be a fool whose prudence is notoriously limited a novelist must require a good deal of skill and courage to embark on an historical novel for while complete success means that he may have produced some of the most entrancing fiction there is to be read as dumas did and sir walter scott a bad historical novel is associated with the dreariest experiences of the novelreader failure indeed is much easier than success for the disadvantages of introducing historical personages are obvious while it requires exceptional delicacy to seize the right amount of reality which may be allowed in a novel one of the charms of historical novels is the greater footing of intimacy on which they can put the reader with historical personages and the enhanced sense which they give him of their reality claverhouse and fouquet louis xi and louis xiv as real characters are more interesting and living even to the historical student from the pages of scott and dumas and by a kind of reactionary force they get an added interest in the novels from the fact that they undoubtedly existed but this balance must be retained the novelist must not forget that while his ideal i  presentment may add to the reality of real t persons though success of his ideal present i ment depends in a large measure on the j 1 vividness of his real persons in history it is quite possible indeed that a good novel may be written about obscure historical characters unearthed from old chronicles or brought out of the lumberroom of history but their interest is something quite apart from the historical 6ide novels about the early christians for exampleeven dumas wrote one and it was a failure i possess small interest as such because we know so little about them historically that all the information vouchsafed reads liko mere pedautry in such cases the history is a burden and a defect in the novel and the people who unearth obscure polish kings for their novels fall into the same pit it is an essential in a good historical novel that the real persons introduced should be already so familiar that any new detail about them may appear of importance a second essential in an historical novel is that the real characters introduced should be kept to a strictly subordinate position the reason of this is obvious  that as their actions are known to history if they perform one of their real actions in a novel there is no surprise or interest possible in the denoument of an event which is known whereas the possibility of their performing imaginary actions is limited by the knowledge of what they actually did dumas alone was strong enough to allow his characters to perform their real actions in his books but he always got over the difficulties by devising some stupendously ingenious explanation of his own for them as in the celebrated incident which explained how monk became reconciled to charles ii but unless one be a dumas it is better to let the real characters saunter on and off though stage in the way thackeray did with such masterly effect in  esmond imparting a sort of substantiality to the fictitious characters or to make historical events not the central incidents but important only for their influence on the lives of the imaginary heroes as scott did the difficulties which the historical novelist creates for himself are thus obvious as his historical characters must be fairly familiar his range of invention is limited for if he makes them unlike their reputation he ensures disappointment for example a novelist who made louis xiv seem undignified or charles ii a bigot might as well stick to his middleclass love story again if the big men of history have to play a more or less subordinate part great imagination is required to raise the hero to a fitting pitch of sublimity then on the other hand the triumph of the successful historical novel is unlimited the sense of proximity to the richelieus the louis xiv8 the claverhouses or the marlboroughs of history adds an intense thrill to the emotions the conviction that a common musketeer outwitted mazarin or that charles ls last words were whispered on the scaffold to a french adventurer or that mr addison is speaking in real life and not in the spectatar as he does to the common herd is among the most overmastering sensations in literature the added sense of reality which is given to a wellknown event by the immixture of the hero of a romance in it is also no mean part of the joy in a good historical novel anthony hope has very nearly obtained a complete triumph in his simon dale he has chosen an excellent period for the actionthe time of charles il known to us by mr pepys and comte de grammont an audacity in itself deserving of success  and the audacity is all the greater and all the more successful inasmuch as he obviously imitates dumass method in his narrative and actually brings in louis xiv himself as dumas did in le vicomte de bragelonne charles il is excellent he is witty goodhumoured and at the same time a king even when he allows himself to be mocked by rochester or buckingham rochester and buckingham the duke of monmouth and the duke of york all live in our writers pages and the more vividly for his narrative louis xiv himself is all that one is led to expect that the roi soleil should be save in one instancehis leap into the boat we are convinced that louis would never have so far forgotten his kingship as to do that especially as his passion for barbara quinton was evidently a mere whim yet even for this lapse the author wins immediate forgiveness by the splendid use he makes of it and the dignity with which louis carries off his amazingly impossible situation as for the hero he is a perfect hero of romancehe is brave witty adventurous and a good lover and he succeeds in the difficult task of narrating his own prowess without a suspicion of priggishness this is an achievement which dumas himself would hardly have been equal to especially when the hero has to suggest that a lady whom he had ceased to love was all the time half in love with him but this form of narrative is anthony hopes strongest point and one is apt to forget its difficulty in the ease with which he carries it off perhaps the least convincing part of the narrative is the heros calf love for nell gwyn it does not ring quite true but it serves as an excuse for a great deal of nell who is the most charming coquette imaginable for the rest the story is rapid and most excellently told the ingenuity of the beginning and the way in which the keynote of the story is struck almost in the first line are especially remarkable and hardly for an instant does the story flag as simon dale is fighting duels or talking to kings and princes on almost every page  hardly for an instant we said advisedly because here as we noticed in  phroso anthony hope apparently does not quite see where he ought to stop the part after barbara has been brought home seems if the comparison may be pardoned almost like flogging a tired horsenot that it had shown any signs of fatigue before but the final incident with carford and fontelles is too detached from the rest to fit in well and the book would certainly have come to an end with more sparkle if the lovers could have been finally united at though end of chap xx in fact the author seems to some extent to feel the awkwardness himself and his only lapse which is decidedly clumsy from the first person is in this part there are good things in the last six chapters but they are rather like a second slightly inferior course mr weyman is perhaps unfortunate in though fact that his book appears so closely in timo to anthony hopes brilliant novel shrewsbury is anything but brilliantit is somewhat pedantically written with one of those tiresome attempts to reproduce the style of the period and the central figure who is also as in simon dale the narrator is so contemptible a cur that he becomes positively dreary of course it is possible to be interested in a cad and a coward in fiction but

the fall qf nan soung a tale of the mogul conquest of chaina by a l lymburnsr in 3 vols london 1846 saunders and otley this is we believe the first attempt by an englishman to make china the scene of a romance the enterprise is sufficiently daring when the difficulties are considered and instead of censuring mr lvmbvtrnkr for not having succeeded better the wonder is that he should have done so well all experience proves that a novel to command the sympathy of the reader must be taken from the life it will not be enough to paint from books hence it is that all novels attempting to describe remote countries not known to the writer personally have proved comparative failures even when the scene is laid in remote times in his own country the novelist is not popular unless he sketches his characters from experi ence and with exquisite judgement contrives so to set them in the framework of his story amid the accessories of other man ners and scenes that there shall be no glaring incongruities a melodramatic pageant is the result of the ablest effortsa spectacle at which we gaze with wonder at its gorgeousness or in admiration of the invention and skill of the artist but which excites in us none of that emotion of sympathy that absorbing interest in the words and actions and fortunes of others which it is the proper province of the novel to produce if this be so with romances that relate to distant times in a country familiar to the writer how much more grave will be the difficulty of him who selects a country he has never seena people of whom he personally knows nothing manners and forms of society he has only read about and which differ altogether from those to which he is accustomed and that difficulty is increased tenfold when the attempt is made with china of which even books afford but scanty knowledge and that mainly relating to the objects that meet the eye of the stranger while of the true character of the people their idiosyncrasies their inner selves there is positive ignorance with so difficult nay so impossible a task as he had under taken it is no reflection upon mr lymburner to say that he has not been entirely successful but he has exhibited very great abilitya fertile fancy and a good judgement in grappling with those difficulties which make us lament that he had not directed them to a field in which they might have been employed with results that would have redounded more to his fame and proved more profitable in a mere worldly view lie has been extremely diligent in the collection of his materials the foundation of the plot is historical at a period so far back as the close of the thirteenth century when the dynasty of soung was overthrown by the tartar kublai khan aided by the treachery of the prime minister kyatsetao the hero is tkangia a mandarin whose cooperation the minister desires to win the heroine is lu seynah daughter of luseufu kyatsetaos rival out of these conflicting elements the necessary difficulties of the plot are evolved the tartars and their camp are introduced by means of the tartar minister who procures the heroine and her friend to be carried off and brought to his camp where they are introduecd to kublai khan and rescued in due time by the hero the style of mr lymburnier is vigorous his descriptions are graphic and his dialogues are not too prosy we should like to meet him upon english ground for we are inclined to think that there is promise in these volumes which with ex perience and diligence augur for him a high place among con temporary novelists whether the subject of this novel will be likely to attract the circulating libraries will better judge than we can but if that please the execution will recom mend it still more and it may be safely ordered,history
lewis rand by mary johnston con i stable  co an historical novel extending over 450 closely printed pages subjects the readers patience to an unduly severe test and we cannot say that the interest is always maintained but the charm of miss johnstons writing makes amends for much the scene is that oldworld virginia which has furnished a delightful background for some of her earlier books and the period is the first decade of the nineteenth century jefferson is effectively introduced and the wild empirebuilding schemes of aaron burr play a large part in the story but the author is as might be expected at her best in the tale of love and jealousy entwined with these wider issues and in many scenes especially towards the close we breathe the true atmosphere of chivalrous romance the ghost kings by h rider haggard cassell  co in this story mr rider haggard returns to the maimer of his earlier romances to such good purpose that despite its length and somewhat episodic character interest is kept up from beginning to end the central idea is apparently founded on a rumour that circulated among the zulus during the fifties concerning a beautiful white girl the daughter of a pioneer missionary who in dingaans day was believed by them to be possessed of supernatural powers and in fact to  hold the spirit  of an artam goddess of their nation out of this legend mr haggard has woven a long and stirring tale of adventure enveloped in the romantic atmosphere he knows so well how to create the reader wanders in a strange country among strange peoples and all manner of outlandish alarms and excursions following the heroine on her perilous way there is naturally a strong element of occultism emphasised by the gift of secondsight possessed by the girl who is of scottish blood the description of the treeworshippers and their dwellingplace is impressive while a happy ending pleasantly rounds off this entertaining book   i,history

  claudia and pudens  or the early christians in gloucester a tale of the first century by the rev samuel lysons ma hamilton adams  cothe author in his preface after asserting  that works of historical fiction have an attraction beyond that of almost any other kind of narrative an assertion to which we are not at all prepared to assent seeing that if he had declared that historical fiction requires more genius than any other fiction to make it readable he would have been nearer the factgoes on to declare that he is so fully aware of the danger especially to young people of substituting fiction for genuine history that he desires fully to impress his readers with the fact that it does not profess to be anything else but a fiction he might have saved himself the trouble of protestingthe very first sentence dispels all illusions did the romans or any other creatures out of jamess novels or tuppers philosophy ever expatiate in the following fashion    how glorious is this rising sun as seen from this beautiful expanse of down remarked a gallant young roman of about two or three and twenty years of age glittering in a full suit of splendid armour on a bright september morning to another officer of rather riper years than himself  see how splendidly my dear friend loslius the vista terminates on the one side the broad sea save where vectiswoody isle interposes its undulating surf ace and on the other that rising ground backed by the dark shadesand so forth for a page and a half without ever tiring or stopping to rest and then he goes on to hope that in  a little while by setting the soldiers a good example in my own person of the virtuous mode of life so highly extolled by that eminent philosopher zeno to whose tenets as you know i have been so long attached i may be able to recall them from those gross acts of drunkenness and profligacy to which they are so dreadfully addicted even the president of a young mens christian association would hardly speak in this strain the romans did not improve their leisure hours in conversing like model schoolboys who suspect the master to be within earshot mr lysons gives scrupulous notes to show that his facts are all true and his theories highly probable  but he either does not know or does not consider that life and human nature are elements more essential to the veracity of a narrative than the scrupulons array of bald facts unless the spirit of the time be caught a whole encyclopaedia of classical history geography and antiquities will not make an historical tale veracious the scholarship manifested in the story of  claudia and pudens is neither deep nor heavyonly such as a reasonably wellread clergyman might carry without the slightest inconvenience to himself or his friends the reader is a little startled to find st paul coming to gloucester on a visit to pudens and preaching there mr lysons even gives outlines of his sermons and mentions the very spot where he preachedbut all is stiff wooden and very dry no young imaginative readers are in any danger of being seduced into a dangerous attachment to works of fiction by reading  claudia and pudens compared with which lemprieres  dictionary is an engrossing work mr lysons seems to have worked up his old sermons and fancied he was writing a tale and that he was giving dangerous exciting intelligence in venturing to mention the fact that the emperor nero set fire to rome and laid the blame of it on the christians,history
  a little traitor to the south by cyrus i townsend brady macmillan co american novels according to the present fashion are not complete without a bit of history mr brady describes his little book very well as a wartime comedy with a tragic interlude this interlude contains the true story of a daring exploit in which seven southerners lost their lives on board a sort of submarine torpedo boat after succeeding in blowing up one of the enemys vessels the exploit is related with spirit and is very cleverly worked into the lovestory which furnishes the comedy the comedy at the end is perhaps a little overdone but mr brady compresses the whole thing into a reasonable space and mixes grave and gay so as to furnish a highly agreeable story which is both exciting and amusing,history
fiction i the woodman a romance of the times of i i richard iii by g p ir james esq i author of a darnley c in 3 vols london newby 1849 mr james is inexhaustible and he is as facile in composition as he is fertile in invention another historical romance is to be added to the catalogue of his fictions that he continues to write and the public to read is proof of great capacities although he must needs draw somewhat more from memory and less from invention than at the beginning of his career of authorship if it be impossible that he can altogether avoid mannerism by which we mean the copying of himself yet it must be admitted that this his latest work shows no symptoms of exhausted fancy or overlaboured faculties the cause of this is the profound knowledge of the history of the middle ages its men manners and habits which has secured for his long series of historical novels an interest apart altogether from story or portrait to read a romance of his is to read the history of the times of which he treats only in a somewhat more lively and truthful and impressive form we have the result of his studies put into a pleasing picture which is readily remembered his personages may be real or ideal but when he does attempt to draw areal character itiselaborated withcare and history and memoir are consulted for traits which should as it were restore the dead for the benefit of the living perhaps as fine a theme for the novelist as any to be found in history is the character of rioad the third and the men and manners of his time the author is however subjected to the disadvantage of a comparison with the portraiture of shakspfer so great is the influence unconsciously exercised over us by the dramatist that our notions of the crookbacked tyrant are formed from the pa and not from history and any departure froml the main features of that representation is likely to be received with disapprobation by the reader as a violation not of truth only but of propriety mr james has boldly dared to introduce richard the third as not quite the fiend tradition and s1iak5pxri have made him and eonsequently more in accordance with such authentic memorials of him as have been reserved and which in the hands of modern historians have thrown a new light upon his character and career ilence a work which is more valuable more useful and likely to be of longer life than if it had been a mere romance to be read for its story and then thrown aside and forgotten mr james has produced a very perfect historical tableau in persons in costumes in scenery and accessories and we suspect that a much more accurate conception of the time of which he treats may be formed by a careful investigation of this romance than from any of our regular histories and even as a mere narrative it is one of his best and will profoundly interest those who care little for the profit to be derived from its perusal the plot is admirably constructed and ingeniously sustained and evolved the incidents are well imagined and the composition has more of the authors pictorial power than we have seen in any of his later productions lie has abbreviated his dialogues anl avoided that minuteness of inventory which was usually complained of by readers who were not possessed with a passion for antiquities we will not further describe the plot because the work will of course be found in every circulating library and be read by all who read novels and by many who do not confess to be readers of them it would mar much of their pleasure in the perusal to inform them here what is cointing so we content ourselves with a few extracts which will rather tempt to further acquaintance with the volumes than anticipate them the reader will probably be surprised to find richard described as a man having some tender feelings as in this masterly scene between himself and queen anne on receiving the news of the death of prince edward the instant she heard her husbands step she turned quickly round with a timid and inquiring glance but riclhard was in one of his milder moods the subject of his thought aid hers was one of common affection and lie advanced tenderly towards her and took her in his arms saying 1 have heard nothing ann but cast these fears from your mind i trust that this is nothing but one of those sicknvsses of childhood which come and pass away like spring showers the

the reds of the midi here is a historical novel such as we get only once in a very long time and in a translation so good as to balmost as much a rarity the author is a very distinguished provenalmy information i may as well confess is derived entirely from the prefacewho is at this moment capouliw that is official head of the fulibrige the society of provensal men of letters being second in succession to mistral he has written epics and lyrics and stories in prose and conspicuous among these wst is this tale of the march of the marseilles battalion to paris it is a very remarkable work it is literaturewhich not one such story in a thousand contrives to be but just because historical romance is fashionable now i should recommend it with a warning to those who read mr stanley weyman and his entertaining brothers and imitators in england it is not a budoir version of a rough chapter out of a rough and terrible time it is very real and very ungenteel the marseilles men did not fight in kid gloves nor save when they were shouting their songs or their stereotyped cries did they utter fine sentiments no one at all in this story is told gff to speak words of horror or deprecation or to adjust the balance so as to be quite fair all round it is made up of the recollections of a rude untaught peasant boy that marched with the battalion who had no theories but sang the marsellaise with greater faith than he had ever sung a litany no philosophy of any kind blurred what he actually saw his story is a peasants story and told to peasants there is a good deal to find fault with the incidents relating to the marquis dambrun and his family and surto and l jacarasse seem like a hallucination and that the wretches should stifler death by the very guillotine on which the child they had plotted to kill had innocently written her name is a straining after an artificial effect which is below the level of the rest but indeed the story does not much concern a reader though the characters do little pascalet margan and samat with his banner of the rights of man and his goodhumoured intolerance of anybody who would not applaud and look cheerful at their passage are not made of printers ink but of living flesh and blood and they make their presence felt it is the noisiest the most turbulent book plunge into it at almost any page and you know at once it is men of the midi you have to do with all that long weary trudge to paris with momentary intervals of depression their tongues and their throats are making a deafening din with the carmagnole or their own hymn the exuberance of their spirits produces every appearance of disorder they are chattering excitable children the vitality of a northerner would have given out long before in mere waste emotion but these had enough and to spare there was method in their madness they reached paris and tired of waiting for the word of attack from the finnicking timid townsfolk they gave the word themselves that lost louis xvi his crown pascalet is a type of them lie is in despair about his extreme youth and will convince the whole world by his tremendous exertions that he is as good a man as any he smears his maiden chin with blackberries insists on being harnessed to the cannon that he may enter vienne with honour and dragging with might and main is delighted when a girl cries out  just look at that young fellow goodness how he frightens me  he thunders out big oaths with ostentation and never a single grumble in the fighting in paris he is both frightened and plucky he dances with joy when he finds a joint of his finger shot away and plays the fool and the man and the child all at once wvhat military excitement means to an eager boy bred in obscurity will probably never be better described but as i have maid the paris scenes are not for squeamish reader who will be shocked to find no words of protest from the simple men who having walked hundreds and hundreds of hungry miles to do a thing had done it and had faith they were right though they found that the advent of liberty meant unloosing a good many devils from hell there is one striking passage in the book unconnected trhe

if i were king lunn ha 1 by justin huntly mccarthy heine mann gs mr mccarthy cannot in any real sense he said to have made a study of villon isle gives us certain historical facts and weaves about them a narrative wellconstructed melodramatic briskbut the book has no psychology now it is precisely the psychology of villon which should appeal to the artist as the psychology of ferdinand lassalle appeared to mr meredith when he wrote tl ie tragiccomedians there is really no reason why villon should be the hero of this story any sentimental rascal would have done just as well the quality of villons rascality and sentiment mr mccarthy does not succeed in conveying to us and katherine de vaucelles is no more than a figure moving prettily in stage gardens and the like places in a word if i were king is a story of pose of crude colour and of superficial sentiment indeed the sentiment throughout is cloying and sometimes almost nauseating to write  the cup of her heart seemed to run over with red tears is frankly to write nonsense of a particularly objectionable kind and there is much more of the same sort but we have no doubt that to many readers if i were king will make quite a strong appeal they will not however be readers who know villon at first hand to them the book will hardly count  if i were king by justin huntly j mccarthy hei nemann it would be superfluous to judge mr mccarthys novel from an historical standpoint since the characters whom he introduces are bent entirely to the authors own ends and are historical in little else than name his portrait of louis xi may be sufficiently striking to impress those readers whose knowledge of the cynical sovereign is not too intimate b ut it requires more than mr mccarthys undeniable brilliancy of narrative and picturesqueness of detail to enable us to recognise in the highsouled gentleman who as grand constable of france for one short week saves his country and wins the love of the lady katharine de vaudelles the sordid unscrupulous rogue whose rhymes alone have redeemed the memory of villon from the stigma of complete ruffianism mr mccarthy in his anxiety to present a vivid picture of the fircone tavern and its frequenters errs on the side of unnecessary coarseness but the story is certainly not wanting in melodramatic incident and for this reason is probably better suited to the stage  which it has already reachedthan to a form of literature demanding serious criticism of another kind,history
norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale barton cathcart is the son of a farmer who had from a small beginning worked his way to a position of independence and comparative wealth and from this father barton inherits the strong new england spirit of pride energy and force of character modified by a trait of melancholy derived from his mother his sister alicesilent shy and gentleis until the last vohune little better than a lay figure serving as a foil to the brilliancy of her friend rose wentworth the daughter i of the village doctor who himself plays no mean part in  the drama around these twobarton and roseare col  lected various persons who have little indeed to do with j the furtherance of the plot but not one of whom we would 1 be willing to have left out they are as the seasoning to i the dish barton goes to college without any disclosure of 1 his feelings for rose returning to the village only for occa  sional vacations meanwhile she grows up to womanhood i her character formed partly by her fatheran idealist j owning a sympathy with all things animate and inanimate and partly by her fathers housekeeper agate bisselin  every respect the counterpart of miss ophelia in  uncle 1 toms cabin the same conscientiousness the same in  dustry and the same untiring energy which marked that i indefatigable lady rose under this training became as  near perfection as is possible for mortals barton finally i returns from college to take the head of the norwood ara i demy but rn such a state of religious doubt as to prevent j his speaking to roseunwilling to unsettle her peace of mind by confessing his doubts and yet too honourable to conceal them in the meantime frank esel boses artistcousin and tom heywood a young southern gentleman bid fair to become rivals of barton and indeed in the case of frank bose takes the rather doubtful step of refusing him before he proposes heywood is one of the bestdrawn characters in the booka perfect contrast in all things to bartonfair aristocratic with a sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a gentleman wants a decorous faith a good plain sensible worship and then with a good conscience he turns to the enjoyment of life leaving to the deity andexcuse meto the yankees the management of unfathomable mysteries he makes little progress with rose but the arrows aimed for her find their mark in alice cathcart and she learns to love the bright young southerner an accident which happened while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely broken in upon by the news of the bombardment of fort sumter and we have an animated description of the rapidity with which the war summons was answered our friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a representation of american inner life we can thoroughly recommend this work of a man who is in his own person a remarkable representative of the public life of america,history
the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn novels c by henry kingsley 3 vols macmillan  cothere is a strange family likeness pervading the novels of the two messrs kingsleycharles and henry both affectthe former may claim the honour of having inventedwhat is called  muscular christianity in both the ideal of goodness is intimately associated with a sound digestion strong nerves high spirits and a large development of the animal powers not only the mens sana but the anima pura must be lodged  in corpore sano for real pietywe refer chiefly though not entirely to the sterner sexto be dyspeptic is difficult to be  larmoyant would be impossible the characteristics are utterly incongruous charity indeed forbids them to lay down as a broad principle that no true christian can be subject to neuralgia or afraid of bronchitis or weak on his pins or less than four feet ten inches in stature or too feeble to fight the blacksmith and too timid to shoot a robber but the best that can be said for suchjfrail brethren is that appearances are strongly against them according to the kingsley theory the perfect christian should be recognizable if exhumed a thousand years hence by some theological cuvier of the thirtieth century by the size of his skeleton and the magnificent expansion of his os frontis living in our own day this species may be known chiefly by their vigorous vitality their endurance of fatigue the inextinguishable laughter with which they greet every crisis of suffering or adversity and the stalwart strength1 which upon adequate provocation they can impart to the extensor muscles of the forearm written upon these principles the romances of either kingsley are full of excitement and interest their heroes are apt to display all manner of feats of personal prowess and of course find innumerable opportunities for such performances the author of  geoffrey hamlyna younger brother we believe of the rector of eldertonnow makes his first appearance as the writer of an independent work hitherto his productions have been limited to a few u spirited  articles in frasers magazine describing the sporting capabilities of australia his present work relates chiefly to the same country with which mr h kingsley is evidently well acquainted and concerning which he has much that is at once novel and interesting to tell the family theory indeed prospers amazingly by emigration to a new country in our old and hotpressed society at home we are forced to confess that  muscular christianity  is somewhat out of place it is not altogether true and might occasionally be found inconvenient a muscular christian of the kingsley type would sometimes under contingencies that must now and then occur in england find himself entangled in rather disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by heury kings ley 3 vols macmillan and co mr henry kingsley follows with much vigour his brothers lead and iu the school of muscular christianity which his brother has founded he may prove better claim upon the rank of a head master than that of founders kin the author of geoffrey hamlyn not only talks about life in australis but knows it and as this field of exertion occupies a large place in the ethical system he is helping to develope bia australian experience is worth a doctorate to the new teacher there are four stalwart lovers of a wayward heroine who marries unwisely and at last finds herself an orphan with an infant at the breast her husband a transported coiner he was transported by the judge to a place where he became captain of a gang of bushrangers killed his own son snd wss hung most of the other persons of ths story are transported also by the author to australia there it may be that the compactness of the plot suffers a little from the full and fresh impression of the country that the author has to give lt is a defect not to be quarrelled with the sketches sro all free and lifelike here is for example a suggestion of the writers quality the story passes from the

exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the artificial precincts of three volumes post 8vo no matter who or what the interlocutors may be mr henry kingsley however has written a book which the public will be more inclined to read than to criticize and we commend them to each other,history

the adventures of francois by s weir mitchell 6s macmlllan here is an excellent story the lightest the brightest that dr weir mitchell has yet produced a very close acquaintance with the history and the social conditions of france during the revolution and with the topography of old paris must have preceded the making of it but the learning is skilfully used and never obtruded franvois was a foundling and a chorister of notre dame to whom orderly life iwas made intolerable when his voice broke and he was threatened with the imprisonment of a monastery he took to the wild life of the streets and fought for his own handfor others too he was a goodhearted vagabond it is a novel thing to have a revolutionary story told from the point of view of an irresponsible rascal who cared little for either party though his instincts were royalist but who liked crowds and street riots because purses were loosely held then violence was abhorrent to his easygoing kindly if quite nonmoral nature he would have let politics alone but politics were of a meddling temper in those days and even the poor thief conjurer and fencingmasterfor he rose to that and did not even stop therehad to hold the staircase of a chateau against a mob was a suspect and was imprisoned amongst aristocrats too by a pleasant irony of fate his irrepressible gaiety carried him through strange passes in his life and the triumph of the book is that in the alleged gaiety of fransois we really believe we are infected by it the lighter side of a tragic time has never been so successfully touched before,history

those who have become sentimentally indulgent towards italian fascism merely because it has lasted a long time and has imposed silence upon the protests of humane and civilised people will do well to read signor silones novel the book has been banned in italy it is almost becoming a canon of criticism that modem dictatorships cannot stand good books and that good writers cannot stand dictators fontamara is an exceedingly good book it describes how a remote  semisavage  italian village living as it has for generations on the starvation line is brought into contact with fascism and is systematically robbed of its means of living by the upstart fascist contractors the story is told with calculated and cunning simplicity by the peasants themselves with faintly satirical wonder with a sly feigning of incomprehension of the intent of their persecutors and with a simple but blasting humour faced by this inscrutable childlike quality and malice of the peasants the fascists can do nothing else but beat them up and kill them which they do this is a very moving and very subtle book purged of hatred but quite dear in its purpose its didactic purpose is web assimilated if it is not invisible the story is an object lesson to those novelists who are preoccupied with the social crisis of our time but who are overwrought about their material the book reminded me of strindbergs tale of conflict between town and county the one called paul and per the other novels on this list also deal with crucial contemporary issues thus they are rescued from that futility which has overtaken the rootless novel of personal relationships in its tedious decline mr john fishers english and american expatriates in their sicilian hotels and villas are people attempting to escape from the modern world while living on it this he shows is the bourgeois dilemma he has not much prose styleit tends to the scenic cataloguebut his people are firmly stated and he knows how to construct an exciting story land of promise is about the jews of the ukraine it raises not the problem of decadence but of survival against a perfidy and persecution which have shocked europe when ludendorff needed jewish support for the war he promised a liberty and security which the jews had not known for generations escaping from the pogrom during the revolution a jewish family remembers the promise and goes to germany today we know with what aryan honour the ludendorff promise was kept the familys bitter sufferings are movingly described one icollows the incredible resignation of the flunible rosenberg a jewish lawyer who is spiritually uprooted from his race and who wins the iron cross during the war is brutally murdered by the nazis here again is an economical realistic political novel unremarkable for its psychological treatment but with its politics tolerably well in hand i have left the best book until the end herr traven wrote the death ship and his present novel which deals with an expedition in search of gold in mexico is by far the best i have read this year it is not perfect its tone is perhaps too laconic cool and bitter its restraint may be considered monotonous and posed its end to have a forced moral tone even so the treasure of the sierra madre surpasses in suspense excitement psychological profundity moral and social sgestiveness and skill of narrative any of the weekly batch of  masterpieces  advertised in the sunday press three men dobbs curtin and howard living in the squalor of a mexican oil port are so conditioned by corruption of the placei mean the financial exploitation of the workers by the richthat they turn to speculative escape in the common mexican stories of hidden gold in the mountains to work is useless but gold means power dobbs is a downandout curtin is a cut above him and howard is an old prospector the men have no friendship for one another they go up to the mountains set to work on the mine they discover plan what they will do with their share defend the venture against bandits and finally depart after months of gruelling slavery no more tied to one another than they were at the beginning it happens that the old man is obliged to stay behind in an indian village and dobbs and curtin drive on agreeing to bank the old mans share dobbs the downandout the man whom plutocratic exploitation has rendered completely cynical and amoral proposes to rob the old man and to share with curtin but curtin refuses he cannot rob a man of the fruits of his work to dobbs the underdog gold is not the fruit of work but of luck dobbs plots to murder curtin and the most tense situation in a book which contains many now is built up i will not give away the secret of this extraordinary psychological duel in the mexican mountains the treasure of the sierra madre is a humane and powerful book quivering with life and of all the novels on this list it has come nearest to solving the problem of being contemporary without letting the

the deluge an historical novel of poland sweden and russia by henryk sienkiewicz translated from the polish by jeremiah curtin 2 vols dont  co weare glad of the attempts which are now being made to familiarise the english public with the writings of henryk sienkiewicz the most eminent of living polish novelists some time ago the first romance of his great historical trilogy 4 fire and sword  was reviewed in the columns of this journal 4 the deluge  forms the second and we hope messrs dent will give us the third 4 pan michael sienkiewicz appears to have led a wandering life and was for some years in america but resides we believe at present in warsaw like count tolstoi he loves to put a great many figures on his canvas which is crowded with pictures of battle and adventure he contrives also to introduce the leading historical personages of the period and following the example of the late anthony trollope carries some of his imaginary characters through a whole series of novels thus in 4the deluge we have the reappearance of pan zagloba a thoroughly falstaflian individual whose adventures are legion and his bombast and selflaudation inexhaustible the history of poland is so little studied in this country that the facts upon which the novel is based will be familiar to few we must therefore go a little into detail the period of 4 the deluge  is that of the reign of john casimir in which poland suffered from all the ills of foreign and civil war an amiable but weak man he ascended the throne in 1649 and married his brothers widow marie louise a woman of beauty and spirit in his reign the swedes invaded the country and took both cracow and warsaw and he was obliged to fly into silesia their success would not have been so great had not the entranceinto the country been made easy by the treachery of opalinski the palatine of posen and radziwill the hetman of lithuania karl gustav the swedish king meditated parcelling out the country giving portions to the elector of brandenburg the hetman and others but the swedes were driven out polands hour had not yet come in 1668 john casimir abdicated all these characters figure in the picturesque pages of m sienkiewicz opalinski who wrote some venomous satires on the universal corruption of mankind is brought before us with all his odious characteristics radziwill appears as the evil spirit of the story and dies in great suffering he is portrayed as a gloomy ambitious man and is made additionally odious on account of his calvinism which stands in strong relief to the fanatical roman catholicism of his countrymen the hero is a gallant young polish noble who is desperately in love with a charming girl panna alexandra or in its pretty abridged form olenka he is induced at first to take the side of radziwill but when ho discovers that he is a traitor he deserts the cause of the powerful hetman it is this change of front that gets him into trouble after hairbreadth escapes he contrives to make his way to the king in silesia his devotion to the cause of john casimir is profound he distinguishes himself in many engagements and finally receives the hand of the young lady of whom he is

patrick gordon afterwards the friend of peter the great this fine specimen of the scotch younger son and mercenary soldier of the period has told us in his diary how being frequently taken prisoner he passed from one party to the other now fighting with the swedes and now with the poles it only remains in conclusion to say some words on mr curtins translation he has long since won his spurs as a worker in slavonic fields he is accurate almost to baldness and we think that on many occasions he might have given a footnote for we cannot imagine what the english reader will think of some of the expressions left unexplained eg the snitch to adopt the translators spelling so also to interpret the polish for constantinople as the city of the tsar cargrad is rather confusing it would have been better to say the city of the caesars the many americanisms are of course in the natural order of things whatever our translator gains in accuracy by his phonetic spelling of polish names he seems to lose in the hideous form which he communicates to all the native words we do not think our polish friends can possibly be pleased with these transformations he might by the way have given tylsa its

the refugees of the oftenquoted dangers a novelist encounters when he ventures into the regions of history mr conan doyle has at all events escaped one he has spared us some of the remembrance of his reading at no point is the tale overloaded with historical or scenic lore the material indeed is of the simplestfor one continent some scenes in the life of the grand monarch and his court at versailles in its decadence mesdames de amontespan and de maintenon the fallen and the rising stars a few stock personages such as bossuet louvois peer la chaise for the other still less and so far good the scantiness of the detail is all in favour of imagination having free play but unfortunately his imagination has failed him in the historical chapters of the novel and louis bossuet racine corneille the less madame de maintenon and the others are dwarfed and stiffened out of life their characteristic speeches have the effect of labels fastened on to help in their identification no doubt louis said or adopted the famous  letat cest moi but that is an excellent reason why a novelist who wishes to make the king act his part to the life should be chary of putting the actual words into his mouth madame de maintenon is made to overdo the rdle of virtue and is represented as an unattractive schoolmarm many will wish the scene with corneille had been omitted it is there to no purpose and though it is only thomas still there was enough family likeness between him and the proudest the most uncourtierlike of poets to make the fawning improbable even his recent election to the academy could hardly have reduced him to such a reptile condition if thomas corneille ever was actor in such a scene it might have remained unrecorded here but the historical part should not be taken too seriously after all it is the unhistorical huguenot refugees de catinat the gallant frenchman and his brave adele with amos green the stalwart young hero from the maine forests that we are meant to be interested in and as mr conan doyle can always tell a story their adventures are really entertaining in the little craft of ephraim savage the pious new englander they escape to the new world there to fall into new perils from the terrible iroquois who are at war with the french there is scalping and burning and torturing to a terrible extent but our little band escape the personages on the american side of the water historical and otherwise are certainly not puppets amos green is a bigger harry sandford he has a limited  the refugees a tale of two continents by a conan doyle 3 vols longmans 25s 6d admiration for civilization and true to the traditions of his kind his unsophisticated honesty of nature is joined to a native shrewdness beside which the mere training of courts and camps shows at a disadvantage perhaps there is a little too much of the burlesque about him on his firt day in paris he says  must i sleep in a room  then stepping across to the window overlooking the courtyard  ah he cried  there is a beechtree there mademoiselle and if i might take my blanket out yonder he finds it hard to find bis way about the wilderness of paris but he has his plans of

be hard to pick up ones trail again with so many folk ever passing over it with such a fresh child of nature the path through the story cannot be dull in one respect mr doyle has really shown originality he has invented no love complications a mere commonplace storyteller would have made amos and de catinat quarrel for the hand of adete but no amos it is true hangs a man by the feet from a balcony who insults her but he doesnt fall in love with her very sensibly he marries  a dutch maiden of schenectady whose acquaintance we are not privileged to make  the refugees by a conan doyle 3 vols longmans  co we have read dr conan doyles spirited tale of two continents with considerable pleasure he has chosen for his period the epoch of the revocation of the edict of nantes his heroes and heroines are huguenots and greatly daring ho does not hesitate to introduce as leading personages in his narrative the roi soleil himself and most of his attendant luminaries in dealing with madame de maintenon dr conan doyle accepts without reserve the later version of her life and character which holds her up to esteem as a pure woman and devoted wife of his three volumes two are devoted to the intrigues of the french court and the third to the adventures of the refugees in america we cannot help thinking that the novel would have been more successful had the new world been more liberally treated in regard of space dr doyles robust imagination is hardly in its element in the artificial atmosphere of the court of louis x1tv and he emerges with credit rather than with distinction from the ordeal of inventing dialogues in which bossuet fonelon corneille conde and louvois are all conscientiously introduced his prodigious young new englander amos green is worth all the portraits of historical personages who crowd the canvas of twothirds of his tale in the last volume however the author gives a free rein to his adventurous fancy and proves himself a formidable rival on their own ground to capt main beid mr clark bussell and mr bider haggard outside the pages of  monte cristo there were never such hairsbreadth escapes or such marvellous coincidences capt ephraim savages shark story and the narrative of the wreck on the iceberg are worthy of the invention of a descriptive reporter on a new york daily paper as an antidote to the photographic realism practised by so many of his contemporaries we can cordially recommend dr doyles exhilarating amalgam of horrors and heroism,history
two prisoners  two prisoners by lajos zilahy translated by joseph collins and ida zeitlin 8s 6d net heinemann while reading the first dozen pages of this long novel one receives the impression that the author has made a mistakethat he is a miniaturist engaged in painting a panorama the detail is so shrewdly so delightfully described that it would seem as if the vast landscape will never be unfolded as it ought to be to the spectator yet very gradually we notice that our fears are unfounded for a most skilful artist is at work the shapeliness of the various trees does not hold us for so long that we are unable to appreciate the glories of the forest peter and miette his wife are the two prisoners of the titlehe in the actual bonds of war in russia she more subtly in budapest the capital of her own afflicted land the reader is wafted to and fro passing from the life of the captive soldiers to that of the folk who await themor dread their arrivalat home scores of incidents some of them most minute yet never too trivial serve to give us an extraordinarily accurate knowledge of all these people we feel as if not only peter and his charming pathetic all too human miette but the numerous subsidiary characters have no secrets from us zamak the orderly would that he could have met that czech his opposite number the  good soldier sweich  and golgonszky the diplomat and olga the unfortunate and a multitude of othersshall we ever forget them  scene after scene is lit up with imagination miettes father having diedwhich process occupies ten absorbing pagesthe old servant is heard sobbing  an old womans sobs gentle and monotonous like the plaintive buzzing of a fly fallen into a spiders web in this beautiful amber one may note a very small fly so that it be removed in the second edition the author tells us that golgonszky before the war served as an attache at moscow of course  old mother moscow was not then the capital on the other hand the author adds considerably to our knowledge and he does it without the least ostentation for example we now know a good deal about that distant siberian town tobolsk we know in what quarters of it the female inhabitants are comely and we know far more about the ostyaks and their habits than was previously the case these sagacious if illiterate persons reject paper roubles scornfully but cling to enormous quantities of the precious metals  but what the ostyak in the midst of his tundras the almost limitless marshland known only to this people does with his treasure which never again appears in circulation has remained for centuries a dark mystery the psychology of peter and mfiette is of course the principal feature of the book we perceive not merely how from the beginning they react upon each other and how after their separation they are influenced by their environment but how even then they are more or less controlled despite the thousands of miles between them by each other  look out you might stumble had been peters last words to her as she distraught with grief had run along the railway lines when the train was carrying her young husband to the war these words echo and echo through the book it is a sad book but the sadness is clothed in beauty it is a long book but we would not miss a page of it henry baerlein,history
the nameless castle a novel translations of foreign fiction by maurus j6kai translated from the hungarian by s e bogga under the authors supervision jarrold  sonsthe novels of maurus j5kai are making their appearance one after the other in the english language to judge by some expressions used we are inclined to think that in this instance the translation comes from america we have on previous occasions given our opinion of jdkai in these columns he constructs his plots skilfully his descriptions are picturesque and his tales are amusing more than this we cannot say except that he commands a gorgeous oriental diction the present story opens in paris where we are introduced to a wonderful company of female spies called cytheras brigade but the scene of most of it is in hungary and in a castle on the shores of lake einsiedel where a mysterious man lives who has a more mysterious little girl with him we must leave our readers to unravel the plot for themselves  in novels of thia kind if you know the story beforehand there is nothing to read finally after the death of the leading characters the castle itself is swallowed up by the lake which has long been slowly encroaching on its shores it goes gradually like the church at reculvers  or perhaps we might better compare it to the weird house of usher of edgar poeand nothing is left we might almost fancy that jdkai had taken his idea from the american author,history
geraldine of desmond 3 vols 12mo 1829this is all far far too elaborate in matter and manner for one half of it to be read by any soul breathing it is toil and trouble thrown any the writer had better have written the irish history and antiqui ties of the period in good set terms and abandoned her love tale thorouglhly has mjiss crumpe mistaken the taste of thc readers she expected to gratify if she imagined for a moment that her detailinigs of dresses anti pageantries however correct and curious or her political discussions however sound and perhaps scrviceablc elsewhere mixed up and suspending the interest of a tale small as it is would suit that taste nobody wvill or can tolerate any thing so wearisome when the object of readini is merely to kill timeand who has any other in realing tales of this kind  facts or what lays claim to the certainty of facts will bet attended to in a sober shape and so will political discussions in their places but not wlhere the writer perversely confounds the mnemory and blinds the judgls ment ly nmixini the real with the ficti tiousrelatin one thaing in the text and another in the notefabricating in one place and rectifying in a second gravity is one thing and gaiety another th e lady moreover conipetent and cultivated as she obviously is has missed the line of the  historical romance that line is easily drawn no admitted facts should be disturbed or distorted the imagination of the romancer is free only where ithe record fails the story of desmond had enough in it of what is nowadays called the romance of life and space and verse enough remained unoccupied by any known circumstances for the indulgence of the writers fancy  but whento give an instanceshe impeaches the irish chief before the lords and tries him in the full pomp of judicial splendour in westmninster hail  she does it in violation of the known fact that he was only examined before the council why should the author try him before the peers  because she has collected certain details of ceremony in unpublished miss which she lwishes to produce but if such was the motive it was her business to manage the matter better and not at once pervert facts and betray her own poverty miss c seems to think she is sticking close to history as is lerpetually hinted when an act or a phrase is assigned to one person which historically belongs to another desmond and his countess in flying from their enemies once stood up to their necks in a river  but miss c for the purposes of her story chooses to place her heroine the daughter in this comfortable position and consign the mother the meanwhile to a convent in his final extremity desmond exclaimed to the wretch who butchered him spare me i am earl of desmond  but the author makes him say spare her mieaning the heroine i am earl of desmnorid and then quietly observes in a note as if the change of the one little word made none in the sense the substitution of he for me is the only alteration i have made in desmonds dying words historical facts in short are placed here or placed there just as it best suits what appears to the author the interest of 1her narrative this however is plainly overstepping the bounds of the historical romance no liberties should be taken with authenlticated matters  and it is quite superfluous for there must always be roomi enough for the play of fiancy in the deficiencies of records the subject of the tale is the revolt and ruin of desmnondthe prince of a large portion of the south of ireland in the reign of elizabeth the fitzgeralds and the butlers were hereditary enernies and the chiefs personal foes ormiond was a protestant a lord of the pale and in favour with the court desmond a catholic the descendant of a family of english origin but ipsis ilibernis iiicrnior the acknowledged chief of the catholic partythe opponent of the palethe resister of political oppression and of course in ill odour at court in a conflict with oimonds feudatories lhe was taken prisoner and conveyed to ormonds castlewhere in disguise his daughter gained access to him and first fascinated ornionds son and whence he was at last released uipon galling terms  wrung into undutifulness as he well expressed it by his enemies he entered into schemes for the rescue of his country and the gratification of his own revenge  but before the committal of any overt act lhe was entrapped by the queens troops and carried to londonwhither his daughter again followed him in his absence his friends pursued the plan and found themselves in a condition to propose terms to the government and desmond was dispatched by the government to dublin to confirm them treacherously treated or suspecting it desmond made his escape before the compact was signed and openly took up arms against the queen joincel by a few spanish forces and sanctioned by the pope though occasionally successful lhe was finally beaten in detailhis castles one after another destroyedand himnself a wanderer and dying of hunger was killed for the price that had been setupon his head his vast estates were lavishled among the courtiersamong some perhaps who had been mainly instrumental in pushing him to extremities of whom raleigh got 40000 acres spencer the poet had above 3000 wdith these for the most part historical details is mixed up a tale of no great interest from the dearth of incident consisting of the loves of desmonds daughter and ormonds son she is of course all that is beautiful and intelligent but with all her accomplishments and wisdom ardent and impetuous as the most uncurbed of irish maidens tilarles too is the observed of all observersthe preux chevsaliera most faithful and impassioned lover and one who encounters perils upon perils to prove bis devotion and win his ladys love but filial duty and the claims of patriotism bind her to her fathers destiny whose wanderings she shares and whose death she witnessescthe sight of which also added to previous exhaustion kills the unhappy maid herself the main object of the accomplished writer is of course to exhibit inl detail the miserable management of ireland in the reign of elizabeth and this is successfully done there can be little doubt the irish were driven into rebellion for the sake of forfeitures the queen herself when reports of the rebellion were brought to the council exclaimed if it goes on it will be better for you for there will be estates foryou all the most spirited parts ofthe work are the scenes where elizabeth figures coarse and imperious to the life the reader will of course take our opinion relative to this performanceone of no little pretension he may gather from its mag nificent prefacefor what it is worth but it is only fair to let him know that the work has been honoured by the approval of one of the first critics of the agethe right hionourable the lord rector of the university of glasgowthat is mr thomas campbell who it may be safely presumed by the

the linwoods or sixty years since in america by miss sedg wick churton holles street although the authoress of  hopeleslie  redwood and  the linwoods does not as a novelist possess the untiring activity of cooper the broad humour of paulding or such sudden bursts of keen vivacious satire as emitted by mrs trollope yet she is held by the transatlantic public with great justice in higher esteem than her american literary competitors her novels are imbued with an irresistible charm the charm of truth and by consequence its neverfailing companionthat of sympathy without the superfine metaphysical process of minutely scrutinising and portraying the secret mechanism the various movements and phases of the human heart miss sedgwick exhibits at once and without seeming effort the  open secret of our affections and impulses in a manner so quietthough not the less unerringas must engage the sympathies of every reader be they ever so homely moreover her characters are evidently not the creations of imagination but actual studies from the great life academy of nature we find in the novel before us no exaggerations of fact in no one instance a departure from probability but an easy calm and no less interesting flow of events presenting a more healthy nay greater source of excitement to the  reading public than the sudden transitions or  remarkable events  embodied by the great  wizard of the north himself the title of the book  sixty years since immediately refers its readers to the commencement of the american struggle for independencea retrospect peculiarly favourable to the novelist and of which the authoress of the linwoods has availed herself judiciously and effectively we shall present our readers with an extract affording a peculiarly favourable specimen of the description of talent we have given miss sedgwick credit for as also one of the easy unobtrusive humour she possesses it describes the parting of eliot lee from his family his village friends and the home of his childhood on starting to volunteer in the cause of his country  a fine black saddlehorse well equipped was at the door little fanny lee stood by him patting him and laying her head with its shining flaxen locks to his side  rover she said with a trembling voice be a good roverwont you  and when the naughty regulars come canter off with eliot as fast as you can  hey thats fine   retorted her brother a year younger than herself no no rover canter up to them and over them and never dare to canter back here if you turn tail on them rover oh sam how awful would you have eliot killed no indeed but i had rather hed come deused near it than to have him a coward  dont talk so loud sambessie will hear you but the young belligerent was not to be silenced he threw open the dwellingroom door to appeal to eliot himself the halfuttered sentence died away on his lips he entered the apartment fanny followed they gently closed the door drew their footstools to eliots feet and quietly sat down there how instinctive is the sympathy of children how plain and yet how delicate its manifestations  bessie was sitting beside her brother her head on his shoulder and crying as if her heart went out with every sob the youngest boy hal sat on eliots knee with one arm around his neck his cheek lying on bessies dropping tear after tear sighing and halfwondering why it was so  the good mother had arrived at that age when grief rather congeals the spirit than melts it her lips were compressed her eyes tearless and her movements tremulous she was busying herself in the last offices doing up parcels taking last stitches and performing those services that seem to have been assigned to women as safetyvalves for their effervescing feelings  a neat table was spread with ham bread sweetmeats cakes and every delicacy the house affordedall were untasted not a word wvas heard except such broken sentences as  come bessie i will promise to be good if you will to be happy   eliot how easy for youhow impossible for me  dear bessie do be firmer for mothers sake for ever oh no my dear sister it will not be very long before i return to you and while i am gone you must be every thing to mother  i i never was good for any thing eliotand now  abessie my dear child hushyou have beenyou always will be a blessing to me dont put any anxious thoughts into eliots mindwe shall do very well without him  s noble disinterested mother trembled on eliots lips but he suppressed words that might imply reproach to bessie  the sacred scene was now broken in upon by some wellmeaning but untimely visitors eliots approaching departure had created a sensation in westbrook tle good people of that rustic place not having arrived at the refined stage in the progress of society when emotion and fellowfeeling are not expressed or expressed only by certain conventional forms first entered master hale with miss sally ryal master hale  hoped it was no intru sion and miss sally answered by no means she had come to lend a helping hand and not to intrude whereupon she bustled about helped herself and her companion to chairs and unsettled every body else in the room mrs lee assumed a more tranquil mien poor bessie suppressed her sobs and withdrew to a window and eliot tried to look composed and manly the children like springs relieved from a pressure reverted to their natural state dashed off their tears and began whispering among themselves miss sally produced from her workbag a comforter for mr eliot of her own knitting which she  trusted would keep out the cold and rheumatism  and she was kindly showing him how to adjust it when she spied a chain of braided hair around his neck ah ha mr eliot a love token she exclaimed   yes it is said little fanny who was watching her proceedings bessie and i cut locks of hair from all the childrens heads and mothers and braided it for him and i guess it will warm his bosom more than your comforter will miss sally  it was evident from the look of ineffable tenderness eliot turned or fanny that he  guessed so too but he nevertheless received the comforter graciously hinting that a lady who had been able to protect her own bosom from the most subtle enemy must know how to defend anothers from common assaults miss sally hemmed looked at master hale muttered something of her not always having been invulnerable and finally succeeded in recalling to eliots recollection a tradition of a lovepassage between miss sally and the pedagogue  a little girl now came trotting in with  grandmothers love and a phial of her mixture for mr eliotgood against campdistemper and the like  eliot received the mixture as if he had all grandmothers faith in it slipped a bright shilling into the childs hand for a keepsake kissed her rosy cheek and set her down with the children  visitors now began to throng one man in a green old age who had lost a leg at bunkers hill came hobbling in and clapping eliot on the shoulder said  this is you my boy this is what i wanted to see your fathers son adoing id go too if the rascals had left me both my legs cheer up widow and thank the lord youve got such a son to offer up to your countrythe richer the gift the better the giver you know but i dont wonder you feel kind o qualmish at the thoughts of losing the lad come master hale cant you say something a little bit of greek or latin or most any thing to keep up their perits at the last gasp as it were  i was just going to observe major avery to mrs lee respecting our esteemed young friend mr eliot that 1 who have known him from the beginning as it were having taught him his alphabet which may be said to be the first round of the ladder of learning which he has mounted by my help or rather if you will allow me maam to mend my figure the poles that support all the rounds having had as i observed a primordial acquaintance with him i can testify that he is worthy every honourable adjective in the language and we have every reason to hope that his future tense will be as perfect as his past  wheugh   exclaimed the major  a pretty long march you have had through that speech   the good schoolmaster quite unruffled proceeded to offer eliot a timeworn virgil and finished by expressing his hopes that  he would imitate caesar in maintaining his studies in the camp and keep the scholar evenhanded with the soldier  eliot charmed the old pedagogue by assuring him that he should be more apt at imitating caesars studies than his soldiership and himself bestowed virgil in his portmanteau of a good lady now stepped forth and seeming somewhat scandalised that as she said  no serious truth had been spoken at this peculiar season she concluded a technical exhortation by giving eliot a pair of stockings into which she had wrought st pauls description of the gospel armour the scripture she feared did not often find its way to the camp and she thought a passage might be blessed as a single kernel of wheat even sowed among tares sometimes produced its like  eliot thanked her and said  it was impossible to have too much of the best thing in the world but he hoped she would have less solicitude about him when he assured her that his mother had found place for a pocket bible in his portmanteau  a meeklooking creature now stole up to mrs lee and putting a roll of closelycompressed lint into her hand said  tuck it in with his things miss lee dont let it scare youi trust he will dress other peoples wounds not his own with itmy that will come natural to him its made from the shirt mr eliot stripped from himself and tore into bandages for my poor sam that time he was scalt mr eliot was a boy then but he has the same heart now  mrs lee dropped a tear on the lint as she stowed it away in the closelypacked portmanteau we cannot resist quoting an anecdote of the hero of the above cleverly depicted scene related of him during his introductory visit to general washidgton it is amusing and characteristic  ah my boy  said the colonel determined to tell his tale out  you may say thattheres no courage like that that comes by natur general he stood within two feet of me as straight as a

the continental dragoon  a love story of philipse manor house in 1778 by robert neilson stephens ward lock  co we have lately had so many romances by american writers which dealt with french history that it is refreshing to come upon one the author of which has been content to find materials in the history of his own country mr stephens has based his story upon the actualities out of which grew the united states of america and has woven a pretty romance out of simple materials the philipse manor house was situate on the  neutral ground  which lay between the circle of kings troops about new york and the arc of the american forces opposed to them caprice takes a lovely young woman from new york to this place and circumstance sends there a  rebel captain who ends by winning the love of his captor the whole action takes place in a week but it is a week notable for many exciting adventures crisply described the story reads like a drama made into a novel and if it be not such then it might well be dramatized the one serious fault is the lengthy and somewhat heavy manner in which the author works up to the real action the matter of the first fifty pages might have been indicated in five and the readers pleasure enhanced at the expense of his knowledge of american history,history
beatrix of clare by john reed scott e grant richards to those who enjoy a good historical romance we can thoroughly recommend mr scotts new novel the period is that of richard iii the hero being one of his body knights and the heroine a beautiful countess in her own right a ladyinwaiting to the queen the author has made good use of his opportunities the story is pleasantly told in a straightforward way and though the plot is not particularly original the characters are well drawn and the interest both personal and historical is maintained the four coloured pictures by clarence f underwood are good  beatrix of clare by john reed scott e grant richards 6s   the hero of mr scotts new novel is a young knight in the service of the duke of gloucester and consequently richard iii is adorned with many virtues which the historians have not seen fit to allow him sir aymer de lacy however is his enthusiastic follower from the moment he is tended by beatrix countess of clare to the end of a story which conveniently stops a short time before the battle of bosworth field historical novels are written very glibly nowadays and it is seldom that a writer can avoid the use of the wellknown ingredients  beatrix of clare  begins with a highway robbery sir aymer being the victim and the scene is conducted with a chivalry that does credit to all concerned beatrix the richest heiress in england meets the wounded knight and the result is love at first sight of cgurse there is the bold bad rival and when the heiress is kidnapped by the wicked lord darby sir aymer proceeds to rescue herby a series of daring exploits space is found however for suchhistorical incidents as the crowning of richard theexecutionsof hastings and the duke of buckingham and the deaths of the princes in the tower on the whole the book is interesting mainly because it makes no great tax on the imagination  and mr scott writes forcibly and with an enthusiasm for the mediaeval that suggests an american origin in this connexion the reviewer is tempted to point out the incongruity of a spelling which though for the most part american occasionally drops into the employment of the obsolete words like  traveler and  favour  arefollowed by  gaiety  and  gayly this is a fault that will irritate the observant reader however  beatrix of clare  can be recommended to those in search of a readable novel there is almost as much colour in the prose as there is in the illustrations of mr clarence underwood,history

  my lady of the north by randall parrish putnams sons this tale of the american civil war has much vivid adventure and realistic fighting in it there is also a pleasant love story but the gallant southern captain is very obtuse in not finding out till so very late in the day that his ladylove was a widow not a wife we leave them however without any misgiving for their future unless a tendency to talk which is rather tall should prove occasionally fatiguing there is a comic man with a virago and a mule who relieves some tragic situations and the book is very well illustrated,history
monthly review of literature domestic and foreign gaston de blndeille or the court of mharu iii keeping festival in ardxen a rolwe by mrs raddiffa 1826 in the memoir of mrs radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes there is so comprehensive and altogether so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy ite breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated departed spirits alas alas gaston de blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to the writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department now we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature the primary ones themselves i love hate ambition jealousy avarice have f their entrances and exits inthe breast but  c these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so i large a space in the basis of all characters c that they are usually and readily excitable ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production and a after even the

persecution of a royal favourite the old plea of magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt

for their wondrous ease grace and simplicity assuri illy the author of calavar is not of the latter school yet lie is not without merit his genius is of a poetic order ami his feelings are manly and heroic  calavnr is a story of the conquest of mexico cortes and his companions appear m the scene and with their varied fortunes are mingled thc wild madness of the hero of the narrative and the loves of amador a spanish hidalgo and leila a princess of the moors how all these characters and many others happened to meet in mexico we have not leisure to relate suffice it to say that cortez was there from love of conquest leila and her father from accident or misfortune calavar because he sought in the scenes of the new xvorld relief from remorse felt for wrongs he had wrought in the old and a mailor from a desire to share in the good or evil fortune of the latter regardless of cortes and all his schemes of blood and ambition the interest of the story abides with amador and his moorish princess the young lady in the disguise of a page or minstrel hoy attends him through many a dread adventure while he all unconscious of her presence causes her to play airs which his leila loved and songs expressive of her atlcction and her fortunes at length during one of those days of blood and peril in which the spaniards xvere repulsed from the capital of mexico leila was discovered by amador

upon its shores all the xviii and tameless spirits of europe were for nearly a century thrown and deeds were dared and done equalling or surpassing the exploits ascribed to heroes in romantic verse we think the author of  calavar has erred in uniting his love story with an event so well known and so saddening to the ininti as the conquest of mexico we regret it the more because we think the

  literatube the city of sunshine the citij of sunshine by alexander allardyce w blackwood and sons as a rule there is no more unromantic mortal living than the angloindian the  gryphon  and enthusiastic specials who skim the surface of the land in a cool season are indeed prone to break into glowing periods concerning the gorgeous east but the effect produced upon the european character by any prolonged residence in the most picturesque and at the same time the most humourous country in the world would appear to be almost invariably commonplaceness and unalterable gravity the reason is not of course difficult to discover there are awkward practical qualities underlying indian picturesqueness and indian absurdity which tend to detract from their charm with though national prepossession in favour of the more solid virtues it is difficult for the average englishman to retain any delight in the flowery jungle or the fairylike grotesqueness of though native bazaar when he has learned that the one means lurking snakes and poisonous miasmas and the other any number of grave offences against salubrity in the same way he ceases to be attracted by patriarchal habits and romantic beliefs when he finds that these by no means indicate the manly qualities of energy and uprightness but after all it is a part of the englishmans philistinism his meiitorious philistinism no doubt but philistinism notwithstanding to dislike or despise the romance of india because of her deficient respectability this deficiency is not to be denied  as far as thc respectable virtues go india has some cause to feel ashamed but her shortcomings here are after all but negatiae qualities thc result of applying to her a foreign standard the positive quality the distinguishing fact about herself and her people is not respectability nor the lack of respectability but romance she is only to be seen truthfully and interpreted justly when looked at from the romantic viewpoint so that it is really to le regretted that just those people who know most about ber refuse either to see or to paint her for us under this her most lovable and vital aspect mr allardyce ave hasten to say forms a brilliant exception to though rule evidently he is under no illusions himself as to the character of the mild hindoo ho does not attempt to attribute to him any of the heroic virtues nor does he represent india after though manner of the gushing special as a paradise of luxuriant splendour he is content to paint her as he finds her as imagination and experience have shoavn her to himwith all her faults and aveakness her unreliability caprices and deceits but at the same time with all her dreamy fascination  her grace her pathetic tenderness above all her poetry which hides a multitude of sins the  city of sunshine as its description stands in our novel will do for the picture of almost any bengal village of tolerable size there is the picturesque little temple under the fluttering peepnltree though dilapidated but imposinglooking mansion of the poor native nobleman of the place  the tawdry stucco dwelling of the rich mabajan or moneylender  and then the street of quaint little open shops either linc broken here and there by high brick avails oaershadowed by largeleaved plantains mr allardyce is sufficient artist to people his little world with none save living and typical men and av omen ave have no layfigures no ghosts to fill up empty niches and corners all bis characters from ram la ll the greedy oilman to gangooly the simple garrulous headman of thc village  from kristo lahory the proud and poor brabmau to three shells the moneylender and arillain of the story are true not only to life bnt to natiate life the reader may learn as much from studying even this little side group of secondary personages as from spending many hours in the actual dust and heat and bustle of an indian bazaar but there are two studies of a much higher dramatic order testifying not only to the authors exceptional grasp of the shades and colour of character but also of his clear sense of the very questionable improvement for moral worth or personal happiness to bo effected by encouraging young india to make one mouthful of all european intellectualism much after the manner that the ancestral sage vasistha swalloaaed the thunderbolt of brahma  with much the samo results alsoof sore inward burnings and outward vomitings of smoke inasmuch as the noble human spirit or thc spirit which just falls short of being noble is always a higher matter of study than the oddities and drolleries of vulgar natures krishna gossain the faithless apostle of the brahma somaj is a more interesting creation than romesh chunder roy otherwise mr r c roy of the calcutta bar the anglicised baboo who has tasted the delights of one years spoiling and petting in london but mr r c roy is deliciously lifelike with his  enlightenment his quotations from shakespeare his poems patent leather boots contempt for his countrymens prejudices and withal his imperturbable goodhumour krishna is as ave have said of a noble type  he is the son ofthe kindly and cultured old priest of dhupnagar and has been sent by his father to calcutta to learn not though heresies but the wisdom of thc sahibs here he associates himself with the neav sect of thc brahma somaj and avc have him in the first scene tearing off and discarding his brahminical cord as a solemn preparation for the life of persecution and hardship he is eager to court as a national reformer in truth his zeal is real and earnest he is quite ready to meet martyrdom in attempting to reclaim bis countrymen from their idolatrous superstitions but avorse dangers than persecution beset bis faith instead of disinheriting or heaping reproaches on his son the kindly old priest receives him with tender pity and sets about contriving a marriage for him with a hindoo girl for avhom he has conceived a pas sion little by little krishnas new religious fervour melts away under the influence of his love and his fathers generous kindness though romantic attractions of the old religion begin to exercise a dreamy charm over him  and in the very midst of all these influences the calcutta theistical society commit though error of sending down to dhupnagar mr lt c roy so as to confirm and strengthen his flickering faith krishna has all though poetic sensitiaeness and refinement of the higbcasto oriental and the shallow vulgarity and hybrid anglicism of his lowborn countryman finish the work of bia demoralisation and the smoking flax is quenched though scene in which mr r c roy arrives at dhupnagar is so humorous that wo cannot forbear from quoting it forth from the palanquin crawled a man of middle stature with skin mackel than the blackest native of dhupnagar but dressed foppishly after though manner ofthe angloindian dandies of calcutta an enormous sola or pithhat covered with yellow silk and resembling in

show a dirty shirtfront garnished with gold studs and a pair of stifflystarched white trousers which had apparently been just put on to enhance the solemnity of the wearers entrance into dhupnagar his feet wero encased in natty little boots of shining patent leather and he wore a necktie of though most gorgeous colours kings pins watchchains and charms with precious stones dug from though mines of

fathers had been headmen of dhupnagar since though british had obtained the stewardship of bengal behar and orissa and have you no hotels in this benighted and heavenforsaken hamlet my good friend

should do with this awkward arrival we must of course let mr allardyce himself unfold the intricacy and detail of krishnas descent from the high moral position of a national reformer to the easy tolerance of a cultured hindoo whoso favourite maxim is that  there is no creed so bad but it may serve to comfort some poor soul but the reader may take our word for it that though krishnas course may be considered by some a doavnward one he never fails to carry with him our sympathy and interest another excellent lifepicture is mr eversley the collector an angloindian of the oldfashioned type who gets lectured by the enlightened modern newspapers for his roughandready manner of deciding cases and his inferiority to a model young civilian muffington prig aadiose reports are always drawn up

one is that it refuses to take a lively interest in india but this accusation is no longer well founded  there is a growing desire to know and understand india better and a few more such romances as

an obvious potboiler the character of sir richard pendragon in fortunt is whimsical and stirring but even in this very jolly book it is obvious that mr snaith does not take himself seriously as a writer of romance he does not approach his work with the imperturbable seriousness of dumas or stevenson his romances are as void of any undercurrent of thought or passion as those of cutcliffe hyne or conan doyle ingenuity seeks in vain for one fiery outburst from the author of william 7ordan for one surpassing phrase to electrify this pleasant business of love and adventure knights and highwaymen it is hard to believe that the same pen that wrote such commonplace as mistress dorothy alarvin has given us two immortal descriptions of heroes who denied the world to save their genius what of it  it is enough for one lifetime to have produced broke of covinden henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior of these books the first alone has achieved any measure of success or fame it is the earliest worst written and least important yet it has fine comedy and profound tragedy the influence of meredith is very apparent in the picture of broke a more rigid more passionate stupider sir willoughby patterne in one passage an invocation to the audience at the olympian theatre the author lapses into a travesty of merediths very style the tutor one of natures gentlemen and gods poets who rescues the youngest most intelligent and least ugly of brokes six daughters from the horrors of a manage de cowenance is closely modelled on vernon whitford all this detracts a little from the excellence of the book and certain abominations of style which have also to be mentioned detract from it still more take for instance this sentence  a gallant but intrepid hound who took a somewhat informal departure from this life because he chose to cross a railway when hounds were in full cry at the moment the express from london had chosen to cross it also this is terrible we hear too of  a game rejoicing in the euphonious name of pingpong and of  that mysterious zoological specimen the consummate ass dickens himself never committed worse excesses than these in the way of cheap irony and we may add that mr snaith would be well advised to go through all his books and scratch out the word  somewhat  wherever it occurs nevertheless there is grandeur in the scheme of broke of covenden it is thrilling to read how blow upon blow fell upon the all but indomitable pride of the hero and not till the end will lie vield and the characters are more vivid more passionate than merediths meredith would never have shown us the fire in delias soul admirable too is uncle charles a bibulous and kindhearted nobleman beloved by everyone but his wife a literary lady who writes for the spectator whose character the author draws with more ferocity than finesse in a humorous chapter this insufferable dame is smacked by her longsuffering husband alas that the author should add  not in the authentic place  broke of covenden may then be classed as a fine book but imitative henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior resemble nothing but each other written in a style of fantastic beauty they both describe the soul of genius battling to keep its purity untainted in the material world they are spiritual tragedies already in broke of covenden the author is apt to make his characters speak not as they would have spoken but rather as their souls would have spoken already in the description of brokes final desolation we have a foretaste of the authors power of expressing the psychical  there were occasional fierce gushes of rain driven by the wind against the windowpanes of the cottage he mistook them for waves of blood breaking over the walls of his mind in the two later books the whole atmosphere is spiritual the real things are the things of the soul and the phenomenal world becomes a hideous and obscuring dream henry northcote is an advocate penniless and unknown in the prelude a dying and destitute stranger who has heard his oratory in hyde park comes to visit him they talk together about jesus and the need of a new failure a great renunciator like him  to restore the sense of illusion and to show that the strife for the perfect is not a chimaera of the madhouse the stranger vanishes and the same night northcote is given his chance he is to defend a prostitute from a charge of murder the case seems as hopeless as it is sordid the woman is guilty beyond all doubt but to northcote it seems an unholy thing that a woman should be hanged he exerts his amazing genius and procures a verdict of  not guilty the trial scene is dramatic and northcotes speech with its vision of an ideal jury and christ as foreman is great literature but northcote realises that he has worked not for his ideal but for himself his ideal self dies and the ideal self of the woman he has rescued perishes at the same time we leave him an incendiary and a murderer established on the road to worldly success the grim story is relieved by passages of a peculiar humour a humour that reminds one now of dickens now of baudelaires poemes en prose and like the book itself baffles all description hard as it is to give an account of henry northcote in a few lines it is harder still to suggest the characteristics of william 7ordan 7unior judged by the standard of the souls grand effort towards perfection henry northcote the advocate fails and william jordan junior the poet succeeds despite imprisonment poverty sickness and ridicule air snaith is perhaps the only writer of prose who has understood the poetic character his prose in its faults and merits is a poets prose throughout and the character of his poet must be founded on some mighty experience the frail boy is brought up by his aged father in a little bookshop he lives with the heroes of the iliad in a world of poetry and dreams he is terrified of the  streetpeople and as unfit for school or business as a fairy yet gifted with dauntless resolution he lives down his terrors one by one and does not die till he has written the poem it was his mission on earth to write there is nothing in literature like this story of a sublime spirit imprisoned in a wasting frame even the humour is unique who can ever forget the conversation of mr octavius crumpett the publisher with queen victorias favourite novelist  the novelist is in distress he has been offered a title mr crumpett tells him that he should accept it for the honour of literature the great author acquiesces with a sigh he says he can hardly imagine sir william shakespeare and no friendship in literature is more truly pathetic and charming than that of the poet ith the young matthew arnold dodsonan episode which keeps the story human and relieves the mad and stifling tragedy of its close in these days those who would proclaim  one genius more  can hardly hope for a hearing however just their arguments or good their cause we have no desire to be extravagant in our laudation of mr snaith he has given us only three books that are literature and only one masterpiecewilliam 7ordan 7unior but that work is unique and it is a masterpiece and it is all but unknown,history

tjie dove in the eagles nest new novels macmillan  co to combine moral teaching with interest is of all things the hardest for our part we regard the religious tag at the end of a novel with much the same respect as we do the crust at the lower side of an old bottle of choice port wine we would not disturb it for the world there are however persons who insist on your taking your dose of medicine well shaken together  but alas  in religious works the particles refuseto assimilate and at one time you have all the unctuousness of the oil at another all the sharpness of the vinegar and in no wise can the draught agree with your constitution the strange compound only nauseates your stomach the writer of  the dove in the eagles nest has managed to give us a clear pleasant tonic there are no lees and no muddy combination of perfect goodness and thorough wickedness we can confidently recommend the vintage the tale is in itself a beautiful moral and yet one does hot perceive that we are being lectured throughout where authors have a good purpose in view they should be doubly careful not to add to the stockintrade of the druggist who would not prefer a stroll through mr rimmels perfumery

henry viii  the scene is laid in germany under the emperors friedrich iii and maximilian we were much reminded of sir walter scotts novels ia perusing the book the same skilful use is made of real history how much have we all been indebted to novelwriters for our knowledge of history it would seem to us that shakespeares historical plays scotts novels and some others give a far greater insight into the past than the most careful collection of state documents there is as much difference as to the influence of such works on our memory and hearts as there is in attending a public meeting convened for taking some case into consideration and listening to ali which is said in a formal routine manner and being present at the occurrence itself where the touches of real life were so vividly

the ratpit by patrick macgill herbert jenkins 6s net this is a welter of misery and squalor it is to the authors credit that the irish and the scotch surroundings of his characters are suggestively differentiatedmore so indeed than the personages themselves who are rather deficient in distinctive features altogether the volume bears the stamp of veracity and firsthand experience the technique shows considerable improvement on the last work of mr macgill but he strikes us as not yet having attained a proper distance from the life he describes there is little substance in the tale and it is not only spun out to excessive length but also liable to degenerate into melodrama as in the closing scene or in that meeting of brother and sister that recalls maupassants story le port the chief defect is this that the handling is not sufficiently objective to turn the book into a purely artistic achievement while on the other hand it is too impersonal not bitter enough to gain its fullest possible force as an indictment of certain social conditions lastly we venture to think that the readers sympathies will not be sharpened but blunted by such a litany of suffering instead of rising exasperated from its perusal and vowing vengeance on a system which permits such atrocities he will heave a sigh of relief and feel thunderingly glad that the heroine has at last thought fit to die now whose fault is that is it the authors yet defective sense of measure or the publishers determination to have so many unnecessary thousand words for this sixshilling venture  the ratpit by patrick macgill jenkins g the author of  children of the dead end  has given us a second powerful novel which contains eyren more sordid incidents and the sordidness is less relieved by gleams of humour in fact the danger of the author haunted himself with the misery in the yvorld passing on such an obsession to his reader is a very real one in a time of great tragedy we are more ready perhaps to welcome a novel yvhich helps us to adjust our perspective better than this book as a portrayal of the women counterparts to the men in his former work it may serve a purpose we are not unfortunately in a position to deny that the life of fallen women reaches lower depths of degradation than that of the vagrant class among men though yve shall cherish doubts concerning thc writers opening scenes of irish life as long as we can lt is not that wc do not believe that there are extremes of selfishness to be found among the irish priesthood and merchants who in outoftheway parts grind the poor but if these pictures are taken from actual life then mr macgill has neglected a duty in not furnishing the world with chapter and verse the worst evil revealed in recent factory reports is the practice of paying outworkers with goods instead of money ie trucking with outworkers but mr macgill makes no allusion to this,history

th red rorer  tab  ttlk rkl kovkk bv the ai thou of  tin spy  the pilot  thc prairie c e s vols limo london lm2s avk must admit that in the present production of mr cooper we have been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the importance of possessing so interesting a legend to communicate   and such is also the name they give to his vessel because no mau who has put foot on board her has over come bael to say that she has a bettor or a

opinions differ some say yes some say no but 1 am well acquainted with a man who travelled a week in company with a mariner who passed within a hundred feet of her in a gale of wind lucky it was for thom that the hand of the lord was felt so powerfully on the deep and that though hover had enough to do to keep his own ship from foundering the acquaintance of my friend had a good view of both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest trader to keep off in order that though two vessels might not do one another damage by coming foul   he was a bold mariner that trader to go so nigh such n merciless rogue  1 warrant you lardon it was desperately against his will but it was on a night so dark   dark interrupted the other  by what contrivance then did he manage to see so well   no man can say answered the tailor  but so he did just in the manner and the very things 1 have named to you more than that ho took good note of the vessel that he might know her if chance or providence should over happen to throw her again into his way she was a long black ship lying low in the water like a snake in the grass with a desperate wicked look and altogether of dishonest dimensions then every body says that she appears to sail faster than the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy upon the motions of the ked rover who with a facility only to he met with in romance becomes acquainted with our hero anti is at once appointed to the first lieutenancy of the pirateship the descriptive portions of the work are without exception good and we quote the following picture of the cabin of the lied rover   the apartment in which our adventurer now found himself atrbrded no bad illustration of the character of its occupant in its form and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements  but in ils furniture anti equipments it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation the lamp which swung from the upper deck was of solid silver and though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity there was that in its shape and ornaments which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character massive candlesticks of the same precious metal and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation were on a venerable tible whose mahogany was glittering with the polish ol hail a century and whose gilded claws anti carved supporters bespoke au original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship a conch covered with cut velvet stood along the transom  while a divan of blue silk lay against the bulkhead oppoite inanifesin by its fashion its materials and its piles of pillows that even asia had been made to contribute to tue ease of its luxurious owner in addition to these prominent articles there were cut glass mirrors plate and even hangings each of which by something peculiar in il fashion or materials bespoke au origin iliiterent 1roai that of ils neighbour in short splendour and elegance seemed to have been mach more consulted than propriety or conformity in taste in the selection ol most of those articles which had been oddly enough made to contribute to the caprice or to cue comfort of their siiguia possessor  lu the midst of this medley of wealth rntl luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage

objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt is all in vain however the ship is on the point of sailing when most opportunely the captain breaks his leg and wilder is without loss of time nay on a live minutes intid uiatiou ol the tact installed

macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,history

norris 2 vols ward  downey amour de jeune pille par madame e caro paris calmann levy archdeacon farrar claims that his canvas of scenes in the days of nero shall not be judged as a novel  darkness and dawn is not indeed even so much as an historical novel for there is next to no construction of plot outside the grim narratives derived from tacitus seneca and their contemjoraries to connected narratives and otters dr farrar has added a multiplicity of materials from the literature of imperial rome at and after the close of the first century with vast labour and perseverance he must have ransacked the satires odes and epigrams as well as the longer works of the most polished latin authors in that most dissolute and demoralised age he has thus put together for the older and younger readers of a sensationloving age a record of deliberate refined and accumulated criminality of murder and lust and cruelty such as would scarcely be found in any other printed book easily accessible to young and impressionable minds though it is true that the author has somewhat softened down the crudest details of neros more ghastly crimes and has avoided altogether the worst features of the age dr farrar has painted this lurid picture for a definite and intelligible purpose in order to exhibit the golden vein of christian faith and profession running through the dense mass of pagan vice and bloodthirstiness and his story ends with the bright refulgence of that dominant faith which was to vanquish the empire of the world considerations of reticence and fastidiousness not to say of exact chronology seem more than once to have given way before the craving of the artist for an effective contrast and certainly it would be impossible to secure a contrast more sharp and striking than that which is here drawn between the ecstasies of the early christian faith and though stews and bloodpits of neros rome mr robertson also deserves credit for a manful effort to restore the historical novel could any man do so with success he would be a benefactor to the age but the aspirant must contend with many difficulties when the greatest of historical novelists aroused the interest of two nations and then of the world he had the benefit of the absence of the scientific historian and of the presence of a vague national pride in though past in our days every boy who has passed the fifth standard is a sworn cosmopolitan and our writers have agreed to bless humanity that they are rid of the dark days of old yet the popular ignorance of those days remains about the same again what subjective qualities must our author bring to the field accurate knowledge is now essential the poetic spirit which in history shows its practical side by grasping the motives of men was never more necessary local knowledgeso difficult in days when all men are wandering from home and scouring earth and sea for subsistencemust bo his  and he should be a past master in local diction the expression of local thought at a time when language is being stereotyped to the extinction of its virility that the author of  the lords of cuningham has not surmounted these difficulties is little to his discredit he has erred in prolonging the agony of his histoiy the feud of the cuninghams and montgomeries in ayrshire in the sixteenth century by too much otiopv6ia in the dialect of the nineteenth otherwise the alternative slaughter of clansmen might have read like a page of tho four masters still he has made some characters distinct lady elizabeth otherwise margaret montgomerie who is art and

stewart umquhile arran c who is brought on the stage as a philosopher retired from the world may be usefully remembered some solecisms as well as scotticisms may be commended to the authors attention to say that readers of the newgate calendar will enjoy mr barretts story is putting his merits too low there is much power in the delineation of olgas nature struggling instinctively after good in a hopeless overpowering element of sordid crime that she never has a chance never can escape the consequences of her birth the daughter of one felon and the granddaughter of another dependent on though latter for daily bread and in danger from the vengeance of the most untiring police in europeis too true to though probabilities of life though in such a case as olgas it would not have been inconceivable that she should have told truth and shamed the devil when first her heart was touched by lesleys affection but the circumstances of though crime at pangbourne most ingeniously complicated almost deprive her of any choice of action when once she has been compromised by the heartless isaakoff that consummate pretender imposing in every sense is nowhere moro true to himself than when he hoists the parkers with their own petard and goes off with his spoil in a state of virtuous indignation leaving his victims penetrated with shame at the shadow of suspicion cast on so gallant a gentleman and his granddaughter with no refuge but the arms of the lover whom she is by what seems force majeure compelled to mystify and deceive the taint of crime will be too overpowering for most readers and to our thinking verges on the repulsivenotably in the scene where isaakoff and the parkers wreak their mutual vengeance yet such a wholesome english character as evelyn and such touches of pathos as in olgas act when in her longing for reconciliation she puts the flowers from the pangbourne garden on her husbands table relieve the gloom which would otherwise have overweighted the story there are good points in  love or money with several weak ones it is well plotted out to begin with the poor parson with his numerous family and the pet child who contracts round her devoted head the main interests and troubles of this vivacious book are freshly drawn there is a very pretty picture too of a religious priga prig that is to say in spite of his religionwho receives his punishment at the hands of two of the vicars daughters one of these phil ferrars a scheming little worldling imperturbable in her selfreliance and utterly destitute of a conscience brings herself into grievous peril and is sentenced to be hanged out of this the author manages to get some strong situations one or two of which are skilfully managed albeit weakened here and there by incongruous touches thero are two lordlings a virtuous and a vicious who are somewhat wooden of their kind  but though characters of phil and her sisters are natural and well conceived welltold and stirring stories of the crimean campaign form though background of mr smarts new novel which shows no falling off in verve and liveliness from the usual calibre of his books miss smerdon is a sufficient beatrice bitterly selfdespising when the reported mishap of benedick major byng has broken through her crust of sarcasm and induced her to volunteer a letter to him which is all too curtly acknowledged polly tarrant nee phybbs is a tart and lively soubrette and it is quite in nature that she should work her fingers to the bone on behalf of a loutish husband younger than herself who accepts all her sacrifice as his due but hugh fleming and nellie lyndon are the leading actors after all nellie is a gentle creature but proud enough to resent what she is too well justified in regarding as deception fortunately hugh though for a time neglectful of duty in consequence of the fascinations of his charming russian nurse can exculpate himself from any grave default and things

  no i dont think so but i have heard men call her goodlooking  the negative qualities of mr norriss method were never better illustrated than in  miss wentworths idea it is full of artistic reserve it is entirely free from all sensationalism whether of style or incident and the charactors with hardly an exception never for a moment deviate from the plane of lifelikeness but more is wanted to make a novel interesting than excellent workmanship and truth to nature and for that additional and indispensable quality one looks in vain in though pages of  miss wentworths idea the antagonism of good and bad  form as society understands the term is depicted with unfaltering skill but of charm or pathos there is not an iota from beginning to end a discreet and elegant cynicism is the prevailing note of the book  whatever sympathy is excited in the mind of the reader is certainly not on though side of the angels it is difficult to find much to say of madame caros novel except that

new novels fort amity by a t quillercouch i  murray mr couch gallantly maintains the flag of adventurous fiction first hoisted in modern days by scott born high for a couple of generations by him and his various successors for a time eclipsed towards 1850 and onwards by the novel of common lifeincluding the police court  and revived in our own days mainly by stevenson since stevenson died he has been perhaps the most able exponent of this school at any rate the one whom persons of wholesome tastes and a tincture of education can read with most pleasure yet somehow his books nearly always leave the impression that he has not yet wholly  found himself his construction or what in a picture would be called composition is apt to want balance though the details are admirably painted the practice of introducing an historical personage at the beginning of the story and then leaving him entirely out of it till the very end when he becomes prominent again without having in any way contributed to the progress of the narrative produces an unpleasantly patchy effect of course it may have an educational value if as it should in the present case it sets readers looking him up in the usual sources of information but that we submit is not the function of a novel and if it were it could be more artistically performed why should not the story have centred round the historical richard montgomery instead of the fictitious john a cleeve  any relation by the way to the unlucky walter of the same unusual name who was the unheroic hero of a striking study in a recent volume by mr couch montgomerys career was romantic enough in all conscience and would have afforded no doubt equal opportunity for all the eeo indian and canoe business which mr couch handles so charmingly or for the fighting which he describes as well as it could be done montgomery too one would think must have gone through a crisis of conscience beside which poor johns scruples as to the dispatch which he had unwittingly intercepted would seem a very simple problem as it is richard serves no doubt as something of a foil to john when ono thinks them both out but this aspect will we fear be too subtle for the average reader who likes to have his psychology no doubt but with the ts dotted and the fa crossed we have already to deal with another point hinted that mr couch is of the school of stevenson that is all very well but he is old enough and we believe strong enough to stand alone now sergeant barboux is not alan breck and consequently should not begin his remarks with the word and as another and far more estimable person in the story observes  verbum sapienti satis one other little matter and we have done we doubt if a clive is a possible french name if it existed it would be to be looked for rather in perigord than in quercy and there the preposition would be blended with the body of the word as in the english at names nor is quercy so very far from beam as indeed the people of cahors found out on one famous occasion so there would be nothing strange in a man from that province finding himself in the bearnais regiment  fort amity by a t quillercouch murray 2s 6d net this novel which made its first appearance three years ago has now been reissued in a popular form fort amity  is in its authors usual vein quite light but quite pleasing for the benefit of those who are unfamiliar with the story the outline is briefly as follows the scene opens in canada just before the taking of quebec by wolfe the hero john a cleeve an ensign of the fortysixth regiment of foot is wounded and taken prisoner in the unsuccessful attack on the fort at ticonderoga when wounded he loses consciousness and awakes to find himself in a canoe with other prisoners under the guard of a bullying french sergeant a crippled canadian who acts as steersman and possesses a tenor voice and two indians after many adventures and much guerilla fighting with hostile redskins john is left alone with menewehna the elder of his two indian guards they take shelter with the french garrison of fort amitil where john conceals his nationality passing himself off as a frenchman in the hope of gaining information likely to be of use to his own side here he falls in love with the commandants daughter but his suit seems hopeless as indeed it remains for long we have already been almost unfair to mr quillercouch in giving away so much of his story and it suffices to say that after fifteen years of toil and heartburning the two lovers are at length united,history
new novels i the new june by henry newbolt  blackwood  sons the difficulties in the way of realising a distant historical period have often been remarked but mr newbolt believes that there is very little difference in essentials between modem times and medieval no doubt if we are concerned with fundamental instincts this is true but life is largely a matter of how these instincts are embroidered and exhibited certainly it is rash to assume that the fourteenth century spoke and acted and thought like the twentieth yet mr newbolt makes it do these things his system involves the use of modem colloquialisms such as  before the row begins  in the reign of richard ii this is free translation with a vengeance in his gay preface mr newbolt makes a spirited plea for his method which however hardly convinces us human passions moved these people of richard iis court as they move people today but it does not add verisimilitude to paint them in modem dress any more than it added verisimilitude to the religious pictures of the middle ages that the characters should be invested with contemporary garments apart from this mr newbolts slice from history is astonishingly virile and imaginative it is full of knowledge of the times and mr newbolt claims contains only one invented character of the other characters we may say that they have been handsomely and vividly reinstated if with rather a modem air but the dominant feature of a strongly individual book is its vitality i i i i i  lmovel votes the new june bv henry newbclat 6s blackwood it is not for the reviewer to decide how much truth andl hm much fietion have gone to the making of an hi nt ari rimane mr newbolt tells us lhere in a dediitq rv letter somellilung of his own methods  lhe is restii onc trmin taking liberties with the great figures of lii t r by a feeling that the game iv too eas andi by a pa ht by fredep ock hollyer mr henry newbolt perhaps exaggerated respect for those who have wice lived the life and born thle names of men he writ of the people of the ast not so much to make a stor as to luzzle out a secret  and the roblem which deli hts him is this given certain facts to put together tie life to which thle belonged given a bone or twc to reconstruct the moving breathing organism nee ess to say this is not the way to make a popular histonical novel it mav be even doubted wh lietlher such metlds are essential to thle proluction of good literature iut from the purely historical stanlpoint they are wl llv commendable mr newbolts pictures of the d a of the second richard seenm a little laboured a little lac king in colour lie builds up his organism from that bon or two anl le makes it move but does it breathe and live again and again one wnises mr new bolt would let himiiself g o would ut into his tale something of the rich raw vigour lie has put into his ballads the romance loes not grip it is carefully and excellently written and the story of those two who after grief and danger afnd long searation begin life together at last has all the stuff of great romance in it you read it with immense interest saving how goool it is show sane and balanced in tone how finely finished in style and yet how muchi bigger a thing it might have been had the author beeni one of those careless fellows whlio wcould sooner sacrifice art to life than life to art,history

strange true stones of zoiiaia by george w cve kegan tiltia co all men except a few belated partisans of slavery will be sure to welcome this charming biok from the chronicler of old creole days the work is doubly valuable because mr cable the romancer has suppressed himself so much in order to make room for mr cable the faithful and capable editor the tales in this volume are in one way superior even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed romance have been faithfully translated or preserved whore this firsthand eviience is unattainable the romancer in deposing the editor has nevertheless chosen some true tradition for the groundwork of his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie brouillard the last is the best and the first as decidedly the weakest  salome muller  is loosely and lengthily spun ou end is hardly worthy of so skilled a practitioner as mr cable it also makes too heavy a call upon our interest in the extinct legal luminaries of new orleans fifty years ago too much is said about these phantoms and they are no convincingly reanimated  though the advocate christian roselius deserves his niche for his long duel in behalf of a most injured woman frankly what attracts us most in this and the succeeding stories is less the story itself than mr cables own combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables pencil at its best it must suffice to extract from attalie brouillard a description of the rascal quadroon camille dur our  fancy a small figure thin let us say narrowchested roundshouldered his complexion a dull clay colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own and his linen last weeks it doss not appear whether mr cable has any authority for these traits  but somebody mut surely have sat for such a portrait which we treasure as a bright scrap of reality a living face though it be but a sorry scoundrels saved from oblivion how great i the contrast between this trained portraiture of nature and the remaining four papers where nature herself meets us in all her leisurely process her repetitions her thrilling surprises produced by simple expedients these papers ere all written by women they are translated in three case and abridged in one but otherwise are published intact ajd says the editor without restorations the first bearing the somewhat srevensoniau title of  the young aunt with white hair 13 a translation only seven pages long of a letter written in 1782 by a french emigrie she was seized by indians near the mouth of the mississippi saw ber husband and child dashed down before her eyes wai herself halfflayed at the stake and was only saved from the chiefs dinnertable by a rescuing patty at the eleventh hour the language of the letter is naif and desperate and is in strong contract to mr cables own ornamental and sometimes laboured style it is only a pity that sa little could be printed of the french originals for the sake of their illspelt cager utterance the translations in most cases read well save that mr cable either in order to flavour his diction or from a mistaken idea of translators fidelity sometimes renders french too literally for instance abner did not sparc of beautiful presents   and again the sentence  these

antislavery convictions independently while ever body round her was discharging infinite and furious rant against the slve and his liberators she suffered much from her friends but she kept the faith

she meets discomfort and danger in the detested cause few diaries exhibit such boundless pluck and few such unconsciousness of being at all exceptional it is not till the last page that we learn incidentally how all through the dangerous journey and the siege this brave woman had been nearing her confinement and that the child as might be expected died when it came a reading of this journal might be recommended to those who aro for ever preaching the ennobling and awakening effects of war such may be the effect upon the side that is in the right but how of the wrng side is that ennobled the truth appears to be that people who in private life are just and humane often simply have the sleeping brute and maniac in their composition awakened at the sound of cannon all the more deserving

heathcote of gangoil harry harry hcathcotc of gangoil a tale of australian bush lift by anthony trollope low and co this novel of mr trollopes possesses the double merit of being short and extremely interesting but ws should think lbe would have encountered some difficulty if he had tried to get it published under the auspices of an emigration agency it professes to give a faithful picture of the society of the queensland  bush and of the struggle for existence among the various members of that society which although limited is still sufficiently   ci a naynniqt1ie interests the five drin large to contain antagonistic interests the five principal elements that take an active part in mr trollopes story are squatters freeselectors hired workmen thieves and mosquitos of these the mosquitos are the only animated creatures that seem thoroughly to enjoy life next to them come the thieves whose policy it seems to be to squat on a small leasehold property and to make that a basis of operations for stealing the sheep and cattle of their neighbours the danger of detection and imprisonment or hanging is a certain drawback to the charms of this easy life but that is so slight in a thinly peopled country that the squatter whose notions of property are primitive and elementary as those of paleys pigeon might be ideally happy but for his rivals the mosquitos when however we ascend in the scale of queensland society we have a painful illustration of the cares of greatness and of the advantages for happiness possessed by those at the bottom of the ladder as mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,history
the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and

kidnapped being memoirs of the adventures of david balfour in the year 1751 literature by robert louis stevenson cassell  co it seems to be considered necessary that the schoolboy of the period should be supplied with a new story of adventure for every day in the week it also seems to be considered necessary that men of genius should be told off to write themmen who like mr rider haggard and mr stevenson are sorely needed to produce stories for men and women the consequence is that some of the most picturesque and vigorous imaginative writing that has been produced of late years is to be found in such boys books as 4 king solomons mines 4 treasure island and the tale before us we are not sure that this is entirely a fortunate circumstance in novels written for adult readers it is not enough to furnish a rapid succession of brilliant scenes these scenes must be accounted for by that severe logic of the imagination which is as inexorable as the logic of the schools but in stories written for boys the action moves in entire freedom from those conditions which are at once the trammel and the strength of true art hence in fictive art no boys story can hold a very high place no matter how powerful may be the imagination informing it perhaps we had better give an illustration of our meaning when the writer of a boys story wants as in king solomons mines to bhow how in a great battle between many thousands of savage combatants two eng lish heroes can display prodigies of strength and valour equal to those of achilles or sigurd and yet come out of the fray unwounded he can without hesitation furnish his heroes with european chainarmour the moment it is requiredfind it stowed away in the armoury of an african tribe who are ignorant of firearms and who like the ancient mexicans and peruvians actually believe the white men to have fallen from the stars and when as in the book before us the writer of a boys story wants to show the superhuman fighting powers of a hero a highland soldier he can depict him fighting and conquering an entire ships crew of reckless desperadoes and fireeaters fighting and conquering them singlehanded save for the aid of a boy who knows not how to handle sword or pistol such incidents as these which are perfectly legitimate in a boys story would be absurd in a story for adults and it is a first principle of criticism that no form of art is very high if it can dispense with the logic of imagination this is seen plainly enough if we compare the prowess of mr stephensons alan breck in the roundhouse with the feats of dandy dinmont in the smugglers cave while in the one case the very charm of the thing lies in its boyish freedom from the restraints of imaginative logic in the other every incident of the contest is explained and accounted for as rigidly as though it were matter of actual history of both  guy mannering  and 4 kidnapped the main action was suggested by the annesley case that marvellous romance of real life which in 4 the wandering heir not even charles read could effectually vulgarise and spoil for future use and no doubt it may be said that the true story of young annesley is crowded with adventures more wonderful and exploits more incredible than those to be found in  kidnapped no doubt it may be said that in balfours struggle with old ebenezer there is nothing so improbable as the real struggle of annesley with his wicked uncle and that annesleys adventures in the plantations the fight between the iroquois girl and the slaveowners daughter for possession of the slave annesleys escape from the indian girls brothers and his subsequent more astonishing escape from the gallows at chester as an unconscious accomplice in an elopement surpass in wonderfulness any of the chances escapes and disasters that befell balfour but the saying that  truth is stranger than fiction has an artistic as well as a moral application fiction dares not be so strange as truth save in a boys story where strangeness and exaggeration are it seems not only tolerated but demanded but after the fight in the roundhouse 4 kidnapped passes as we are going to show into a new artistic phasethe phase of true art where no exaggeration and no artistic insincerity can have a place unlike annesley and unlike young ellangowan mr stevensons hero is not carried abroad after all and here perhaps the book as a story attractive to boys will be found to fall behind  treasure island and 4 king solomons mines what boys love above everything else is new scenery and to baulk the expectation of the scenery of wonderland aroused by the opening chapters of this story is exceedingly dangerous having tasted the delight of 4 treasure island and  king solomons mines the boy reader who follows david balfours adventures up to the point of his landing at mull will most likely be disappointed at finding that he is not to be taken to the plantations and yet as has been just indicated it is here where the story passes into literature as a picture of the state of scotland immediately after 1745 we do not hesitate to say that there is nothing in history and nothing in fiction equal to these remarkable chapters it is not only as vivid as a wordpicture by carb lyle it is true and always true as a pici ture by carlyle is false and always false when the hero has left the ship and the i kidnapping scheme is entirely frustrated and not till then we come upon such really vital really organic work as mr stevenson has never given us in his stories for adults such as 4 prince otto 4the new arabian nights and the striking novelette in the court and society review called 4 olalla while the adventures in connexion with though wicked uncle though unquestionably vigorous are excogitated the adventures in the highlands are imagined and this makes us think that it was merely in order to bring in these latter adventures that the somewhat stale business of the kidnapping was resorted to for it should always be remembered in criticising fiction that in the mind of every true storyteller the story passes through two stages the stage when the group of situations is conceived or as we say  invented and the stage when they are really imagined when the inventors mind has become as familiar with them as though he had actually lived in them not till it has reached the latter i stage can imaginative work in any art become vital and so to speak organic this  is why the dramatic work of the novel of ingenious plot is almost always excogitated while that of stories allowed to grow chapter by chapter like the best of scotts is imagined this is why in short there is more imagination in a single page of 4 the antiquary than in an entire story by gaboriau scott though a hasty writer does not as gaboriau does depict a scene because a mechanically constructed plot has forced him to do so but because the scene suggested to him originally by some local anecdote or by some chapter of historyhas lain in his mind for so long a time that all the imaginative energy at his command is called up as soon as he begins to write about it in other words the plot grows out of the scenes the scenes do not grow out of the plot hence in the deepest and truest sense scott often called the most improvisatorial is the least improvisatorial of writers 4 monte cristo furnishes the most striking illustration of what we mean those portions of the romance which precede the working out of the revenge are imagined while those portions which deal with the revenge are excogitated why the latter portions were written first before the story had taken root in the novelists imagination the portions dealing with the imprisonment and the finding of the treasure were written after the story had taken root originally the narrative began with the adventures of the count in italy when he wae plotting his revenge the earlier portions of the work as we now have it were rapidly glanced at for working purposes by way of retrospective dialogue but maquet in talking over the story with dumas suggested that by this method of structure the finest chances afforded by the plot were missed and advised that the narrative should begin not in italy with the revenge but in marseilles with the conspiracy the imprisonment and the finding of the treasure dumas acted upon this and found that thanks to his previous work upon the materials his imagination was now able to live in the situations startling and romantic as they were though as a rule the strength of dumas lies in invention rather than in imagination now of  kidnapped the highland portions alone are imagined hence we cannot but think that for these portions the entire story such as it is was invented a story which simply tells how a manly young hero of the old type struggles with an uncleusurper of the old type and after many adventures and hairbreadth escapes by sea and landadventures and escapes having nothing to do with any proper peripeteiacomes into his own through the good offices of providence and the conventional stage lawyer of the latinquoting type in the highland portions the imagination is of an exceedingly high and rare kind the scenes are flashed not only upon the mental vision but upon the actual senses of the reader and even in the earlier chapters where there is but little imagination in this narrow sense we come across single touches where there is imagination but then it leaps up in a short sudden dazzling flame as where the cry forced from the murderous uncle by superstitious terror is likened in sound to a sheeps bleat in the perfect the ideal storyteller imagination and invention would of course be found in equipoise until recent years the word imagination had a meaning so wide that it included both fancy and invention hence our remarks may not be generally intelligible it seems strange that coleridge was the earliest critic who gave that special meaning to the word  fancy  which it now owns but even now invention and imagination are often confounded critics are apt to use the two words as loosely as did the critics of the eighteenth century as loosely for instance as did alexander pope in his remarks upon the invention in the homeric poems the truth is however as we have before pointed out when writing of homer that it is these very same homeric poems which above everything else in literature alford striking examples of the deep distinction between the inventive and imaginative faculties and it is certainly very singular that those wicked homeric critics who in our own time represent the ancient chorizontes and arouse the wrath of mr andrew lang have never brought forward the strongest of all arguments in favour of the separate authorship of the iliad and the odysseythe argument that while the odyssey shows a very wonderful power of primary invention the iliad shows almost none at all and that while in the odyssey imagination though powerfully active is always ready to yield to invention in the iliad the imaginative force is as unyielding to all demands of invention whether primary or accessory as shakespeares own perhaps however could we pursue the subject here we should find the most remarkable instance of the difference between an imaginative and an inventive poet to be furnished by the cases of shakespeare and spenser but we are concerned at the present moment with prose fiction alone and charlotte bronte affords us an example of a writer in whom the imaginative faculty was very great but whose inventive faculty scarcely existed at all after the professor was rejected on account of deficiency of plotinterest she set to work to construct a plot of the sensational kind and gave us the ugly old situation of a maniac hidden away in a country house the entire plot showing how the lowood governess narrowly escaped committing bigamy with her master whose mad wife was secretly imprisoned at fieldhead was as poor and banal as that of any of those4 shilling dreadfuls that add to the horrors of the railway stations and seem just now to threaten the very existence of prose fiction and yet  jane eyre stands at the top of english romances for sheer imaginative strength on the other hand a writer like the author of 4 called back while showing a very considerable power of invention seems to have been absolutely without the imaginative facultythat faculty which is seen at work in the story before us and entitles it to the attention it is now receiving from us the humorous portions of 4 kidnapped are of a very high order the musical contest between robin oig and alan breck is to be ranked with the finest humorous scenes of scott alan breck is a great success and the hero davie balfour really lives and breathes that he is a landsman to the very marrow is well indicated by his mistaking a tidal islet for a real robinson crusoe island but it is difficult to imagine the veriest landlubber p 122 gazing at the sea from a lonely land saying that it strikes the soul  with a kind of fear on the contrary it is from a ghostly flat or a range of spectral cliffs that the sight of the sea seems to drive away the superstitious terrors conjured up by some landscapes amid superstitious dreads on the loneliest coast on the dimmest night a sense of companionship comes with the smell of seaweed,history
a monk of fife by andrew lang long mans  co it is the weakness of every historical romance that one knows beforehand the inevitable endso far that is as history is concerned even in twenty years after the musketeers can never one feels conscious effect the rescue of charles i and similarly in the penultimate chapter of a monk of fife one foresees with regret that normans brave effort to save the maid of orleans can result only in failure the regret none the less is there and attests the truth and vigour of this storya story that could fitly be written by a scot but not for sheer shame by an englishman whose forefathers might have helped to burn the maid it is a story worthy of its theme there is nothing in it of that overelaboration of style which mars so many of our recent novels no it is simple and quaint and beautiful like a stainedglass window in some old english church the norman leslie who as an old monk writes the chronicle is a young scholar of st andrews a good golfer and something withal of a painter forced by a misadventure to flee to france he takes service with joan of arc and is in her company from her beginning even until her end there are others of course  the villainous cordelier brother thomas elliot hume the sweet scottish maiden whom we like well the little jackanapes whom we like almost better and many moreand the whole book is instinct with life and passion and tenderness at two points and two points only do we cavil whether a native of fife who had lived for the most part abroad would be likely to speak of the  corries of the north and whether brother thomas who had  forgotten his clergy who could not read would ever have been promoted to say mass before the french king indeed that promotion vexes us we like in a novel to have the archtraitor punished the pictures by selwyn image go admirably with the narrative  a monk of fife we doubt whether mr langs interest in romantic literature and his conceivable ambition to be among its purveyors are enough to account for the writing of  a monk of fife as you read you feel it is a pious act the dedication of power and learning to the service of one who has struck his imagination with singular force and enlisted for the glorification of her memory all the ardour of his nature he has written as men used to paint pictures in a believing age his story of the maid especially in its central incidents follows likewise something of the conventions that were long observed in ecclesiastical art a high spiritual subject cannot be duly perceived realistically and not by all if described in the tongue of our common thoughts a thing apart has a language apart and for the language apart he has chosen the language of an earlier day this hampers a man for most purposes but sometimes a right instinct guides to its adoption as here it has preserved for his less imaginative readers at least the remote glory of jeanne his jeanne is the fair saint of some mystical glasspainter or some pious tapestry artist not the peasant jeanne whose uncouth yet spiritual beauty has been pathetically rendered by bastien lepage the same instinct has produced the drawings of mr selwyn image but in them convention has entirely ignored beauty those who are familiar with mr langs free quick witty everyday style will be astonished at the exquisite careful mosaic here with its bright colour and its glittering fragments of gold all wrought with a strict recognition of the limits of the art everything is lucid save the mysterious glamour of the maid sometimes the figures are seen black and clearly lined as against a yellow sunset sky sometimes richly coloured with the sun of midday streaming through them there is hardly a line too much anywhere a tribute should be paid to the learning of the bookand learning is no such superfluity in a historical romance as is commonly supposed the great historical novelists have all written out of a full and intimate knowledge of the highroads and the byeways of the time they were representing never finding a crowded memory choke their invention we have named in the first place the surprising and beautiful art of the book because it sets it in a place apart and then its evidence of zealous research which has added greatly to our clear realisation of an epoch because these are its two chief distinctions but as a story it takes a high place too we went back by the way to read passages over again for our pleasure but we have seen others hurrying to the end carried on by the narrative by the fortunes good and bad of norman

the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,history

the lion of janina or the last days of the janissaries translations by maurice jdkai translated by r nisbet bain jarrold  sons  mr nisbet bain has made himself on this as on other occasions the spokesman of the prolific hungarian novelist in an introduction forgetful of the sound maxim that good wine needs no bush he speaks of various works of his author as the great historical romance  the still more famous novel of manners c but the present work even if it has some merit as a vigorous and picturesque narrative shows m jdkais limitations he has no power of character drawing and his studies of life are crude it is a tale of wild adventure something after the fashion of harrison ainsworth there is plenty of bloodshed  in fact to quote byrons line au stab and everybody dies the hero is ali the sanguinary pasha of janina m jdkai has given a fanciful picture of the splendours of his palace such a description is hardly born out by the accounts of travellers it seems to have exhibited the same contrasts of dirt and magnificence as the majority of seraglios did at that time see such books as the  life of ali pasha london 1823 the turcophile sympathies of the novelist have made him assign nearly all the vices to the christians he wants to create a conventional turk like the conventional red indian of fenimore coopers novels the story of the death of ali is told far better in finlays history of the greek revolution ii 116 the version there is more correct than that of m j6kai and infinitely more picturesque for the ghastly story of the exhibition of the pashas head we must go to the travels of walsh london 1829 who was at constantinople at the time when it arrived duly pickled against the  bones of horribly tortured turks in m jdkais story may be set such facts as the impalement of greek women and boys before missolonghi by reshid pasha the narrative is closed with an account of the murder of the janissaries mahmoud is quite a hero with our author on one page he is described as a handsome man  but unless the portrait in the luxembourg belies him he was very much the reverse aud so this rollicking story of murder and amorous adventure comes to a close the translation is fairly spirited and accurate but here and there we come upon a strange slip thus the name ypsilanti is spelled yprilanti if we had seen this error only once we should have assumed it to be a misprint but it occurs several times and surely whoever writes of this period ought not to be ignorant of the name of the famous instigator of the greek revolution a list of turkish words with their explanations is given at the end but the spelling of them is inconsistent thus we have the forms dzhin and jerid which begin with the same letter in that language  and the orthography ciaits hardly expresses the pronunciation of the word,history
the white terror and the red by a cahan hodder and stoughton 6s novels dealing with what is now called the russian reform movement formerly known as nihilism are almost as the stars in multitude but they fall into two main divisions the one includes the works of those writers who take aristotles insistence on the plot as a command to multiply startling episodes and who seek to obtain the requisite atmosphere by the crude application of local colour it would be invidious to specify their style with more detail the present work is not of this class although neither incident nor local colour is by any means wanting although it shares with most russian novels which we have read a strange formlessness of plot the picture which it paints of social life in russia is drawn from the inside  in opening the book we feel at once that we are in the company of one who knows the aspirations of the russian people and the methods which are now being employed to realise them mr cahan traces the mental growth of prince boulatoff from his childhood when he is a thoughtless champion of autocracy till he is hand in glove with the reformers his book is like many russian novels a rather breathless story of intrigue tempered with dynamite a mass of figures pass across the stage and with the exception of pavel boulatoff and the heroine clara they are rather colourless the individual as it were is in the background and the cause is everything mr cahan we believe thus faithfully reflects at once the strength and the weakness of the cause of reform in russia the types of reformers who play their parts in his pages are so engrossed in setting the cause above renown that they seem paralysed into intellectual inaction the novel in fact like russia herself seems waiting for a leader but it is none the less an engrossing story and may be safely recommended to those who wish to study without undue application the russian history which is being made today one does not expect optimism in a russian novelist mr cahan is not even cheerful again russian fiction is not usually conspicuous for happy endings or the workings of poetic justice the siccum lumen of realism gives so gloomy an atmosphere tp mr cahans pages that he is constrained to end on a note of despair this in fact is not a novel for the ordinary subscriber to a circulating library although the intelligent reader will find in it much sound workmanship and no little insight into the psychology of the russian inlellectuels  the twhite terror and the red b i a cahan hodder  stoughton this is a  novel of revolutionary russia in which the white terror of the throne is brought face to face with the red terror of nihilism the author appears to have a grasp of his subject and is evidently an enthusiast in the cause of the people but the style has a curious impenetrability about it which reminds one of a bad translation such sentences occur as rising in the background was the hostess lydia grigorievna chertogova chertogoff and her gorgeous crutches while  upward tending frank features and luxurious side whiskers  distinguish the male characters the story opens dramatically enough with the conversion of the hero prince pavel boulatoff to the cause of russian reform and since this is partly due to the influence of a fair jewess we have all the elements of a successful romance but as the action proceeds it becomes too involved conspirators persecuted jews revolutionists of every type throng the stage and we find it difficult to obtain any clear insight into their proceedings especially as a bewildering impalpable mist of style clouds our vision a lucid interval is afforded by the assassination of alexander ii vividly described then the medley begins again asterisks stud the pages in rows and the heros fate is finally left in suspense it is a book of contrasts from the title to the end,history
  sister louise sister louise or thc story of a womans repentance by g j why temelville london  chapman and hall it is pleasant to be disappointed in a book that opens in the most approved style of the historical novel with a dialogue between two soldier friends in the low countries two hundred years ago  who call each other comrade dash dowtn a plumed hat toss oft a stoup of wine and have a faroff memory in their deep grey eyes and for this reason because the vividness of the local colouring though safety in the application of it and the tinsel of the dummy royalties that crowd the canvas make a novel whose scene is remote in time and country the citadel of ignorant and shallow writers and though fools paradise of those vacuous gapers who must have blazonry and bunting even in what they read and so  i faith and  byre ladye  do duty for dialogue  and a surface of pomp and circumstance ostentation and affectation pass themselves off as the workings of human nature on that large class who have either never felt or never analysed their feelings but when an author who has some instinctive insight into though machinery of thc heart and who writes besides with that  easy grace and selfrestrained strength which is the sure token of a gentleman of culture and a man of the world selects a certain century to frame his picture in it is the picture and not the frame that we observe and his manipulation of accessories that are unfamiliar to us makes us either admire his skill the more or possibly regret that the strangeness of the surroundings distracts and distorts our view of the characters conspicuous instances of this are  romola and those novels of scott which are chiefly historical surely it is always in spite of and not because of their pecuharity that we praise those books and it is because in  sister louise an honest development of characters wrought with no little skill and delicacy outshines its setting of upholstering gorgeousness that we say it is a good book worth writing and worth reading an outline of the story is briefly this louise de la valliere and athenee de mortemar are two girls well born and straitly bred who become maids of honour at the court of the youthful and beautiful louis quatorze with the strictest propriety wre are told how they both of them ceased in any sense of the word to deserve that designation louise has a devoted lover the marquis de bragelone he of the faroff eyes athenee has a dashing admirer henri le blanc the brother of louise and these two gentlemen complicate themselves in fruitless rivalry with the king to whose attractions both ladies but for different reasons succumb each retiring at the close of his reignlouise to the selftormenting repentance of a convent where she dies and athenee to the seclusion of displacement and disgust where she passes from our view  and the widow scarron madame de maintenon reigns in her stead the person and character of the heroine louise are carefully and we should imagine truly drawn  soft blue eyes and tender quivering mouth delicate rather than regular of features a face of which the primrose is the type among flowers and the pearl among precious stones her figure was well formed and agile though hampered by a limp in afterlife rivals declared she was lame and denied she was beautiful but the very vehemence of their criticism offers its best contradiction    her nature was one of entire selfdevotion totally irrespective of self in striking contrast to her stands out the saucy and unscrupulous athenee who loves the king designedly and not because she cannot help it supplants her early friend jilts her first lover is worldly to the backbone and yet not without shallow qualms of temporary contrition nor without that intermittent breath of a better affection which blows hot and cold in so many shallow women there is great sameness in love affairs says this roue of twenty one man pleases more than another and that is all and so for a vantageground she marries the rich monsieur de montespan and keeps a line to hold her former lover weaving her net round the king all the while louise on the other hand is a tender and true woman all sensitiveness and selfabnegation  every sense and instinct of nature and romance held in thrall by youthful kinghood and worshipping with idolatry a thoroughly selfish man  simply because something must be offered up there is something very touching in the story of her love and how it slowly palls upon the king and how she falls from disappointment to despair till remorse and a broken heart beat themselves away in an ascetic infatuation and the king the petted and pampered the favourite of gods and men following his better instincts in trying to love her notwithstanding the boredom which grows upon him all the more because of her utter resignation of all her personality to him he too is painted with truth and not without force but there is an uneasiness about any character that is half fact and half fiction still it is work worthy of an artist to trace the course of such a love as his  whose gradations are slow and sure custom indifference weariness and neglect he is princely according to the popular idea of kinghood in magnificence in assumption of omnipotence in graceful treading on the necks of men  he wages battle under the eyes of ladies and in full dress but indeed it is not so difficult to draw something that will pass muster for a character if you put it on a pedestal saying  this is a great king and the millinery is a la louis quatorze to reveal what detail of plot there is would be hardly fair for there is very little and the book does not depend upon its plot and is all the more readable for the simplicity of it the description of the hunt is good or it would not have been written by the author of  katerfelto the conversations are terse and witty and smack very strongly of the french the opening scene in the low countries is superfluous  and the whole of the last book which is an enlargement on the penances of  louise de la misericorde might have been curtailed with advantage but even as it is the story is commendably short nor is there a weak sentence throughout nor one that jars upon the taste even the magnificence is not tawdrily described the book is natural notwithstanding its setting and is obviously written by a gentleman the sentences are occasionally very long but they never seem longwinded it is true that we meet with many familiar commonplaces in an elegant disguise and that many a harmless sentiment stalks by us with an unwonted dignity but it is none the less a pleasure and not a common one to meet with a story not very long and not very pretentious temperately and smoothly told where there is nothing of strain or vulgarity or rant no stilts and no crimes except adultery  no horrors and no vapours of course there is much that might be quarrelled with is it true as is here laid down that when a man and a woman carry a sorrow between them the man displays and the woman feels it the most  is it true that there is a sinking of the heart which never deceives and is surely followed by evil  it is rather that the shadow of the present throws itself back into the past but assertions like these not being written by one of the great masters of mental analysis are harmless enough and were possibly not intended as deliberate conclusions on the other hand the book abounds in aphorisms and epigrammatic bits of description here is one which if it is original is too good not to be

  deborah  a tale of the times of judas maccabeus by james m ludlow nisbet the struggle between antiochus epiphanes and the sons of mattathias in which the cruelty and sensuality of the greeks were opposed and overcome by the intense devotion of the jews to their faith would seem to offer a promising subject for an historical romance if mr ludlow has not made so much of it as might have been expected the reason is that he is better fitted to be a descriptive than a romantic historian he can represent a scene describe a pageant or a sacrifice or the course of a battle with spirit and reality in one case at least his attention to detail has produced a picture which is we think unnecessarily revolting the story though interesting enough in itself limps heavily along under a commonplace style and there is little life in the characters some of these like judas and his brothers king antiochus and the priest menelaos are historical persons of the rest deborah a jewish joan of arc and dion a chivalrous greek captain who turns out to be no greek after all make a rather colourless pair of lovers in spite of many stirring adventures,history
new novels blue and green or the gift of god by sir henry pottinger in three volumes chapman  hall vixen by thc author of  lady audleys secret in three volumes j  r maxwell marco visconti translated from the italian by a d in three volumes charing cross publishing company my friend and my wife by henry james gibbs in three volumes s tinsley co sir henry pottinger has undertaken one of the most difficult of literary tasks in the book before us further described on the titlepage as  a romance of old constantinoplenamely that of writing an historical novel which shall make a fardistant and quite unfamiliar past live again and interest the modern reader and as we have had occasion to remark before the exceptional brilliancy of charles kingsleys hypatia has made success of this kind much less easy of attainment than ever it is doing sir henry pottinger no more than justice to say that his romance is the best of the kind which has appeared since hypatia and if it fall short of that work in any respect it is from no lack of ability culture and diligence but merely because all these qualities united are necessarily unequal to the imaginative insight of a poet the topic he has chosen is the strange and eventful history of justinian and theodora while the  blue and green  of the chief title has reference to the rival factions of the hippodrome the veneti and prasini whose competition in politics and theology was one of the greatest dangers to social order in the sixth century the author declares that one of his aims has been to rehabilitate theodoras character at any rate as regards the latter part of her life and notably in her conjugal relations with justinian and to maintain the thesis that not only was she however degraded in her theatrical days more sinned against than sinning even then but that she is a real instance of genuine repentance amendment and purification in her whole subsequent conduct it is known of course by all scholars that the horrible profligacy attributed to her almost unparalleled even in the annals of hetaerism rests entirely on the anecdotes in the  secret history  of procopius to which sir henry pottinger declines to accord any credit herein he is supported by the judgement of the late dean milman who brands it as  the basest and most disgraceful work in literature and as a  virulent libel whose insincerity is proved by its direct contradictions to its authors other published writings on the whole the history of the time has been carefully studied and adhered to and its most famous personagesjustinian and theodora themselves john of cappadocia hypatius belisarius and antonina ecebolus the tyrianare represented on the canvas the author has selected his episodes with much judgment and has allowed himself but few liberties with the chronicles which supply him with the materials for his narrative the most serious beinghis assignment of the first infatuation of justinian for theodora to the very beginning of her career just before her appeal as an orphan suppliant to the generosity of the factions instead of to the date of her return from africa after disappearing from constantinople in company with ecebolus and the softening of the reverses experienced by belisarius in the persian and arabian war and the only important anachronism is that he represents both anastatius aud justinian as specifically claiming merely the empire of the east whereas the fact is that the western empire was finally extinguished early in the reign of zeno about eighteen years before justinian was even born so that the rulers of constantinople claimed the obedience of the west as sole emperors until long after their carolling rivals had taken their places in gaul and italy the third volume of blue and green albeit containing a vivid description of the famous  nika revolt of the factions is less successful than its predecessors perhaps from being less of a romance and more of a summarised history but partly no doubt because fidelity to truth obliges the author to acknowledge how far his hero and heroine fell below the promise of their opening reignhow theodora substituted the vices of greed vindictiveness and cruelty for those of ber former career and how justinian did not exercise his great qualities impartially for the good of his subjects but was their fiscal oppressor without being their defender against either foreign war or domestic turbulence his likeness to louis xiv in wars building and theological fanaticism and also in the manner in which he impressed the imaginations of those brought into contact with him is a curious historical parallel which has not received the attention it deserves and which has escaped our present authors notice in the scholarly preface of his interesting book vixen is a story in miss braddons later and better manner put together with but a small stock of incidents and yet vivid and readable with tokens of real hard work cropping out every now and then to show that the author does not rest on her natural facility of invention and diction nor yet on her established popularity as an excuse for ceasing to take pains and to lay in continually fresh supplies of reading for illustrative purposes the little bits of learning arc not always quite accurate and are sometimes rather dragged in than brought in but there is nothing visible of the audacious blundering in all departments of knowledge which gives such a ludicrous colour to the novels of some of her lady competitors the present story is almost entirely restricted to the new forest save for one transfer of scene to jersey and miss braddon writes of the charming woodland scenery of hampshire with evident local knowledge and strong personal interest her heroine a generous spoiled child of quick temper is very cleverly sketched and not overdrawn and the manly commonplace hero with no bookish tastes but not in the least guy livingstonish is also a good portrait though here and there his remarks are not too shrewd but a little too cultured to be quite in keeping we recognise him better when remarking of a room newly doneup in the very last south kensington highart style with high chocolate dado all round that it looks as if they had run short of wallpaper than when quoting tennyson or using scraps of french there is humour too in a gentleman carrying off his ladyloves unreadable browningesque verses and handing them over to his private secretary to digest analyse and comment on and then coming out with the criticism at first hand and making all the running in consequence and there is judgement in not overdoing the objectionable stepfather in the story when it would have been easy to represent him as illusing the wife whoso fortune alone he sought and squandering her income whereas his selfishness is more enlightened and more natural as actually depicted vixen is not one of those books which either make or mar a reputation  but it is pleasantly readabe and as we have said shows tokens of honest pains spent in making it so marco visconti is simply tommaso grossis wellknown historical novel in an english dress grossi followed manzoni whom he acknowledged as his master much as g p r james followed walter scott and truth to say at very much the same distance the book enjoys a considerable reputation in italy whose literature is not even yet rich in historical novels though it possesses a few notable ones  but if manzoni had written more grossi would be less esteemed the era of the story is the stirring midst of though fourteenth century when the famous warrior who gives it his name was a very remarkable figure not unlike henry of guise two hundred years later and grossi has taken great pains to work contemporary history into his plot as well as to give his readers graphic scenes from the daily life of the period among which the riot in a church between the partisans of the rival popes is perhaps the most vivid but the story is thin and poor with personages of little interest and the reader remains quite unaffected by the tragedy which is intended to move though very depths of his nature to pity and regret the consciousness that they are mere layfigures in a costume painting never dies out and while we look with appreciation on the happy rendering of this breastplate and that beaker the human figures attract little observation the translation is well done and rarely shows the influence of foreign idioms while there are some very respectable renderings of the verses which grossi intercalated in his narrative my friend and my wire is a crude book with a few occasional patches of merit but on the whole is rather hard reading the writer does not seem to have got his scheme clearly before him and gets rather  mixed  in consequence take the title for example lt clearly denotes that the book is autobiographical and thc persons named in it the belongings of thc writer but when we come to the story itself it purports to be a narrative written by the heros tutor who is the 41 i of the story but who is not married at all so that the second  my of thc titlepage if not the first also applies to though hero and ought to be  his  so again it is not easy to make out the chronology lt is after sir robert peels death which was in 150 and before pimlico was built at least ten years earlier it is before the establishment of competitive examinations in the civil service and after the movement for the sanitary reform of j london courts nor is the tale better managed though hero is cast off by his father a rich manufacturer for refusing to bribe the officials who have though bestowal of government contracts and comes to great straits in consequence but ho has married the only and beloved child of a wealthy canon who does not quarrel with his daughter because of her choice and yet no penny of her fortune comes to them nor does she ever think of applying to her father for help though she does so to her brotherinlaw and whereas though heros bosomfriend seduces though wife and actually elopes with her being barely stopped in time by the opportune arrival on the scene of the seducers uncle a fine old french abbe the pair come home again and return to the old domestic footiug of intimate acquaintanceship as if nothing had happened to be sure the gay lothario goes ott as a missionary to africa after a while but that is a later arrangement there are as we have said occasional scraps of better quality here and there in the story and the writer can sometimes sketch a single scene or situation fairly enough but he has neither constructive skill nor staying power and the best thing in the narrative is the character of the heros younger brother always full of the noblest sentiments but weak selfdeceiving and egoistic yielding to every temptation from lack of moral fibre and spreading ruin round him as surely as if from deliberate villanv r f littledale,history

mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and his only child to explain their views and positions  papa

satirise you dreadfullywell if we are going io live in new boston why cant we keep house  this extract gives a good idea of the pleasant natural style in which the book is written the doctor is a most delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy matters i mst confess sid the doctor resuming his seat that this is a most attractive and flattering proposition i am vain enough to believe that i could be of use to this poor ignorantbrutish downtrodden insulted plundered race of pariahs and helots if i could orgaise negro labour in louisiana on a basis jut and profitable to all partieishould consider myself more honoured than by being made president of the united ates in ordinary times if i could be the means of educating their darkened minds and consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his child how tender is his care for her how devoted his attachment i how pleasant and how playful his manner yet always so full of sympathy and wathful love  he and colbourn the volunteer captain are both made superior to ordinary mortals they can be hardhearted to themselves but they are always tenderhearted to their neighbours the cut the burden of their own troubles and griefs behind their backs that they may sympathies with those of their friends the virtues of the parent ae reflected in his child lmeli is the worthy daughter of such a father the gaiety of her temper is the charucteristic which chiefly charms the reder the personal beauty which exercises so potent a spell over all with whom she has to do cannot really afford any particular pleasure to one who only reads of it beauty must be seen to be appreciated there is but small satisfaction in hearing of a beauty one is never likely to se but as we road we csot help feeling the pleasant hw lp di har iature and

vividly the enn and tediousn of life in camp the restraint of discipline and the frequent negligenes of volunteers the reckless rush of some to the charge whilst others are skulking behind the terrors of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special qualification we have on our table thc epistle

lrovel votes the historical nights entertainment seric 11 by rafiwl stabtini liuttchinson the embellishment of the dry facts of history with fictitiolis episoles anl speeches whichlli could not have been reportel to the historian is as old a practice as the writing of history itself but it has leen left to the moderns to introduce realism tlhe use of fiction as a vehicle for the expression of historical facts has reachled a high stage of perfection the novel has not the limitations of the drama and afloris an anmpler scope for the exploration of the 1wvans and less important episocles of the main story it was sir walter scott who showed the possibilities of history as the groundwork of the novel and mr rafael sabatini has shown us how successfully history ma be adapted to the short story his conscientiousness is apparent from his introlcltion in which hie is at pains to indicate where anl to uwhat extent lhe has stray ed beyond the limits of strict historical truth and it is amazing to find how little his art has obliged him to stray there is of course individual interpretation of definite episodesas for example the manner of the death of amy robsart in which he differs considerably from scotts storvbut no departure from the basis of historical fact seems necessary we are inclined to favour in this series the stories which deal with english subjects the barren wooing in which the description of le chuadra the spanish ambassador is excellently givenand the noble licttlres of sir walter ralegh and lord clarendon in sir judas  and  the ipath of exile  respectively mr sabatini is an authority on torquemada so it is perhaps temernirious to question his description in  the hermosa femlra  of the grand inquisitor more especially as he draws attention to this in his introduction but it would seem that of all the characters portrayed this one alone appears overdrawn and unreal the most dramatic story is perhaps the first one which the author admits to be entirely apocryphal the treatment of charlotte corday in  the tvrannicid e  is exquisite in its tenderness and delicacv these stories have a wide appeal and their usefulness as a means of arousing interest in what otlherwise might seem dryasdust facts cannot be exaggerated it is to be hoped that mr sabatini will pursue this experiment and go even farther afield for his subjects,history
ezction i d i whilehal or the days of charles the first an historical  romance bytthe author of  mwhitefriars the name of this novel indicates the time and place of the action it will also suggest the leading incidents the latter days of charles offer a fine field for the genius of the novelist but it needs a masterhand to do justice to the themepowers l such as the father of historical romance could alone have brought to the task to say of the author of whitehall that he has not entirely succeeded in his ambitious aim is to say of him only that he is not the greatest writer of his age and we frankly admit that it would be unfair to try him by an extraordinary standard compared with his contemporaries he is not inferior to any of theis in some of the qualities requisite for this class of literature he is equal to most of them in the accomplishments necessary for the production of fiction of any kind is descriptive powers are great  he has read up well for the occasion he has keen perceptions of the nicer shades of character and his soul is in his work so that he writes with the flow of a full mind and carries the reader onward by force of a certain energy which is felt although incapable of definition but these excellences are mingled with manifest faults his composition is often careless and ungraceful his plot is wanting in artistic skill  he resorts too much to the tricks of the novelist relies for his effects upon the unnatural or supernatural mistakes the wonderful for the grand and the melodramatic for the dramatic lie is copious of contrivances for any difficulty but they are so farfetched mo thoroughly beyond the bounds of probability that they offend the readers sense of propriety and often produce a smile where a striking surprise was intended this tendency of the writer to exaggerationthis convulsive straining after effect wau apparent in his previous novel but it has grown with his growth and is still more obvious and more repulsive here another fault he has fallen into in common with many of his predecessors he has been overanxious to press into his pages all the great personages of the time and to bring this about he has resorted to contrivances so out r so wild so out of the natural order of things that the design is made palpable to the reader whose interest in the affair departs the moment he is compelled to feel that all these good people have been brought together to show off the writer and not to ad vance the story it is in the strictly historical portions of the romance that the author excels ihe is skilful in dramatising actual events bringing them before us not as mere dry details of facts but with their accessories of men and manners and dialogues that paint them upon the fancy invested with a human interest and more like things we have seen than such as we have only read of the story begins with the battle of newbury and ends with the death of charles the hero is one ingulph an illegitimate son of the marquis of 0ontaclte a youth of brilliant talent favoured of the queen his brother born in wedlock is betrothed to marie one of the daughters of the earl of strafford but she is loved bv and loves our hero ingulph the jealousies and rivalries of these brothers are the staple of the plot de la pole the legitimates name is the villain of the story he practises all sorts of rascalities against his brother and by false charges has him sent to prison he escapes thence is taken prisoner by prince rlpert goes to london and meets imilton waller and other famous personages and is invited to join the plot of the latter failing in this de la pole accuses him of crimes of which he was the real author and almost succeeds when cromwell comes in time to save him takes him into his service patronizes and promotes him this takes him into the battle of naseby  he is entrusted with the custody of the king is appointed on the commission discovers that he is the kings natural son plots his escape is detected and witnesses his execution nevertheless with all its improbabilities and faults tfhitehall is a better novel than the generality of those that are issued to amuse the dull leisure

of the execution of charles 1 as he spoke the door flew open and axtel rushed abruptly in 4 1 all is well  he exclaimed  lhe is on the scaffold and not a breath is heard against it  l our prayer is answered  exclaimed cromwell leaping up they cannot they dare not they shall not i shouted in 4 gulf desperately but as be rushed forward axtel harrison and the sentinels at the door darted against him and seized him in an overpowering grasp after a vain but furious struggle of some moments he suddenly yielded  i submitall is lost  but let me see him ere he dieslet me but obtain bis forgiveness or my soul is lost for ever  he exclaimed distractedly turning to cromwell who gazed at him for a moment in silence in swear to me that you till attempt no disturbance for i i tell you the guard

now go  for me i will seek the lords will only in praver  and covering his face with his hands he rezumned his kneeling h posture while ingulph closely guarded by axtel left the chamber or rather burst out of it o aware that all further resistance was sheer madness in the serenity of utter despair engulf hastened to the banqueting t hall all the windows were stemmed with gazers many of them sl women in vizards it was crowded with soldiers whose partisans b kept a clear way to the fatal window engulf even afterwards a remembered that he looked vacantly up and noticed the ceiling 13 glowing with all the splendours of the pencil of rubens and ri representing the apotheosis of james i in but the tragedy was not yet consummatedthe coffin was still w t there untenanted engulf hurried on he reached the scaffold th and stood for a moment in a state of dreamy stupefaction the king was on the point of concluding the long and calm is harangue with which he vindicated his conduct on the scaffold i appealing thence to posterity i  i have delivered my conscience he said  i pray god 1s that you do take those courses that are best for the good of the it kingdom and your own salvation 1 juxon then spoke though it be very well known what  your majestys affections are to the protestant religion he said re  yet it may be expected that you should say something for the w worlds satisfaction in that particular  i thank you very heartily my lord for that i had almost it forgotten it replied charles with a slight smile and turning to the people he said in a raised voice in troth sirs my con 3 science in religion i think is very well known to all the world t and therefore i declare before you all that i die a christian t according to the profession of the church of england as i found  it left me by my father and this honest man i think will y witness it he turned again to the officers in attendance and his eye fell l on engulf with an expression of extreme pity

not so  but promise me never again to serve him that truly iscromwell returned the unfortunate monarch ia a low tone but observing that engulf was speechless he stooped embraced him warmly and with a gesture recommended him to the care of axtel while he himself returned calmly to the executioner  i shall say but very short prayers and when i thrust out my handsthe masked executioner nodded with a deep sigh the bishop now handed the king a white satin nightcap but feeling his long grey hair he inquired of the executioner if it would be in his way the man made no reply but laid down his axe and assisted the bishop in adjusting it under the cap  i have a good cause and a gracious god on my side  he said to juxon smilingly when this fearful preparation was completed there is but one stage more replied juxon which though turbulent and troublesome yet it is a very short one you may consider it will soon carry you a very great wayit will carry you from earth to heaven and there you will find to your great joy the prize you hasten toa crown of glory 1  i go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown where no disturbance can be no disturbance in the world said charles mournfully as if retracing in his mind the turbulent events of his career y you are exchanged from a temporal to an eternal crowna good exchange  replied the bishop  is my hair well  said charles turning to the executioner lie nodded taking off his collar and insignia of the garter the king then handed it to juxoni saying the remarkable and ominous word which has ever since puzzled posterity remember  charles glanced at the block and the loose staples you must set it fast he observed it is fast sir replied the executioner charles looked at him for a moment but the impenetrable mask baffled his scrutiny knight of de la pole  he then said in a low tone  it might have been a little higher  it can be no higher sir said the assistant executioner observing that his master made no reply by this time axtel surprised at dethewarres making no effort to rise from his kneeling position shook him violently and startled him from a kind of insensibility rather of mind than body he arose and mechanically obeying the gestures of axtel followed him off the scaffold but as they entered the banqueting hall a low deep universal sigh was heard gradually rising among the mob he glanced backan axe arose gleaming in a wintery sunbeam which shone out for an instant and fell with the same vast and universal sigh accompanying its fall the object of so many loves and hates a moment before

the battleground by ellen glasgow constable gs the war letween north and south is not an original subject for a novel in the battleground however it is treated so freshly as to make us forget how often we have had to read about it before the hero for one thing is not an abolitionist who loves the daughter of a slaveowner  nor are our sympathies ranged as a matter of course on the side of the slaves indeed thereis a wholesome impartiality about the book which is generally absent from this sort of story and which perhaps owes its existence to the authors sense of humour one of the best instances of this humour occurs in a delightful conversation between a faithful old nigger and his master who has just been thrown into a frenzy by the remarks of an abolitionist neighbour 44 they say ive no right to you congo bless my soul and you were born on my own land  44 go way ole marster who gwine min wat dey say   returned congo soothingly    the major wiped his eyes on the end of the neckerchief as he tied it about his throat 44 but if they elect their president he may send down an army to free you he went on with something like a sob of anger  lawd lawd sah said congo    14 did you ever heah tell er sech doins     don you min ole marster well des loose de dawgs on em dats wat well do  a writer who can infuse humour into the slave question certainly deserves our gratitude  but miss glasgow does not keep hers only for politics lt is absent from hardly a page of the first part of the book which deals with the childhood of most of the characters in it and it is always the right sort of humourthe kind that never lets us forget the pathos that is lurking beneath even when we are reading of the little girl who hates boys  and yet resents being made to  sit against the wall  at a party while her pretty sister is dancing her uncle bill dries her tears for her with an unexpected offer of fifty cents  441 reckon fifty cents will make up for any boy eh   betty lay still and looked up from the floor u ii reckon a dollar might she gasped but humour is not the only quality to be found in the battle  ground there is excellent characterdrawing plenty of genuine human feeling and a really uno description of a battle the story itself rattles along without halting and is well worth reading to the end,history

in binding but wanting in that which alone cannot be imitatedthe spirit of antiquity by which we mean that the author has failed to perform the impracticable feat of transforming himself into a being of a past age and thinking as he would have thought had he lived at the time he is supposed to be writing hence an evident stifiess a conscious unreality that pervade the story and repel from it the readers sympathies it must always lbe so for no man can quite forget all that he has learned which was unknown two centuries ago can altogether lay aside ideas that have been cast in the mould of his own age to assume those that have the impress of another age hence works of this clamss ever have been and ever will be unsuccesful candidates for a wide popularity they want the trutith that is requisite to rouse the sympathies of the many  they are felt by all to be nothing more than curious exercises of the ingenuity and to be wanting in the vigour of originality it is impossible to read them right on and the utmost that is attempted by the most curious admirer of the times that are past is to peruse pages here and there or to dwell upon a few isolated pictures and in which probablv the writers enthusiasm has let him to forget his assumed character and address his readers in his own person viewed thus as a curious effort of ingenuity and a work of considerable antiquarian research these colloqies qf the citizen and clothtworker are certainly amusing in parts but in others somewhat dull tie author is not more successful than others have been in sinking his own

perfect  the colloquies of edward osborne citizen and i clothworker of london as reported by ye author of  mary powell hall  co this is a pleasant little volume relating the fortunes of a london apprentice in the sixteenth century with a tolerable degree of verisimilitude and much naive simplicity the storywe have every reason to believe it to be a true oneof edward osborne the clothworkers  prentice bold who took that perilous leap from the window of his masters house on london bridge and rescued his little daughter who had fallen from thence and whom in after years the gallant youth married has been taken as the basis of the narrative before uswhich details the various incidents chiefly domestic in young osbornes career from the time when his mother and he came up from pleasant ashford leaving the grey horse at the tabard and made their way to master hewets house on the bridge to the year 1559 when having married  sweet mistress anne the fortunate apprentice projects the marvellous pageant which graces his fatherinlaws mayoralty and knighthood the picture of master hewets homely but cheerful household is worked up carefully and on the whole with a fair amount of accuracy and the character of osbornes companions especially the lame weaver tomkins are well drawn anne his masters daughter for whom he takes  the leap that was clear 60 feet into the river without so much as a thought what i should do when i got there is also very prettily drawnhere is a pleasant picture of old london life  yes  those were happy days all the fairer they seem now for the dark ones that were coming the only sorrow among us that i remember was when the pestilence brake out in the oth year of our young king which at first only prevailed in the north but at length reached london where it raged with prodigious fury carrying oft 800 souls the first week and mostly after a sickness of only twelve or twentyfour hours we had it not on the bridge which wa attributed to the free access of fresh air to our dwellings  howbeit mistress anne like a ministering angel as she wassuch a child too  only in her twelfth year  must needs go about relieving poor wretches in their dwellings whereby she caught a low fever that brought her to deaths door and filled the house with tears if my master a man in years forbare not to weep reason was a lad such as i should weep too howbeit through the grace of god she recovered  but for a long time she was too enfeebled to walk wherefore master hewet took her much on the water during the long summer evenings after we had been nigh stiffled by the days sultry heat for the eastern side of the house was close and the western though open yet was much exposed to the glare of the sun on the river we shut it out with blinds and lattices all we could but still the crown ofthe day was after sundown on the water master hewet liked his prentices to pull and sometimes we fell into the wake of some court barge with horns and sackbuts and lay on our oars  mistress anne full silent resting her head for weakness against my masters shoulder and with the tears sometimes stealing down from her large bright eyes my master carried her down to the boat but twas my portion for i will not say burthen to carry her up how light she was she did not much like it and managed present ij to ascend slowly with the help of my masters arm but i remember the goodness and sweetness with which with a sweet blush on her face she sayth  do you remember the first time  but for thee i had not been here now as she strengthened we kept out longer and went up to chelsea and fulham and rambled about the pleasant fields  eating curds and cream at milkhovses and returning by moonlight miles and i singing row the boat norman  master hewet meanwhile  had risen mightily and this year 1553 was made sheriff  well remember i young mistress anne tripping down from her closet in skyblue taffeta and flirting a little featherfen as she passed me crying  make way for the sheriffs daughter oh ned how grand i am  thereof the mayor he was full fain an eke the sheriff also i said sure mistress the sheriff in that song came to no goodi wist not ye had so much pride she looked about on me with her sweet smiling face and said  ive no pride for myself edward but i may have for him may i not  may i not playfully calling after me as i turned away i said oh forsooth mistreis ye can do no wrongis that in jest or earnest  saith she growing serious  am i proud edward when i saw her wistful look and thought within me how much indeed she had to be both proud and vain of jet was neither i could carry it no farther but said  in sooth sweet mistress you are notalls right then cjuod she gaily and hastened to the window to see the new sheriff mount his graj horse richly caparisoned thereafter miles and i attended her and mistress fraunces to the river stairs where the company were to embark on a pleasureparty i thought the barge had a goodly and lovely freight we could well have spared the politics of the following pages and especially all the episode of the fight at the bridgesince we can read that almost verbatim in the chronicle of queen janefor such passages as the above or as the following now mark me hew thus went i on for three whole years nnd neer once lost hold of my stay what man hath done man may do i was not like one working on hope for i had had none given me i say not that i was always born up to highwater mark questionless there were daily ebbs and flows  and ever and anon a mighty powerful rushing wind would come and drive back the current on an heap leaving bare the stony channel till after a while with strong recoil it came hurrying back ready to sweep all before it but i never let go the rope  many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it deep might call hoarsely unto deep but not prevail   speak as if i felt it  why i do  i am an oldish man now at least you think mo not over young  but there are some good and pure feelings lad thou wilt never become dull to so long as thou keepest thy heart with all diligence and the best of it is that whilst those feelings so far as they were pleasant are pleasant still the pains then so bitter that came from keeping down all that was wrong with a strong hand are now pleasures too that are recalled over and over again when maybe we seem cogitating or dozing give me thy hand lad  i see you believe me so did master hewet believe me the story ends as we have said with the splendid doings at sir william hewets inauguration feastand the relator winds up his narrative with a lengthened eulogy on the lord mayors of london and their valiant and charitable deeds which really ought to entitle the author of this pleasant little book to a free admission to every civic banquet during the coming year there are a few inaccuracies which might as well he amended should the work reach a second edition the corkscrew was certainly unknown to citizens in the sixteenth century and the phrase they are quite exploded now at genteel tables could never have been used by mistress fraunces such finical phraseology belongs to the ladies maids of the present day not to the housewife of king edwards we must protest also against the traitors heads which at this period garnished the bridge being compared to  so many plumpuddings prickt on spits the writer who with spasmodic effort after originality compared daisies on the greensward to  miniature eggs on spinage was scarcely guilty of so gross a violation of good taste but we may as well remind the writer that plumpuddings in their old original shape were roll upand in that form like an enormous sausage they are still to be seen in remote parts of the country as the time for this agehallowed dainty is so near approaching perhaps some of our young england readers may thank us for this passing remark and have their puddings as well as their other christmas observances after the strictly orthodox fashion the representation of osbornes mother as  well to do with 200 by the year is also very incorrect at a time when wages of labourers were at the utmost but 87 a day and when even the kings servants thought 20 per annum a handsome remuneration  han3 holbein himself receiving but 30 fixed salary200 a year would have been the income of a lady of almost the highest stationwe have indicated these few errors not in any spirit of captious criticism but because we are well pleased with the book and therefore wish to see it free from errors,history
  novel notes quo vadis by henryk sienkiewicz translated from the polish by jeremiah curtin dent this is a historical novel of the oldfashioned leisurely ample and solid character a kind demanding for such success as is attained here a vast deal more learning and brains than the slighter sort in vogue today wanting too from us rather more patience than we are accustomed to give but its excellent workmanship and the warm humanity which lights it up deserve our close attention and reward it it is a terrible picture of the days of nero and the cruel conflict between the old ideas and the new containing powerful and subtle portraits of the brutal imperial comedian and his court and strange tender glimpses of the fresh life springing up in obscurity and weakness that was to outlast his power and to rule more widely the chief interest in the book is petronius the elegant and the cultivated companion of nero a man who had drunk pleasure to the dregs a passionate lover of sensuous beauty yet not impervious to the influence of holiness as exemplified by the christian ladies pomponia and lygia and with a profound contempt for the bestial depravity of his master but he is never a christian convert am i to love the bithynians who carry my litter the egyptians who heat my bath    in rome there are a hundred thousand persons at least who have either crooked shoulders or big knees or thin thighs or staring eyes or heads that are too large dost thou command me to love these too    whoso loves beauty is unable for that very reason to love deformity one may not believe in our gods but it is possible to love them as phidias praxiteles miron scopias and lysias loved he dies a brave and wellbred pagan by his own act ere the stroke of nero reaches him,history
the celebrated madame camfan lady in waiting to marie antoinette and confidant of napoleon by violette m montagu eveleigh nash 15s net hortense has a beautiful disposition we understand one another so perfectly were almost the last words of that survivor of hundreds of wrecked fortunes madame campan it was because she cottld see the beauty in the disposition of many such people as the queen of holland and because her quick and sympathetic nature enabled her to understand perfectly so many of her friends and pupils that she has become one of the most interesting figures in french social history in her wonderful and useful career are interwoven the symbolic bees of napoleon and the bourbon lilies of franceboth stained with the blood of the revolution and ofas it now seemsuseless wars long before we begin miss violette montagus wellarranged and admirably clear account of madame campan we are interested in her but all is newly set forth with skill and leisure from the birth of henriette genist and her acquaintance with the roi bienaime until the last line is penned and this remarkable woman lies in 1822 at peace at last in the cemetery at mantes the intention of the author of this book has been as she says to present a faithful picture of the france of the eil de boeuf and of that greater france when no education was considered complete without a sojourn in paris that parnassus whither napoleon the master mind invited the worlds most gifted artists musicians litterateurs scientists and thinkers this is a bold undertaking but one for which miss montagu would be perfectly fitted but for an occasional efflorescence of style and a slight inclination to wander from the matter in hand but as her more direct work  eugene de beauharnais proved she knows the vast numbers of memoirs of the period perfectly and is completely at ease in later eighteenth and early nineteenth century france while dealing with the fortunes of her heroine all the hurrying pushing palpitating world of louis xv louis xvi of the revolution of the napoleonic era and the confused time that followed are laid before us how low men were and how they rise how high they were and how they tumble o vanity of vanities o laughable pathetic jumble  that is the sort of picture one sees once more in miss montagus interesting pages it is true that much has been told to us before almost all the characters are historical but the author endows them with new life and adds a thousand little touches gathered from wide reading or personal observation which make her story of maman campanfor she was a mother to all the great or wouldbe great ladies of the empirefresh and delightful the reader of today need not trouble himself about the rather heavy and at the same time elusive volumes of memoirs which madame left us for miss montagu has adjusted the stilted style to modern taste the first part of the volume dealing with the court of marie ivntoinette is to some extent madame campans own work wisely edited and assisted by much knowledge gleaned from other and equally useful sources the second part which the author calls the governess of the bonapartes is founded on some of the correspondence between madame campan and the mother of napoleon iii who was of course under her care as hortense de beauharnais and among all her beloved pupils the most beloved the fates may not have allowed all the girls who were brought up by madame campan to prove later very kind or very clever but the governess at least saw that their minds and bodies were perfectly healthy while she could influence them and her carefully thought out methods certainly produced many capable witty women and caused a tradition of wise education to flourish in france even until today madame herself came of a family famous during generations for their taste for hard work and common sense for caution and in some cases coldness but the fine flower of their race the henriette of the present volume combined much knowledge of men and things with wide sympathy and much warmth of character with wisdom which was both lively and discreet from the days when a child lectrice she entered the court of louis xv as the companion of his daughters to the very end she held in her heart the spirit of a devoted and unselfish mother and although her own marriage made by her parents of coursewas unhappy she never failed to make lighter the burdens which others had to bear at fourteen miss montagu says her heroine was in danger of becoming a bluestocking for she was quick and clever and made much of by the various masters of the arts of the day albanesi the most fashionable of singing masters taught her the melodies of the alluring lully while goldoni himself made her familiar with italian the little picture of her as she comes into prominence shows that the bluestocking period was soon over miss montagu pictures her entering the great world wearing a long train her slender figure enclosed in stiff stays and voluminous panniers with her little tearstained face besmirched with rouge and powder her father had given her many wise warnings whenever you receive flattering attentions he said you will gain an enemy of flattery and enemies madame campan had her fair share as the years passed but her head was always cool and her heart true and sound and thus she survivedthe friend of humanity through so many and such various periods of court life her character and her surroundings make her a particularly interesting subject for such a volume as miss montagu gives us it is the life of a wise and sympathetic woman written by anotherand such an alliance will always make a delightful book,history
a diplomatists wife in many lands 2 vols by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson  co animated and rather indiscreet these reminiscences should secure a wide public more especially as beneath their sparkle there lies much sound reflection mrs hugh fraser who is the daughter of a wellknown american sculptor a sister of the accomplished novelist marion crawford and the wife of an english diplomatist has enjoyed an unusual upbringing during a girlhood spent in italy she acquired an intimate acquaintance with society as it existed before the achievement of political unity and she remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order her arguments do not always carry persuasion but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion it had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority thus gregory xvi displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green turkish trousers whatever the rest of their costume might be and by swaddling the figures on the tomb of paul iii in casttin draperies painted to match the colour of the marble  officials if prince massimo can be taken as a type were not overscrupulous  he was for many years postmastergeneral and utilised hh facilities to make a valuable collection america was a long way off frcm rome at that time  and every letter that my people received from the united states had had the ste mps boldly cut out of the envelope before it was handed over to the postman we get a pretty picture of priestly discipline in the alban hills  the great preoccupation in the castelli as the mountain villages are called is to keep the girls out of harms way i have heard the preacher say to the women 4 never mind about the men they were mado of different stuff to you  they can be sometimes bad and sometimes good but you cannot a woman must be either an angel or a devil there is no place between for her  the good priest therefore used to make them work in the fields in twos and threes and he would count them at the entrance of the town when they returned to see that no girl was loitering alone mrs fraser does not pay compliments to those whom others would call the liberators of italyvictor emmanuel for instance farini and garibaldi but we do not understand why a mystery should be mode of  garibaldis englishman his name was john whitehead peard he was a member of a wellknown west country family and he died in 1880 mrs fraser is definite however about that staunch champion of the temporal power cardinal antonelli whom she draws with vigorous strokes  44 in appearance he was a typical south italian small in build darkskinned with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell nothing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them his face wes meant to be mobile but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour he was a rapidly fluent talker and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us the italian chapters in this book are on the whole the most interesting but mrs fraser seems to have a happy knack of making amusing acquaintances wherever she goes she sits opposite a benevolent old gentleman at an hotel dinner and he reveals himself as edward lear the author of the book of nonsense a firm believer in ghosts she has collected some gruesome stories about them  and it appears that julius hare so excelled as a narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away in the second volume we are trans ported to peking and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two dowager empresses of whom the first died during the boxer rebellion whereupon the second who had been trained for the purpose promptly took her place mrs frasers argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than fortyfive or fifty and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate be that as it may she illustrates the pride of the chinese by a significant story  after the looting of the palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the imperial family through the chinese ambassador take them away exclaimed the minister they are desecrated filthywe never want to see them again mrs fraser concludes with vienna from 1880 to 1882 she does not spare the court and some of her stories about the empress are a little unkind she writes of the unfortunate however in a chivalrous spirit notably of benedek the defeated at sadowa whom she considers to have been the victim of the incompetence of others and who went to the grave without an attempt to exculpate himself in taking leave of these agreeable volumes we may remark that it was sir henry wotton not sir thomas more who defined an ambassador as  an honest man sent to he abroad for the good of his country  p vii,history
mary of iiuriundy or thc revolt of ghent hy the author of  darnley  richelieu  henry 3iasterton acc a vols ljino london 1 llia longman and co wi cannot hesitate in calling this decidedly the very best romance that mr james has produced the mystery and the interest are alike well sustained and the principal character delineated with a degree of dramatic power that i marks those happier creations of the author which stand out from the common run of fictitious heroes albert maurice the young burgher is a noble conception well filled up and in good keeping with the time when the demarcations of society were so broadly drawn and yet oftentimes so suddenly reversed the period too is one of much attraction the low countries have been our european nurseries of commerce and liberty they were the first to break up the foundations of that great feudal system which growing at first out of the necessity for protection which the distracted state of kuroio made necessary in the turbulence of its early darkness became afterwards so intolerably oppressive when peace had its claim as well as war trade brought wealth which was power and brought still morea habit of enterprise men saw the necessity of protection for their gains  hence arose certain rights and privileges wrung first from the weakness of some ruler who looked not beyond the present often revoked and often infringed yet the precedent once established became an authority for war freedom soon took a more extended view and out of those civic immunities and commercial protections grew those ideas of mans unalienable rights now so well understood and so generally insisted upon these volumes present a most animated picture of the period with its tumults and troubles its forests swarming with freebooters its nobles still looking upon themselves as earths savon red ones its burghers growing every day mure conscious of their importance  and the one or two of highertoned minds who inspired by patriotism planned more important schemes for the benefit of their own native lands and towns such are the materials which have been wrought out with animation worthy of those stirring days while the repose of so sweet and gentle a being as mary of burgundy is in excellent relief to the darker shadows of the picture the ensuing passages may show with what grace the embellishments are thrown in wc shall only premise that albert maurice is the young burgher on whose talent and influence with his fellowcitizens most ol the story turns 4 livery one knows that in the early dawn j of a sicilian morning the shepherds and the watchers on the coast ofthe messinese strait i will sometimes behold in the midst ofthe clear 1 unclouded blue of the sky a splendid hut de lusivu pageant which is seen also though in a j less vivid form amongst the hebrides towels i and castles domes and palaces festivals and i processions arrayed annies and contending hosts pass for a few minutes in brilliant con fusion before the eyes of the beholders and then fade away as if the scenes of another i world for some especial purpose conjured up for a moment and then withdrawn for ever from their sight thus there are times too i iii the life of man when the spirit excited hy some great and stirring passion or hy mingling with mighty and portentous events seems to gain for a brief instant a confused but magnificent view of splendid things not yet in being imagination in the one case and hope in the other give form aud distinctness to the airy images though both are too soon doomed to fade away amidst the colder realities of the stern world we dwell in the mind of albert maurice had been excited by the scenes lie hat just gone through  and success without making him nrrogant had filled him full of hope mach step that he took forward seemed but to raise him higher and each effort of an enemy to crush him seemed without any exertion of his own but to clear the way before him such thoughts were mingling with other feelings  brought forth by the sight and the roice and the smile of mary of burgundy when the sudden call to her presence woke him from ouch dreams but woke him only to show to his minds eye a thousand confused but bright and splendid images as gay as glittering as pageantlike but as unreal also as the airy vision which hangs in the morning light over the sicilian seas fancy at once called up every thing within thu wide range of possibility battles and victories and triumphant success the shout of nations and of worlds the sceptre the palace and the throne with a thousand indistinct ideas of mighty things danced before his eyes for a moment with a sweeter and brighter image too as the object and end of ambition the reward of mighty endeavour the crowning hoon of infinite success but still he felt and knew even while he dreamed that it was all unreal and as he followed the messenger with a puck pace though vision faded and left him but the cold and naked truth at length after passing through several chambers which flanked thc hall of audience the door of a small apartment called the bower was thrown open and the young burgher stood once more before mary of burgundy lue of the most painful curses of high station is that of seldom if ever being alone of having no moment except those intended for repose in which to commune with ones own heart without the oppression of some human eye watching the emotions of the mind as they act upon the body and keeping sentinel over the hearts index  the face mary of burgundy was not alone though as much alone as those of her station usually are  she stood near ja window at the other side ofthe apartment with her soft rounded arm and delicate hand j twined in those of one of her fair attendants  alice of imbercourton whom she leaned slightly while the lord of imbercourt himself stood beside her on the other hand and with his stately head somewhat bent seemed with all due reverence to give her counsel upon some private matter of importance how beautifully the next landscape is blended with human associations   lt was towards that period of the year which the french call the short summer of st martin from the fact of a few lingering bright days of sunshiny sweetness breaking in upon the autumn as a memorial of the warmer season gone before the sky was full of light and the air full of heat and the grand masses of high grey clouds that occasionally floated over the sun were hailed gladly for their soft cool shadow although the day was the eleventh of november sweeping over the prospect like the mighty but indistinct images of great things and splendid purposes that sometimes cross a powerful but imaginative mind the shadows of thc clouds moved slow over hill aud dale field and forest noss they cast large masses of the woods into dark and gloomy shade and left the rising grounds around to stand forth in light and sparkling brightness giving no bad image of the dark memories that are iu every heart surrounded but not effaced by afterjoys noss they floated soft upon the mountains spreading an airy purple over each dell and cavity while pouring into the midst of the valley the bright orb of day lighted up tosser and town and farm and hamlet and village spire as hope lights up the existence of man even while the many clouds of fate hang their heaviest shadosvs ou the prospect round about him the harmonious hue of autumn too was over all the world russet svas the livery of the year  and the brosn fields preparing for the sower idle red only a deeper hue ol the same colour which though varied

now cast her into a swoon  and darting through the door by which they had entered the vert gallant of hannut and his companions passed out into that part of the  forest which swept up to though back of the hapel they escape in perfect safety hut as they return they again pass the chapel    the scene that she there beheld was not a little awful three of the walls of the chapel indeed remained but that was all and the timedried woodwork that had supported the tall conical roof now lay on what had once been the floor still blackened and smouldering though the lire which had been kindled by the lightning was now half extinguished by the suhseiuent rain the chapel itself however though it showed how terrible her own fate might have been was not perhaps the most fearful object that the spot presented th tall majestic tree which had stood alone at a i icw yards in advance of the building was rent  to the very ground  and amidst the shivered j boughs and yellow leaves with which they were  covered lay motionless the beautiful horse that  had been tied there with its strong aud ener1 getic limbs  but a few hours before full oil wild life and noble firenow cold and stilf the wide expansive nostril small and collapsedthe clear eye dim and leaden and the proud head cast powerless down the bank there are few things show so substantially the j mighty and awful power of death as to see ai nollie horse killed by some sudden accident the moment before it stands at the sublimest  point of animal existenceas if the living principle were yielded to it in a greater share j than any other thing and the next it isl shapeless carrion  alas the poor horse  cried mary when her eyes fell upon the gallant beast lying stretched out beneath the tree  alas the poor horse   but by a natural link of association her mind speedily reverted to herself and the fate she had so narrowly escaped  and closing her eyes while the litter i was born on she spent a few moments in i thankful prayer wv shall conclude by repeating our com meiidatioii and opinion that mary of ii ii ry it inly is and it is praise of a very high order the i most interesting and most sustained of mr jamess already so popular historical fictions  mary of burgundy or thc ltccolt of ghcul ky the author of  darnley sec  vols longniiin  co tins is perhaps the best oftho authors works at any rate xve have been much moved by the details and interested in the fate of its leading characters there is we think more true dignity in the conception of the stories ami more chivalrous feeling in the knights mid dames of mr jamess romances than in those of any living novelist lie has the eye of a painter and something of the feeling of the poet he seeks to do justice to the heroic part of human nature and bestows beautiful forms and lofty aspirations he arrays the creations of his fancy in thc splendid costume of the times of the tournaments and throws what thc paintcrscall aline aerial atmosphere over the actions they arc called on to perform vc see too all that the mitbor sees his outline is distinct and bold  we are made familiar xvith thc motives as well as xvith thc deeds of his actors  and what is still better there i is a visible unity of purpose throughout to i which all parts are subordinatea certain  sign of true genius in an author we cannot i however conceal from ourselves that other  writers have excelled him in natural dolinea i timi of character in simplicity of narrative j nid in those electric bursts of passion which kindle all around like sunshine bursting over  a clouded landscape he is likewise a little too fond of painting scenery and describing  dresses and we could lind other faults hut were his faults doubled they are more than atoned for by his beauties among which tte have neglected to reckon a hatred and loathing for all that is mean and base and a desire to lift human nature a degree above the mires and sloughs of vulgar sensuality in which so many natures still delight to wallow the scene of this story is laid in the city of lhent the ehiefaetorsaro princes priiieeses and citizens and the time is during those  stormy days when mary only

his tragic end the author will answer that a narrative for which history had set up landmarks obliged him so to deal with characters created to help out the story this may bo so  still we consider it unfair to create ii noble creature only to show how handsomely he ctn be knocked on the head we are of opinion that though author has adhered too closely to history  it was enough to have caught its
