  the gipky a tale bh the author of richelieu svolsthe incidents of this tale are exceedingly improbable the characters such as rarely occur and the progress and development of the plot too dark and mysterious such a gypsy as pharold never perhaps could exist such a villain as lord duory if he did should be forgotten these are the two principal characters and they are sketched especially the former with a powerful and vigorous hand yet we can hardly say that there is much originality in them the author must be content to have profited by the creations which have been raised by his predecessors yet notwithstanding these defects the work is far above the common standard and indeed often approaches a high degree of excellence the scenes are pleasingly and elegantly written many observations and reflections are profound and apposite many beautiful descriptions occur and some skilful development of character is found we only wish that the author had taken a more familiar ground and that the excitement caused by the folly of some and the crime of others had arisen from more pleasurable sources,englishfiction
jerningham a story new novels 2 vols chapman  hall this story is  an essence compounded with very little art out of the novels of bulwer dickens disraeli and dumas the style is like palais royal jewelry very fine and very flashy but will hardly bear testing the novel as a novel is as unreal as a book can beand not one whit the nearer being ideal on that account we have very seldom fallen upon a work so false meretricious and selfcomplacent the authors own good opinion of himself is the only genuine thing about it the story is about anything and everything under the sun and moon each chapter has the air of having been written for some of the illustrations we are accustomed to see at the head of the romances in penny journals we have in it a gypsy queen named ayesha who is betrayed and abandoned by lord haverdale a fashionable english nobleman of the blast profligate type  a darkbrowed scowling gypsy man the lover of ayesha who sets a heath on fire and murders squire jerningham in mistake for his rival squire jerningham who has ruined himself by gambling and whose widow dies a few days after the funeral leaving an infant son quite unprovided for this is the introduction and then the pantomime begins young jerningham runs away from school and begins life as the hero of the book a crowd of real personages are introduced by nametalleyrand fouche the prince de conde and his mistress madame de la feucheres pauldidier inspector thomas there is also a host of other wellknown individuals under slight disguises the murder of the duke de berri is amongst the incidents of the book  which however have no other cohesion or natural sequence than the stitching that holds the pages together they might have been shook out of a dicebox so far as any order or the natural working out of the story is concerned ayesha the gypsy pursues her revenge and seeks her child through the pages at intervals she endows jerningham with a gypsy treasure with which he makes agreat figure in the world he does many wonderful things and becomes the idol of society but the most signal of his successes is that he takes a beautiful orphan to live with hima miracle of purity and virtue and beauty without exciting a grain of slander or evil speaking  they live first in his lodgings in westminster and then at a paradise of a cottage on the banks of the thames she goes on the stageachieves a signal triumph  and marries a certain rich baronet from the best of motives which naturally displeases jerningham and makes him for a time misanthropic of course marie the orphan is the missing child of ayesha and lord haverdale there is a denoiiment at last the wicked people who are left alive cast their slough and come out angelsayesha is transformed into a ministering angel and a member of the church of england though she did at first feel tempted to enter a convent lord haverdale becomes quite respectable and although he does not marry ayesha he does justice to another lady who has equal claims upon himmarie lady malcomm is left a widow long before the end but jerningham being very proud will not relent and take advantage of her continued attachment to him so she grows pale and thin and visits the poor with her mother for whom she feels a romantic attachmentatlast jerningham finds that he is making himself miserable as well as  marieand relents in his own favourand the  curtain drops upon the superhuman felicity of  everybody,englishfiction

dulcie everton new novels by e lynn linton 2 vols chatto  windus the best part of mrs lintons new novel is the truthful description of the neighbourhood of  green lanes with its modest squirearchy living country lives  doing all that falls within the range of latterday duties whereby it is hoped to somewhat delay the final disintegration of society as we have it and to maintain the old organisation for some time longer a rather dull and rococo society but clean and honest among them all was not one unfaithful wife  not one notoriously gambling drunken or dissipated husband in this gentle fellowship and in an oldfashioned home with its daintily touched sentiment of simplicity and reserve grows up dulcie everton a fresh and wholesome english maid  untried undeveloped untested her latent force yet undiscovered  like the curled crozierhead of a future fern the process of development is a hard one when her friend martin harrowby returns from his foreign tour with his frank joyance gone and comes to her for consolation she accepts him in all good faith and believes she has loved him all her life but martin has passed through the fires of passion and his memory dwells too faithfully on the woman who has fanned them but declined from no lack of reciprocation to compromise herself socially for his sake elaine the treacherous wife of the faithful jacques courcelles the honest bourgeois of paris is almost too complete a picture of the unscrupulous adventuress it is about her that the action of the story is concentrated it is dulcies hard fate that sends elaine to england when with soft and ruthless hands she has done to death her patient and not unconscious husband as the bride of dulcies brother and bent on vengeance upon martin and his wife henceforth it is that gentle souls experience to find her honest affection vain beside the fascination of the enchantress to learn the cause of her husbands coldness to lose for a time even the accustomed tenderness of her parents love how elaine reaps the reward of her unbridled love of intrigue falling at last by the miserable egotism of the underbred poetaster percy merritt is tragically told but the climax of the heroines story is reached when openeyed and unforgetful she makes the advance dictated by pity and regains her love for the man who has through such dismal lapse and error brought out the latent beauties of her gracious and lofty nature short as is the tale and certainly deficient in the delineation of any male character worth analysis the doglike fidelity of jacques being hardly an exception as a study of feminine antagonism this book is full of power,englishfiction
  between the acts by henry w nevinson ivtuuvu murray the drama of life says mr nevinson is divided into acts and only in the intervals when the actdrop falls do we become conscious of the real significance of what has passed that is certainly true of most men and applying it he remarks that in the majority of autobiographies we are most interested when the writer forgets his own prominence and introduces figures which have  moved upon the distant stage and but for his notice would have been forgotten we are to understand apparently that these sketches represent such retrospect casual episodes and situations which i have observed or imagined  in these entractes of life that  imagined has we think much virtue it is difficult to conceive that most of these sketches are actual experiences unless mr nevinson has been given unusually romantic opportunities in fact apart from the two opening essays for such they may be called these sketches based on observed fact or not take the shape of short tales nowise to be distinguished from the short story in general whatever their origin they are well written and that is all which matters the first two essays are personal reminiscences of childish or boyish scenes the second is a record of schooldays very well done but we prefer the first  a london merchant it is merely a sketch of a grandfathers family prayers and the various members of the household assembled for that rather gloomy function but it is done with an excellent quietness and geniality of humour from the evangelical and tory grandfather tb the housekeeper on whose head fluttered the supersensual essence of a cap they are all types and types of that older world well worth preservation the evangelical grandfather is a delightful personage dexterously remembered for sunday reading he chiefly commends the children to  the family sepulchre he once alarmed the household by reciting a poem of moores but his customary attitude towards such sinful frivolities was stern the family aunts in their youthful years he led to hear joanna baillie recite one of her  plays of the passions yon know or you do not know those  plays of the passions they are perfectly academic passions but midway he arose  my dears this is no fit place for you he pronounced and led the four daughters out in file leaving the licentious poetess to finish her drama as best she might after such a testimony to its seductive power poor academic joanna yet despite his evangelicalism he was a rigid tory because un ancestor was reputed to have rendered some vague service to king charles the martyr you know that old man though you probably never have met him but the remainder of the contents as we have said are veritably short stories they are all psychological studies phases of character not of special originality not what we should call brilliant they are yet skilfully handled with a mastery over the mechanism of the short story and with much delicacy in the analysis of temperament one for instance  a dons day is the study of a university don with an undecided and undecidable vocation for the church it is we think a lit le overemphasized the valetudinarian and incessant diagnosis of his own spiritual state though recognisably possible and in the picture awakens the readers impatience to a degree we scarce think intended the man is an insufferable and weakminded prig who wants shaking that may be the authors verdict  since he ends by making him set off as a foreign missionary but one is not hopeful of his missionary future one doubts whether he has the pluck or unselfishness for the zeal to be lasting his vacillation and selfabsorption are overdrawn in fact another sketch shows a journalist unselfishly spending himself for a girl who accepts his devotion blindly and is in love with a poet we do not recognise that poet he is too brilliant in talk too romantic altogether the poet of commerce is not that way and we would back the journalist against him with the young lady but it is sympathetically done  en revanche a further story presents a poet as the luckless lover outrivalled by a professor who deserts the lady of their common affection they meet her afterwards as a worn and toomarried woman with a sick husband and the other appurtenances of the situation but the thing is worked out with a tenderness which effaces its conventional elements in truth these are very clever sketches possessing both emotional and humorous power at once delicate and restrained they stand well above the usual level even of the wellwritten short story  between the acts by henry wv nezinson gs net murray in this exceedingly interesting miscellany nmr nevinson has embodied much of personal observation and experience the two opening essays give very vivid and pleasant glimpses of the authors earlier years both at home and at school and are written with a charm and a quiet humour that tempt one back to read them through again the stories are wonder fully varied  in twentyfocr hours an episode of the terrible stampede of the greeks in their war against turkey is charged with a tense but reticent pathos and the fearsome panicstricken flight itself is described with such an imaginative realism that it haunts the reader almost as if it were an actual memory of his own other stories are of the boer war of various phases of life abroad of journalistic life at home and one  the last rag is of lower london and will rank with mr nevinsons masterly and never sufficiently recognised neighbours of ours the lyrics interspersed among the stories are touched with a grace and melody of poetic fancy and emotion of the ballads perhaps a ballad of gods mercy is the most powerful and the most finely imaginative this is an arresting and a memorable book written with the sureness of touch the knowledge of life and broad humanity that marks all mr nevinsons best work,englishfiction
the pillars of the house the pillars of the house or under ttode under rode by charlotte m yonge author of thc heir of redclyffe c in four volumes macmillan we fancy that miss yonges publishers exercised a wise discretion in issuing  the pillars of the house  in instalments of a volume at a time the heart of the boldest and most eager novelreader might have quailed before the achievement of mastering the four volumes at once 1220 pages each containing we should say at least half as much again as a page of an ordinary novel the book is in fact hardly so much a novel as an imaginary family history an account during a period of eighteen years of the fortunes of the thirteen sons and daughters of the rev edward underwood and mary his wife the youngest of whom a twin boy and girl are born on the very day of their fathers death for purposes of reference we are favoured with a copy of the first page of the underwood family bible setting forth the christian names in full and the dates of birth of the thirteen heroes and heroines as well as with a rough outline map of the vale leston estate and a ground plan of the house mr underwood had married his distant cousin the niece and adopted daughter of the rector of vale leston with the assurance of ultimately succeeding to the living and meantime acting as curate it was a family living always held conjointly with a tolerably good estate enough to qualify the owner for what miss young considers the dangerous position of squarson but the uncle dying suddenly and with a flaw in his will an undesirable nephew and heiratlaw whom he had desired to exclude stepped in and disliking mr underwoods high church opinions made his own son take orders for the sake of the living edward underwood took a curacy at bexley and as his stipend did not increase and his family did overwork and worry have so told on a not naturally strong constitution that he dies before we have got through the first 100 pages of the book and his wife soon follows him then felix the eldest son a boy of sixteen for the sake of his family renounces all thought of oxford and the church and becomes assistant to mr froggat the bexley bookseller who combines with his business the proprietorship of the pursuivant a local journal and he and wilmet the eldest girl resolve to be pillars of the house and keeps home together for the younger ones it is the history and result of their endeavour that forms the theme of the story we shall not attempt any summary of the book which indeed would be impossible within anything like reasonable limits it will be sufficient to say a few words as to its general character it is prolix  it is sometimes tedious  it is so overcrowded with characters that we get into a maze as to whos who  we are often bored with its nursery and schoolroom moralities and long to escape into a higher and freer atmosphere and yet somehow we are interested in it and carried on to the end as we often fail to be by many books showing far higher mental gifts in their authors miss young is one of those who receive the blessing promised to whosoever is faithful over a few things her range is of the narrowest but within it she shows herself thoroughly the artist nearly all her characters herecertainly all the thirteen underwoods have a distinct life and individuality of their own though author hardly tells us a word about them but shows them to us as they are and makes us watch them through a growth and development which poor and stunted as it must be deemed by all whose minds are not cramped by the shackles of her prim anglicanism we yet feel is true and consistent naturally she succeeds better with her women than her menor rather wo should say with her girls than her boys for whatever be the time of life  assigned to them her leading dramatis jvrsona always bear distinctly the stamp of nonage the austerity and excessive prudence and carefulness developed in wilmet through her youthful responsibilities when she has to think hard how to make the most of every halfpenny in the shilling a devotion to the commonplace strangely at variance with her faultlessly beautiful faceis excellently and most amusingly sketched indeed the beautiful face i9 to the practical wilmet  w w as her brothers cali her from her two names wilmet ursula rather an annoying superfluity im sure she says i should be glad enough not to be pretty but it is a trial and one must do the best one can even greater skill is shown in the picture of the lame girl geraldine or cherry who is to us the most interesting of the group and with her genius her passion for art and beauty and her bright wit reminds usa long way off it is truebut still does remind us of the charming eugenie de la ferronnaye though miss young is quite without any deep humour she has a great appreciation of liveliness and wellbred fun andwe have laughed heartily over many of her scenes her pathetic passages too have often great tenderness and beauty though she is here on dangerous ground for she has a hankering after melancholy details and mere sentimentalism which continually threatens to lead her astray wre have wished sometimes that miss young could at a sufficiently early age have been brought under the influence of wider and freer modes of thinking and viewing things than that prevalent in the refined and scholarly but intensely narrow clerical circles whose spirit she reproduces so faithfully she might so have been led to apply her powers of realistic painting which in a certain way are really great to the production of something higher and worthier than pictures of the rather small lives of some halffledged boys and girls more or less good or  naughty yet probably for her readers at any rate it is better as it is she would have been puzzled and overwhelmed if told to see life with her own eyes and finds ecclesiastical leadingstrings a support more than a restraint we doubt if she would have ever done really better work than she does now in the field that has become natural to her a field hedged in by the proprieties and respectabilities with the creeds and the church catechism accepted on all hands as the dernier mot of speculation and morality thence she can look out on the waste lands of schism that lie beyond and on those gloomier regions in the far distance the  antres vast and deserts idle the home of rationalism and unbelief she gives us highlyfinished cabinet pictures of the quiet scenes familiar to her we can only wish that viinrr the crallery g 8 of the qatet scenes iauu   aiiert she would not

  the portent a story of the inner vision of thc highlanders commonly called the second sight by george macdonald smith elder  co there was no need for the semiapologetic preface prefixed by mr macdonald to his romance there is no style of novel gone by beyond the power of rehabilitation a straightforward good ghost story would be just as acceptable now as were  the mysteries of udolpho and the family of montono jn their time  though in both of those books the error was committed of not implicitly trusting to the supernatural but of explaining away the terror what can exceed the fascination of wandering willies tale in  redgauntlet we had no particular liking it will be recollected for the  strange story with its subtleness of  fate and metaphysical entanglement but the scene of the raising of the dead at derval court held us as fast as the ancient mariner held the wedding guest mr macdonald does not rise to the height of radcliffe or maturin or scott or sir e lytton but his supernatural romance is nevertheless a thrilling gtory the defect a grave one is that the heroine u not distinctly present to us neither do we see why at last she should be extricated from the thraldom spiritual and temporal which so long hung over her if mr macdonald intends to make further excursions into the land of shadows he will do well to recollect that the darker the clouds above him the longer the vistas of vapours on every side the greater is his own need of a firm footing a vigorous grasp on the fear of those whom it is his purpose to enthral owing to vacillation he just falls short in  the portent of effecting his purpose yet the story as it stands has merit of no common order,englishfiction

novels the dukes cahihren by anthony trollope chapman and hall limited london in his last novel mr trollope pursues his old plan of bringing many of the familiar and absurdlynamed characters of former works again on to the scene a few die and fresh ones immediately take their place but the haunts they frequent the society they mingle in and the manners they adopt show but little variation the dukes children  of course keeps the reader almost exclusively in those upper circles which mr trollope describes and loves so well we are introduced immediately after the poor duchess of omnium has died and we find the poor duke plunged in grief not only is he heartbroken at the loss of his wife but he is dismayed at the prospect of having to look after his daughter lady mary palliser aged nineteen he takes counsel of mrs phineas finn his late wifes most intimate friend and she advises that a companion should be found for lady mary the duke proposes that mrs finn should be the companion for the time being at any rate but to this plan the latter is strongly disinclined because she suspects that lady mary has formed an attachment for a gentleman whom the duke would certainly not approve of asa husband forhis daughter hersuspicions turn out to have been well founded lady mary confesses to her that she loves mr francis tregear the gentlem3n in question who will only have fifteen hundred a year when his mother dies when mrs finn learns this she tells lady mary that she mrs finn must inform the duke at once unless mr tregear will save her the trouble then with lady marys consent she determines to see mr tregear and talk to him on the subject we may say at once that mr tregear has no disqualification for being the soninlaw even of the duke of omnium except that he is poornd has no title he is a gentleman highly educated extremely handsome and the intimate friend of lord silverbridge the dukes eldest son even the duchess had smiled on his suit but now she is dead and gone so mrs finn goes to see tregear they have a long conversation the end of which is that tregear against his will is persuaded into promising that he will tell the duke of his love for lady mary within a week and he fulfils his promise he enters the dukes studio one evening  looking beautiful as apollo as he stood upright before his wishedfor fatherinlaw the duke however is not sufficiently overcome by his appearance to entertain his proposal for one instant when he has got over his surprise at tregeares astounding audacity he simply replies  of course it is impossible you are not so ignorant but that you must have known as much when you came to me but tregear will not admit that it is impossible and they proceed to argue the matter out the dukes non possurnus prevails in the end however and tregear after having let out that ms finn was aware of the young peoples attachment is dismissed with a curt  good morning sir a form of adieu which testifies to the dukes confusion of mind it being at the time 6 pm the duke soon afterwards sees his daughter and tells her also that it is impossible but she is just as difficult to convince as tregear she will not even promise not to write to tregear though she declares that should she feel obliged to do so she will tell her father what she has written the duke is discomfited but he determines to hand lady mary over to some stern female friend who would aid him in preventing the contemplated ilsaliance while these events are occurring the reader is taken with lord silverbridge to the beargarden club and there made acquainted with several other scions of the nobility as well as major ti to a sporting associate of the dukes son then a little later on we make the acquaintance of lady mabel grex a rather basese young beauty the daughter of earl grex a shabby genteel and somewhat scandalous old nobleman it is soon apparent that lord silverbridge is half inclined to fall in love with lady mabel presently the reader is permitted to see that lady mabel is in love with frank tregear although she will not own to it the truth is they had very nearly been engaged once and would have been quite if lady mabel had not seen that for two paupers as she described frank and herself to think of marrying would be absurd and now frank tregear has fallen in love with somebody else and though it was her own doing lady mabel cannot but feel wounded that her lover should take her so readily at her word and now she is resolved to have lord silverbridge who seems nothing loth yet on one occasion when he almost proposes to her she almost tells him she will not have him but she feels sure that he will not be content with this answer and when he next asks her she will accept him but she has not reckoned on the appearance of a certain miss isabel boncassen a very beautiful american heiress who with her father and mother now comes on the scene lord silverbridge is at once captured by the new belle and of course as the duke is horrified at the thought of his eldest son marrying an american whose materr al parent says 11oh laws  and the like further complications at once ensue additional interest is given to the development of the plot by the introduction of various subsidiary episodes there are some election scenes occasioned by lord silverbridge going into parliament sporting readers will be interested in the chapters devoted to horseracing and the manner in which lord silverbridge is sold by his friend major tifto but the main purpose of the story is to show how the duke of omniums children fell in love with people of inferior station to themselves how their father quarrelled with them for so doing and how in the end the noble family were reconciled mr trollope tells this story with fluency but whether after all it is worth the telling is another matter mr trollopes great fault as apparent as ever in his last work is the superficiality of his characters it is impossible to feel any real interest in their fortunes or in the storms in teacups which the authoreis perpetually rousing frank tregear shows only one conspicuous quality from first to last and that is his determination to marry lady mary the converse of this may be said with equal truth of the dukes daughter no reader will have any doubt regarding the ultimate end of the lovers difficulties which end by the way is exceedingly tame when it does come the story of the dukes injustice to mrs finn fills several pages and is told with great circumlocution but not a particle of interest attaches to the imbroglio the only person in the book for whom any real sympathy can be felt is lady mabel grex with all her faults she is womanly and has to endure real suffering tregears treatment of her is as cruel as it is unnatural  i i i moreover it seems to us as much a mistake to wake lady mabel so far forget herself as to actually ask lord silverbridge to marry her as to afterwards allow her to tell him that she never loved him yet despite these blemishes in her character the sympathies of most readers will be with lady mabel especially as she is the only person in the book who is left

jewels in brass by jittie horlick duckworth and co 6s miss jittie horlick has accomplished two things in which many more experienced novelists fail in  jewels in brass  there is an arresting beginning and a graceful close the mythical continent of atlantis forms the scene of the opening chapters two characters figure here which are afterwards reincarnated in ordinary modern forms they consist of a charming young woman and a gentleman with peculiar eyes destined in his previous state to meet and be attracted by this same young woman the scene of their first meeting and the barriers to their union must be left to the reader to discover throughout the story there are several flashes of very good insight into the workings of the womans mind although there cannot be said to be any considerable development of it after her first great step the book consists more of a series of incidents and ordinary happenings rather than any particular delineation of character the whole forms very agreeable reading however and those who pursue the story to its end can be promised an hour or twos keen enjoyment,englishfiction

the wine of life by maude annesley john lane mrs annesley treats with sympathy and power the old theme of the woman with a thirst for carnal pleasure her first chapters relating to an abominable husbands triumph in the divorce court are remarkably clever and though in the continental experiences of the divorced heroine there are passages glowing with juvenile romanticism the author atones for them by the hungarian episode out of which is developed the final tragedy of the book in kurtesz thc hungarian politician whose love is morbid thrilling and insane the author has drawn an ideal player on the nerves of sex he is a horror but both the artist who precedes and the writer who succeeds him in the divorced ladys affections are tame and flat compared with him the hungarian background is well rendered it is creditable to mrs annesley that she does not exaggerate the attitude of english society towards a lady who has technically offended it mrs annesley with her hawklike eye for situation to which is due the abruptness of her finale could write we think a successful melodrama  the wine of life by maud annesley lane 6s miss annesley has the ability to write a pleasant novel about pleasant people if she would be content to be simple she is able to endow her characters with a certain degree of charm and that is a considerable gift she takes pains over the details of her work in a way that shows that she takes her work seriously and executes it with care but in the present novel which appears to be her first she has aimed at achieving a great study of passion freed from all conventional trappings and has succeeded in being feebly sensational lady uh branton is quite a charming person when she is not dragged into impossible love scenes we like to accompany her and dorry on their travels their gaiety and happiness when they make the acquaintance of the french artists at versailles is delightfully contagious their adventures in hungary are well told we agree with most of her ideas too about love but when the attempt is made to lift the story into the passionate sphere it fails signally and is comparable only with the foolish sensational ending this is a great pity because nearly ail me characters have ari agreeable semblance of vitality except the hungarian lover who walks straight out of the cheapest melodrama and we are interested in them and like them if miss annesley would cultivate the gift she has and leave sensation to its proper place in the feuilleton she would write a very pretty story,englishfiction

new novels a magdalens husband by vincent brown duckworth  co tue motto chosen by the author for this remarkable study of village life in england is  they know not at what they stumble and it is finely appropriate some readers will remember this authors ordeal by compassion and such will look for serious artistry and conscientious psychological analysis in the present volume they will not be disappointed the book is full of such patient and minute analysis it has real spiritual significance the author does not tell us where the village is in which his lovingly delineated characters move and have their being and the time may be the present but though the human local colouring if one may use the phrase is admirably and distinctively worked in time and place are of no importance in such a story the emotions dealt with were as active the grave complications were as real and as ever present under the first edward of england as they are under edward vii  a magdalens husband has points in common with tess of the durbervilles the authors mental outlook reminds one somewhat of mr hardys but it is less powerful less farseeing enough has been said to indicate that his book does not at all belong to the common order of novels many pages tempt the reviewer to quotation but this is not a volume of smart dialogue there is not an epigram in it and that being so it does not lend itself to brief representative quotation the story is of a woman seduced led and driven into an immoral life and subsequently brought to tread the thorny road of selfredemption reformed she marries a coarse passionate man of her own village chiefly one supposes to win a home and she is loved ardently seriously deeply by another man of the village a man cast in a far finer mould than her husband with all her real goodness and sweetness of character this magdalen is a singularly tactless person a deep honest nature hopelessly lacking in adaptability therein lies her tragedy as a wife her husband has his good points  her hopeless want of tact renders them ineffective then comes murder and the tragedy of the tale deepens the murderers atonement is a strong piece of work and the whole is a fine study as a drama it would have been more effective if the woman had been made more lovable if she were more really and less consciously a martyr the book might have taken rank with the best but as it is it is notable there is something curiously feminine by the way in the authors handling of men  ilovel vtotes a magdalens husband by vincent brown 6s duckworth and co the spring season has given us one heartening surprie at least in the novel which messrs duckworth publish under the title a magdalens husband feihlais this title is not the best that could have been chosen but the story itself is beyond doubt exceptional powerful moving it is a detailed drama of life in an english village of fine natures and debased at the same time it is a transcript of life in the large a widelyobserved tragedy of primal passions and spiritual force revealed with the slow biting skill of the man who sees and feels the great beyond the little and tells of it with that deep emotion which makes no loud noise but stirs the source of tears something of the terse force of thomas hardy is here in this book of strength and promise,englishfiction
the history of matthew wald i i e i f is no feature in which the novels of our age liffer more from those of the last than in the speculative and ideal cast which they have assuned the bustling plots crowded with incidentsthe characters leveloping themselves only in action the brief and meagre descriptions the system which considered subjert as every thing and execution a matter of comparative insignificance have been supplanted by more intellectual and we cannot help thinking more interesting views plots have become simple even to poverty the province of action has been narrowed to extend that of thought feeling has become the mainspring of interest and its analyses and expression the test of talent descriptions of external nature have become more graphical and mi nnte and their connexion with the business of the taleas influencing by their secret but sensible power the feelings of the agentsis better understood and rendered more effective and available the first of these systems certainly indicates a want of refined feeling in the public it was altogether of a meaner and more mechanical castit addressed itself to a lower class of feelings and might have been acted on by minds of no deep feeling and even of scanty invention for though the process of creating an original story is one of no trifling effort the task of combination or disjunction is not a difficult one and a very slight acquaintance with the history of fiction enables us to see how frequently the composition of these novels of incident has been a work of alteration rather than invention they had one advantage however in the very mediocrity of the principle on which they were constructed they were seldom tiresome if the reader perused them with little of that deep thrillin interest which he now feels we have no doubt he yawned less also if he wept lessbe laughed more there were fewer chances of failure for the effect of a sequence of ludicrous or striking incidents admitted of little variation and in the hands of an author of the greatest or the most slender talent produced only a pleasure differing a little in degree but the more ambitious system of modern novelists while it renders the power of genius more visible and vindicates more certainly its lreeminence over mediocrity makes the works of the lesser herd utterly wretched and intolerable destitute of those hum bler attractions of plot and incident which they might have attained andl filled with ludicrous and impotent straining after those more magnificent qualities which it is hopeless for them to emulate or aspire to the present work has nothing to do however with these it belongs to the higher class and if we wished to prove the superiority of that principle of effect on which our modern tales are constructed we know not where we should find a better example wdith a plot of a grosslydefective kindwith few incidentsfew characters of importance and one the most interesting of these appearing only and disappearing as in a dreamwith little aid from humour and less from the mere paint ing of external nature in short by the mere force and grandeur of individual scenes and the general eloquence and beauty of the writing this tale creates and maintains the deepest and most vivid interest and we close it at last with those feelings of dreariness and desolation with which we peruse the remorse of caleb williams or the settled gloom of st leon after his final parting with his son often in the course of the story we feel the unsatisfactory na ture of some of the incidentsthe want of connectionof explanation theunreasonablesupinenessof some of the characters at one time and their fiery and needless impatience at others with a multitude of et cetera but still we are hurried along by the impetuosity of the narrative and it is only when we have fairly finished that we have time to think of all the authors offences against consistency and to wonder how with so many faults obvious to every one we should have so yielded to its influence but the truth is aw this only shews how little sucl things 4 d weigh in the balance of excellence and how easily the atoning power of genius can efface such errors the author is evidently a man of great talent his humour to be sure we do not much like but his pathos his scenes of passion and his eloquence are of the highest kind his conception of character we estimate more highly from his reginald dale tonne than from the present work yet even here there is a wonderful effect about his sketches his females we have always thought particularly captivating athanasia was very good andl helen hesketh admirable of the heroine of this tale we see almost nothingsbe is remorselessly married in the beginning and passes only once before our eyes until the conclusionand yet even this unsubstantial pageant has something about it that lingers in our memory another beautiful and quiet female is opposed to her gentle affectionate and tinged with religious melan choly and her character is touched with the same chaste and powerful pencil wald himself we cannot help thinking disagreeable and none of the subordinate agents of the story are particularly interesting but we suppose the reader would rather form his own opinion and though it is difficult to select any pasage that can give a proper idea of the characteristic vigour of the book we shall extract a few of the shortest accompanying them only by such a notice as to render them intelligible the story is related like those of godwin in the first person an arrangement well suited to such tales as depend for their effect on the expose of feeling and particularly to those where the narrator poees no extraordinary qualities euther of evil or good and may therefore

his cousln katharine among the woods and glens of blackford the first interruption to his gaiety is occasioned by the marriage of his aunt with a mr matber who had been tutor in the family and who soon begins to curtail his amusements and to treat him with harshness an in cilent of this kind which young wald revenges with a ferocity above his years leads to his removal to the university of st andrews where he quietly spends two winters in pursuing his studies a sudden resolution strikes him to revisit blackford and it is here that the real interest of the tale begins his feelings when on his arrival he finds a general appearance of restraint and coldness and the attentions of his cousin and his aunt devoted to a fashionable in mate of the housethe honourable mr lascelynethe succession of little incidents trifling in themselves that work upon and irritate his tem per are imagined and executed with great art and probability the fli nishing stroke is given by a discovery which appears to him to confirm his suspicions of katharines attachment to lascelyne and with a promptitude which by the way forms an unnatural contrast to that unresisting irresolute conduct which he dis plays

out and finding the morning fine was tempted to go on i can say i hated the thoughts of taking leavethat at least will be true enough i had opened one of thie windowshut ters and i now thought it would be as well to close it again as i was walking on tiptoe across the room my eye fell on two little black profiles of katharine and myself that we had sat for to an itinerant limner when we were children and which had ever since hung over the chim neypiece i took katharines off the nail and held it for a minute or two in my hand but the folly of the thing flashed upon me in a moment and i re placed it her worktable was by the window and i was so idle as to open the drawer of it a blue sash was the first thing i saw and i stuffied it like a thief into my bosom i then barred the win dow

whether i had lived an hour or a minute when my neighbours rose and i per ceived that the ladies were about to withdraw instinctively i kept my face to the table and fixed my eyes on the opposite wallthe side of the room along which she was wot to pass i was fixedi was a statue and yet i trembled to the bone to think that perhaps the skirt of her gar ment might be rubbing the back of my

laseelynes face he dis mounted and i could not but hear what he said to his groom  tell them said he  that your lady will require the car riage immediately after breakfast in the morning mty horses at the same time for we have a longish sttage tomorrow  yes my lord said the man and i saw the one enter the house and the other take the way towards the stables i prowled about the woods a while and then denned myself in my garret and i need scarcely say that i did not honour the distinguished company with my presence at their breakfasttable next morning but how acute was my ear how distinctly did i hear the carriage steps slap and the wheels begin to roll the death of sir claud breaks up the party wald commences sur geon in the county town in the neigh bourhood and joanne retires to the residence of that old servant who had related her story to matthew wald the following is the picture of their retirement and of one of the visits of wald i deferred this visit therefore till the last evening of my stay when i easily found my way to a lonely and as lovely a retreat certainly as ever sheltered the infirmities of age or the sorrows of youth fast by the green margin of the noble ora and embowered among the fading foliage of his birches stood the little rustic shieling for which that gentle child of misfortune had left the hall of her fa therm the hill rose precipitous behind clothed to the loftiest crag with copses wood from the midst of which here and there the red gigantic trunks of the native pine towered upwards waith their broad sable canopies the wide stream rolling in heavy murmurs close under neath the branches of the trees its dark brown waters gleaming with the gold of the sunset appeared to cut off the wilders ness it embellished from every intrusion of the world asmllu skiff lay chained to the bankand slowly did i urge it with my single strength against the deep and steady flow of the autumnal river from without the appearance of the cottage itself was rude and even desolate but within the habits of another life had already in the course of but a few days begun their triumph i had to stoop ere i could pass the threshold and i trod upon a floor of naked earth but the exquisite cleanliness that had entered with the new inhabitants had of itself robbed poverty of all its meoness every thing upon the walls shone bright in the blaze of the nicelytrimmed wood fire and mammy sat in her elbowchair at the side of it a perfect specimen of the nmajestic repose of extreme but unbend ing age it seemed to me that there was something far more grand about the whole appearance of the old woman now that i saw her under her own paternal roof the bluntness of address and expression which had before been a sort of oddity to amuse a circle of tolerant superiors was now the natural privilege of indepen dence though indeed i am not sure that the sense of home and the instinct of hospitality had not somewhat softened already the external manifestations of a temper which no change of circumstan ces could have essentially altered i was received with courtesyeven with grace and when a minute or two afterwards miss joanne came into the room and modestly saluting me drew her stool towards m1ammys knee i really could not help thinking that in spite of all the young ladys native elegance of aspect and carriage a stranger might easily have been deceived and supposed himself to be contemplating a family group i you will have no great difficulty in believing could not contemplate it with out some feelings of awkwardness as well as of admiration the situation in which i saw joanne bar was new and her demeanour i could not help thinking was almost as greatly changed we had been used to treat each other like friends some spell seemed now to hover over us both our eyes seldom met and neither addressed more than a few syllables to the othershe took her work and i sat listening or pretending to listen to mammy at last i contrived to make it be understood that i had come to take my farewell that i was to leave the country the next morning mammy gave me her blessing very affectionately and i bowed to joanne the poor girl said nothing but in a very low whisper it was  i wish you well sir wherever you go she did not put out her hand and i retired stammering more good byes i jumped into my little boat and had pushed myself a few yards from the brink when i heard my name called in joannes sweet voice and perceived that she had followed me to the bank of the river and was holding something towards me in her hand i ran theskifin again and shc tooped to give me my gloves which i had le behind me our hands touch ed each otherand in the deepening twilight and in the midst of some con fusion of my own i could not be blind to the blush the deep grave timid blush and the troubled workings of that half averted eye how much may pass in a moment my little boat was out in the stream again almost instantly and yet the words return and hope had been whispered and while in rowing acros the river my eyes were fixed upon the lowly cabin i perceived that a shadow was still lingering in the windowand a soft dream floated over my heart that some day i should indeed return and that the world after all might still re tain some visions of hopeay of tender ness and soothing consolation for me even for me no fiery pulse beatno maddening ecstasy or passion fluttered in my brain these were strings which had been snapt but a calm pensive feeling was deep upon me i cannot explain it no man loves twice perhaps in the same sense of the word but although the pinetree will never sprout again after he has been levelled to the ground what need hinder plants of humbler statute yet of softer foliage to spring from the soil beneath which his ponderous roots are mouldering joanne and wald are marriedand great changes follow wald re covers evidence that the connexion between sir claud and the mother of joanne had been such as would according to the law of scotland amount to a regular marriage and that his wife was consequently the heiress of his estatesand the fa mily of sir claud are glad to com promise the matter by ceding to him the property of barrmains his hap piness is qualified however by a strong metlodistical feeling to which the gentle mind of joanne had been for some time yielding and to di vert her attention from those gloomy imaginations which had been created by the preaching of some country fanatic and fostered by solitude he gets into parliament and prepares for a visit to london we pass over a good deal of a comic cast which is fairly executed but exceedingly inferior to the deeper parts of the book to which we now approach with rapidity wald receives the unexpected intelligence that katharine had been deserted by her husband and had disappeared and by one of those strange accidents which never occur anywhere but in novels and not in the best of thee either the lodginghouse of

evelyn innes by george moore fisher unwin we have an immense respect for mr george moore as a novelist tris patience his laboriousness his remarkable fidelity to the artistic light that is in him are rare and invaluable qualities in an age of facile production and ready compromise starting we should say with almost no initial equipment of genius for fiction he has worked his way by sheer dogged perseverance to a manner of expression and a point of view which though they may excite discussion cannot at least fail to rivet attention and enchain interest neither the expression nor the point of view indeed is or is likely to be in any ultimate sense personal to shake off critical preoccupations and to see absolutely for himself seems to be an impossible thing for mr moore but if you compare esther waters or evelyn innes whether for style or insight with some of the authors earlier work what an advance the student of human nature has acquired a real knowledge in some at least of the secret things of the heart the eye of the realist has been trained to discriminate and select to a perception of the significant instead of the obvious in the external shell of life and the pains devoted to mr moores style have not been without fruit verbal melody he generally misses grammatical correctnesssometimes there is no place in paris he will tell you  where you get abettor petite marmite than the ambassadeurs his sentences are frequently stiff and frequently jerky too short or too overloaded with coordination butand it is a big buthe has learned to paint to visualise to callup an image not of the outlines merely but of the atmosphere of a room of a garden of an environment here is one of fifty examples the broad walk was full of the colour of spring and its perfume the thick grass was like a carpet beneath their feet they had lingered by a pond and she had watched the little yachts carrying each a portent of her own success or failure the albert hall curved over tiie tops of the trees and sheep strayed through the deep may grass in arcadian peacefulness but the most vivid impression was when they had come upon a lawn stretching gently to the waters edge owen had feared the day was too cold for sitting out but at that moment the sun contradicted him with a broad warm gleam he had fetched two chairs from a pile stacked under a tree and sitting on that lawn swept by the shadow of softly moving trees they had talked an hour or more the scene came back to her as she sat looking into the fire she saw the spring easily victorious amid the low bushes capturing the rough branches of the elms one by one and the distant slopes of the park grey like a piece of faded tapestry and as in a tapestry the ducks came through the mist in long pulsing flight and when the day cleared the pea fowl were seen across the water sunning themselves on the high branches evelyn inns is an elaborate and minutely analytic study of the musical temperament the heroine is a singer of opera wagnerian opera she is one of those who as plato has it pipe away their souls in sweet and plaintive melodies her spiritual life is confined almost entirely to vague emotions and to such ideas as find their natural expression in musicideas very slightly intellectualised hardly raised above the level of sensations and emotions she drifts along through lifewith mr moore watching and studying her trying to disentangle and isolate the currents iii and out of a couple of liaisons and finally into the bosom of the holy catholic church precisely the same kind of mental processes determine her conversion as those which lead her out of the arms of one lover and into those of another this is the spirit of it   then to rid herself of the remembrance she thought of the joy she had experienced that morning at hearing in the creed that gods kingdom shall never pass away her soul had kindled like a flame and she had praised god crying to herself  thy kingdom shall last for ever and ever it had seemed to her that her soul had acquired kinship over all her faculties over all her senses for the time being it had ruled her utterly and so delicious was its subjection that she had not dared to move lest she should lose this sweet peace her lips had murmured au  our father but so slowly that the sanctus bell had rung before she had finished it nothing troubled her and the torrent of delight which had flowed into and gently overflowed her soul had intoxicated and absorbed her until it had seemed to her that there was nothing further for her to desire the interest of mr moores analysis is undeniable although we own to finding it a trifle too subjective and monotonous the young ladyjs fluctuations carry one rather often over the same ground and we fancy that a broader touch would have enabled mr moore to produce a really more vivid effect the background of the book is filled up with musical discussion skilfully designed to bring into contrast the two sides of music which attach it to the sensual life and the life of devotion respectively we do not presume to sound the depths of mr moores musical lore but we are not surprised that in dulwich  none remembered that dowlands was the name of henry the eighths favourite luteplayer surely his name was dowland and himself a contemporary not of henry but of elizabeth  evelyn innes by georsre moore fisher unwin  evelyn innes it may be remarked at the outset is the best novel which mr moore has yet written in grasp of character and in power of portraying an individual living being mr moore has advanced even since  esther waters of which the best characteristic was the presentation of the heroine but here still more one has the feeling that one is face to face with a reality and that evelyns actions have that inevitableness without which no interest is possible although this novel just as much as its predecessor is a novel with a topic music taking the place of betting as the phase of life on which the fortunes of the characters chiefly depend one is never made to feel that a single incident in the heroines life or a turn in her character is due to any desire on the part of the author to prove a point or elucidate a theory music is the real atmosphere in which evelyn and the other characters live and work out their destinies it is not as is so often the case in novels with a purpose the rarefied atmosphere of the philosopher making experiments on semianimate puppets to have studied music ancient and modern with the care and exactitude here displayed by the author and to have avoided the fault of allowing his subject to overpower his sense of character is in itself a great achievement and all praise is due to him for it but in awarding this praise one almost unconsciously stumbles across what spoils so much of mr moores work it is a great achievement but in almost everything that he does one is more impressed with the difficulty of his task and the labour required to surmount it than with the success great though it may be of his endeavours mr moore somewhere tells a story about himselfin the  confessions of a young man if we remember rightwhich seems to illustrate this characteristic in all his works when he first went to the louvre he tells us he saw no beauty in ingress  la source but manet or some painter whom he admired told him that it was beautiful convinced that his informant was right he went day after day to this picture to study it and find out wherein its beauty consisted until at last after a vast amount of conscientious study he really did find that the picture was most beautiful so in all his work one has a feeling that he is very often right and has attained to the end required but that it has cost him an unconscionable amount of trouble and study to attain it and he seems so proud of all the pains he has been at that he will not spare the reader any of the steps of the journey to his goal mr moore never seems to live anything if we may so put it he always studies it and learns it he has no intuition but he joins to great intelligence extraordinary laboriousbess which secures him the power of rarely making a mistake and as rarely enlightening by a flash of inspiration even with evelyn innes the most living and successful of his characters this may be observed she certainly is a living woman all her actions are perfectly right from her own nature but she is always an outsider a person to be observed not felt of all the greatest characters in fictionjane austens some of thackerays dickenss mr merediths it may be said that not only does the author seem to have lived them but the reader almost can identify himself with them and feel himself saying and doing what they say and do with evelyn inns mr moore may have been on terms of the most intimate acquaintance but he never felt himself in her and the reader also feels that what she does is quite natural from what he knows of her character just as he feels about his cousin or his aunt but he never realises her sufficiently to feel that he would necessarily do the same himself she is really living but she is not living in the most intimate way with though same limitations sir owen asher and ulick dean are wonderfully good up to a certain point they are people one would recognise immediately if one met them in the streetin fact one knows many like them but mr moores art adds nothing to our knowledge of them they are to a certain extent enigmas in life as all men are except perhaps one besides oneself and to just that extent and no less are they enigmas in the novel a consequence of mr moores inability to conceal his laborious methods is that however interesting in some respects his novels may be they are apt to become tiresomely prolix mr moor is crammed full of facts one may imagine him like zola studying for his novels from every available source as zola would have gone he has evidently been to bayreuth and to madame wagners house there he has studied the scores of wagners operas and wagner literature ad nauseam he has been to dulwich and to hyde park and kensington gardens  he has conscientiously paced every inch of the ground which he makes his characters cover but unlike zola he has not acquired the faculty of discarding unnecessary facts the frenchman knows as all frenchmen do that one of the first elements of art is to know when to be silent but mr moore will tell you that evelyn paid her hansom cabman when she left him he will weary you with discussions on wagner and bring in utterly irrelevant disquisitions on balzac in one passage he describes at some length a subscription concert got up by evelyn and in reading the description we wondered if he would add the exact amount secured by it for the charity and sure enough it was duly chronicled this is the reason why some reviewers cry out against disgusting passages in mr moores books now in this one there are some details which could certainly not be qualified as disgusting but which are absolutely unnecessary and which one would prefer not to have mentioned unless there were some very strong dramatic reason for doing so which there is not they are annoying here chiefly because they are so gratuitously unnecessary just as some of his long and inappropriate descriptions of scenes are tiresome they are only worse than the latter because they concern matters on which it is better to be reticent but their real fault is essentially the same that of irrelevance the book however which is worth criticising at such length just because it is so good as a whole and so admirably single in purpose and construction and so marvellous in the way in which all the interest is quite naturally focussed on the heroine must not be dismissed on a reproach the style though still a little lacking in nerve and decision is a great improvement on mr moores former writing and some of his phrases and jottings of character are decidedly pithy and poignant here is perhaps the best of them   lady ducklo appeared to her as one who had never selected a road she seemed to have walked a little way on all roads and her face expressed a life of many wanderings straying from place to place there was nothing as she said worth doing which she had not done but she had clearly accomplished nothing  evelyn innes when sir owen the artistic baronet begins evelyns education seriously in paris one of his first lessons is in balzac  there is a vulgarity he says to her  about those who dont know balzac we his worshippers recognise in each other a refinement of sense and a peculiar comprehension of life we are beings apart we are branded with the seal of that great mind you should hear us talk among ourselves further he says that each of balzacs fiftytwo volumes is a masterpiece now mr moores general methods in fiction do not forbid us to infer that through sir owens mouth he is expressing his own views at all events this personage does express views which mr moore has uttered in his own name such balzacian fanaticism one would hesitate to attribute to him were it not that his manner of working here and elsewhere convicts him of it for a dilettante baronet blind fanaticism is of no consequence but when one of the writingcraft forgets that the honour due to such an incomparable searcher of the human mind must be discriminate in order to be worthy the case is serious for imitation is bound to follow and it so happens that only balzacs weaknesses can be imitatedhis   evelyn innes by george moore 6s unwin formlessness his unjustified and unforgiveable loagxears his unrelieved monotony of manner the admiration for the masters genius has given to the native defects and misfortunes of mr moores talent the shelter and encouragement of a great name mr moore is sometimes reputed to be a dangerous writer but if he sins he does not sin lightly or insinuatingly let that be counted to his credit where it may he admires ciany french things and has learned some part of his craft in a french school yet never englishman was so deadly serious in manner at least there is not a smile anywhere in  evelyn innes not a vivaciousmovement not an unconsidered word but surely he must drive the most unsympathetic reader to unstinted admiration of the work he puts into his books when one compares the quantity and the quality with that which contents most of our novelists one is filled with the highest respect his ideal is that every character should be quite completely presented from the inner recesses of his soul xr george moore frous 4 pakinuis by maxet rproduced by kuxd permission oj musm waiter scott lal to the shape of his boots that of every opinion held by his personages he should be the historian and interpreter capable of writing a leading article on it that every scene should have the local definiteness of modern stage directions that every street or house should be precisely entered in a full catalogue or inventory and he hardly falls short of that ideal with magnificent patience and honest slogging endeavour is his task pulled through when he has to get up a subject he does so without flimsiness this latest novel for instance should be a mine of interest to students of the older music and to admirers of mr dolmetsch his wagner criticism is able and suggestive and of course very timely at the present moment unquestionably he has a rare and admirable respect for his work about the result there will be much difference of opinion to me his manner and method are unpleasing and the abnegation of all art and i feel it much more in  evelyn innes than ia  esther waters where the form and temper were more flaubertianand flaubert if a  little master is a safer guide for mr moore than balzac who tempts him to longwindedness but still he has only exaggerated the course which his kind of temperament his quality of vision must have forced him to take at his best lie is an unsurpassed photographer and as such should he be judged monsignor and his surroundings the wimbledon convent the intense and rather shabby audience at mr innes concerts are masterpieces of the camera only when he is forced to alter some important circumstance of his scenes and sitters le blunders the book is in some degree a romax a clef ulick dean will be widely recognised the ceavexaxces demand that some veil should be thrown over his identity and mr moore makes him a musician he is not 1 transposed  enough what has a musician to do with all those interesting imaginings and philosophies  and evelyn  sir owen told her she was  intensely balzacian very likely the creator of eugenie grandet might have made her comprehensible nothing could be more detailed and more superficially definite than her history as given by mr moore but she is a blur to one careful reader at least at the beginning she lives a shabby and obscure life without ambition though she knows she has a great voice then she agrees to a lse with sir owen a little for love perhaps not a little for fine clothes and fine living and a little for the sake of her voice sir owen gives her rationalistic instruction which does not enter deep into her system she becomes a great singer of great partsisolde kundry briinnhilde then she falls under the more spiritual influence of ulick but his mysticism does not satisfy her then with a thought to her soul she gives up the stage in the midst of her triumph in her convent retreat we think her fate is settled at last but no she comes out into the world again quite aimless what is she meant to be  one leaves her with the idea that she was very stupidbut stupid as are those sensitivists on whom scientific hypnotists experiment most successfully yet we gather that mr moore had some other intention in presenting herthat to him she was a rersonality something has missed his nervous subject fdgeted under the fire of the camera a m  literary bulletin books eviryx inure bv gforrf njoorf fishcer litwin s mr george moore is still a realist he still gives us too much detail and will not trust to the imagination of his reader but he has put aside the coarser and more unpleasant aspects of his manner evelyn inns is a great opera singer who falls under the influence firstly of the agnostic and man of the world secondly of the mystic whose religion is art and thirdly of the priest she is frankly sensual and pleasureloving with her religious feeling is only a sublimated exercise of the senses it can only be maintained through an entire submission to authority and dogma and we are led to suppose that she finds an answer to her needs in the roman catholic church but mr moure leaves our curiosity on this point really ungratified and we hope he may he preparing a

tallangetta the squatters home a story ofj australian life bv william howitt 2 vols longman  co the preface to these volumes is a singular example of absurdity mr howitt intensely satisfied with his own performance volunteers for the benefit of the reader a statement in behalf of a class of persons calling themselves or called by their dupes spiritualists he introduces a spiritualist or hat and tableturner into this story of australian life and endeavours to justify a stageeffect so monstrous by flinging a modest sneer at prof faraday and bursting into a digression on communications with departed friends the rosicrucian mysteries of friar bacons brazen head and a certain american poet who has written things  among the finest since shelley and byron we will not quote the passage that follows to use a phrase of mr howitts it is  smoke from a plea for the irrational he advances by no natural process to a panegyric upon himself this is honest enough we are gratified to learn that  a distinguished officer in victoria said  mr howitts volumes are not like the colonythey are the colony itself but it is more than amusing to find a long and somewhat ridiculous letter from a gentleman who has never seen australia transcribed as a still more remarkable testimony to the impressions of verisimilitude with every willingness to credit mr howitt as an accurate reporter upon life and realities in the land of gold we cannot accept as  remarkable testimony the opinion of a novelist who had merely  read some thirty books about that country and found mr howitts  infinitely the best quitting the illconsidered and undignified preface we find in the novel a rather commonplace story garnished with pictures at once vivid and simple of colonial life especially among the squatters we have in fact a nearer view of character and manners among the pastures and diggings than was afforded in the two years in victoria mr howitt opens his tale well and in a way to excite an immediate interest the curtain rises upon an old english family wrongfully deprived of its possessions journeying into the interior of australia to live at a station  until things take a new turn the new turn is taken in due course and the curtain descends upon the same family restored to england and to its rightful inheritance the interval is filled with scenes in cities and by flood and field in the colonyrevolving however round tallangetta where the delicate squatters create a temporary home mr howitt paints a gallery of special portraits and does his best to illustrate the kind of life led under such circumstances in australia aa well as the human idiosyncrasies to be encountered  as dr spenser grayson the poetdr woolstan the spiritualistand mr flavel the seer not to repel the reader by dwelling upon these grotesque imaginings we will extract a passage from a trial scene in which mr howitts manner and the nature of his story are exemplified a young man charged with murder is at the bar an eccentric witness in his favour randall has been badgered by the counsel for the prosecution   sir said randall  i have answered you many questions that have nothing whatever to do with the cause at issue and now your position shall not protect you i throw myself on the justice of the court on the impartial spirit of my countrys laws i insist that you answer me one question you have dared to probe my life and endeavoured to blast my reputation before the worldanswer me thiswhat did your father say when at your vehement and repeated solicitation he granted you a last secret interview beneath the banshee oak in dunallen park the haughty lawyer stood arrested at that question as by a supernatural blow which turned him to a statue he appeared petrified by astonishment my father the banshee oak he stammered yes your father the banshee oak said randall outwardly calm yet plainly and justly incensed your father the venerable loni dunallen do you not see him said the homelylooking squatter rising as if inspired and pointing to a particular part of the court all eyes uicludmg those of the terrorstricken lawyer mechanically following his finger do you not see him now leaning on his cane shaken by grief as by a palsy and his bare white head gleaming in the moonlight as he says solemnly you have banished your brother you have killed your mother by a broken heart you have disgraced your family you have deceived and left utterly desolate your father who now stands here alone before god in his age may you repent repent for rather would i see you lying dead on that bod than that the people of the dunallen estates should ever fall into your power in your present unchristian unregenerate temper there was a sensation throughout the court as if a thunderbolt had fallen on it a deathlike silence prevailed and the proud counsel who so lately had born down all before him by his talent and audacity suddeidy dropped on his seat with his head on the table and was even sliding to the floor when some of the other counsel caught him and had him born from the court the sensation throughout the crowd was inconceivable no words could describe it people lawyers all present sprung to their feet all sense of order was lost there was one loud buzz of voices expressing amazement at this most singular occurrence and numbers hastening out to gain further intelligence of the stricken down man at length the officers of the court restored some degree of attention the judge wonderfidly affected rose and summed up compelled several times to pause for composure and when he dismissed the jury to consider their verdict they almost instantly by their foreman pronounced clear and loud the words not guilty this is a melodrama but it is effectively worked up and is a specimen of mr howitts narrative style in description he is more felicitous take this sketch of the diggings twenty thousand people at least were all scuffling together like ants in an ants nest or tadpoles in a pool the whole valley through which ran the creek or brook for several miles was in the act of being turned upside down close as the crowd could press upon each other so as to leave the prescribed number of feet for each party they were digging delving throwing up earth carrying away bags of it supposed to contain the gold to the creek and there delivering it to other crowds who at a long fine of cradles were in as great a bustle throwing in the earth rocking it to and fro under deluges of water from tin dippers there was an incessant noise of rattling cradles and shouting voices strange figures all yellow with clay and disguised in bushy beards and veils to keep off the flies seemed too desperately busy to have time to breathe it was all one agitated scene of elbowing swearing hacking hewing and shovelling not a tree was left standing over the whole great space and the sim flamed down on unsheltered heaps and holes of gravel with a burning sweltering force

  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival,englishfiction

a diplomatic woman short stories by huan mee  sands  cothe pseudonym adopted on the titlepage of 4 a diplomatic woman  probably conceals a brace of authors on the cover is depicted a woman and it is as ugly a decoration as anything in bookcovers we have lately seen and that says much six stories within tell of six different adventures in which this singularly plain parisienne is involved she is supposed to be a reigning beauty and to be in the confidence if not in the pay of premiers ministers attaches and suchlike persons the episodes are recounted in the first person and the tone and manner are unfortunately not calculated to give the wished for impression of elegance and distinction french quotations and expressions are numerous but many of these are more incorrect or less well applied than should be the case in high diplomatic circles the intrigues are now and then ingenious but entirely charmless always bad characters abound in the volume entitled the naked trwh und other stories by andrew merry new century press and leave a distinctly disagreeable taste behind them there are five of these stories and they are clever and suggestive of careful study of the best french models of the day it is not easy to avoid the impression that sombre subjects are more suited to the writers pen than those of cheerful characteristics the first one which gives its name to the collection describes a married woman and her lovers one of whom cannot understand why there should be others besides himself and he cannot see that he is neither the first nor the last he neglects his wife and drinks no doubt there are many such men and women and their story is not new to fiction however it bears retelling and it is well told the rest are not unlike the first piece in subject and treatment they describe the lives of those who dwell in cities especially the more unhappy of them perhaps the writer would be equally clever in describing happier things  and if so some such feature would hardly be out of place if only by way of contrast,englishfiction
the wile o1 alaamont by violet hunt  heinemann it is regrettable that miss hunt who has an admirable command of the english language and whose characterization is incisive and vigorous should show an icresing tendency to waste these good gifts upon irredeemably sordid material in her new book not only the conventions but also the decencies of life are outraged with a cynicism which is really toowholesale to be effective betsey altamont because she admires his mother marries the illegitimate son of sir joris veere whom he subsequently murders betsey rejoicing frankly that her husband will be hanged yet takes his mistress and children to live with her in the keep of her admirers castle where he is entertaining his fianc6e and a party of the latters smart friends ernest rose veere is a nephew of the murdered man and that he treats betsey with fundamental respect rather it appears from pique than chivalry and ultimately marries her is slight if any amelioration to the long chain of preposterous situations which compose the story the characters are all cleverly drawn but are not attractive the heroine is no doubt intended to have charm but it is not of a kind which will appeal to the average reader,englishfiction

say things which are usually unsaid and to deal with a theme which with all deference to the authoress i think she had much better have abstained from handling there are only three characters to speak of in the booksir richard calmady his mother and his cousin the other figures which crowd the stage are of no account and of the three the cousin mme helen de vallorbes is the most conspicuous and the least pleasant it is not a pleasant story at all and those who wish for entertainment and amusement had better avoid it it is a study of life under morbid and unnatural conditions in this respect it suggests reminiscences of  lhomme qui rit for the hero is a man blighted from birth with the curse of physical defect in  notre dame victor hugo also touches upon the same gruesome theme but lucas malet deals with this matter in her own fashion the story is cry simple the history of sir richard calmady begins some months before he was born his father having his leg smashed by a horse in his stable died under theamputationthat followed his legswcrecutoffat the knee in the days of charles ii the illegitimate son of sir thomas calmady an ancestor of sir richard had also lost his nether extremities his unnatural father having driven over the child as they came from the church where he had been marrying another woman the deserted mistress with the mangled and dying child in her arms had cursed the calmadys to the sixth and seventh generation declaring that as the judgement of his perfidy and lust no son of brockhurstthe calmady estateshould reach the lifelimit set by the psalms

and his mother it was discovered that as the result of his fathers accident the child was born without any legs but with feet fastened on to the end of his thighs his mother lady calmady who is painted in ideal colours as the most marvellous and devoted of mothers was filled with profound remorse at the effect which her own emotion has produced upon her child she dedicates herself to him and brings him up bravely sir richard himself is represented as almost human perfection cut short at the kneehandsome stately wellformed possessing in every respect an ideal physique with the exception of his shorn extremities the result of the feet being planted on to the extremities of the thighs rendered it impossible for him to be furnished with artificial limbs hence he could only hobble about in a more or less hideous fashion the first half of the book is devoted to a description of how the poor boy thus marred from birth grows up and suffers keenly at every turn from those slights from which   the history of sir richard calniady by lucas malet london metnuen and co 6i8 pages price 6s all his mothers loving care could not shield him his first love affair when little more than a boy was a passion of great devotion for his cousin the heroine and villain of the piece as children they had met when she had spoken jeeringly to his mother of the poor cripples deformity his mother blazing with indignation had flung the child from her path and ordered her to leave the house the little girl had fallen against the wall and inflicted a scar upon her forehead which caused her to regard lady calmady with undyinghatred in her childish wrath she vowed to be revenged and she kept her word returning afterwards when she had made a more or less unhappy marriage she fascinated sir richard who placed his fortune at her disposal with a knightly chivalry declaring that it was all he could do his mother nearly breaks her heart over the lads passion for his cousin but it passes and they agree to marry him to a little english girl of title not so much from any love on his part as from a desire to perpetuate the family and that he may have a son the girl recoils at the last moment from marrying the truncated suitor and sir richard thereupon maddened and despairing determined to have his fling and go to the devil he declares he will go the common way of common coarsegrained sensual men and be of this world worldly he saysi am going to have just all that my money and position and even this wild deformityfor by god i will use that too  what people wont give for love they will give for curiositycan tring me of pleasure and notoriety i am going to lay hold of life with these rather horribly strong arms of mine strong as a young bull apes i mean to tear the very vitals out of living to tear knowledge excitement intoxication out of it making them by right of conquest my own as i cannot have a wife i will have mistresses as i cannot have honest love i will have gratified lust my imagination has been stimulated into rather dangerous activity by the prenatal insult put upon me and now that i have emancipated myself i propose to apply my imagination practically he is as good as his word and he embarks upon a wild career of debauchery and unnatural and morbid vice in the midst of it all he still cherishes love for helen his cousin whom in spite of the wreck of all his other gods he continues to cherish in a secret temple of his own as the one pure woman in the world in reality she is a veritable messalina although as the authoress says in a sentence of almost unique coarseness in modern novels the artist was at least as present in her as the whore and to the delineation of this great courtesan with fine aesthetic appreciations and inevitable animality lucas malet devotes herself with a minutenessof analysis much more frequently found in french than in english novels for some reason or other lucas malet appears to be fascinated by this shepanther of a woman she paints her minutely in almost every phase of emotion she describes the woman with the licentious city of naples as a background deliberately laying her snares and completing her arrangements to lure her cousin to his undoing it is not often that in english fiction there is a picture drawn at full length and in vivid colours of the way of a strange woman with the man whom she has marked down for her victim and what makes the thing all the more horrid is the emphasis which lucas malet lays upon the effect of physical deformity as an incentive to sensual desire in the midst of a scene in which helen was plying all her arts in order to fire calmadys blood sir richard had to move his positionshe stared fascinated by that cruel spectacle for the instant transformation of the apparently tall and conspicuously wellfavoured courtly gentleman just now sitting at table with her into this shuffling longarmed crippled dwarf was at first utterly incredible then portentous then by virtue of its very monstrosity absorbing and to her adorable whetting appetite as veritable famine might chastity became to her more than ever absurd a culpable waste of her own loveliness of sensation of emotion a sin against those vernal influences working in this generous nature surrounding her and working in her own blood all the primitive instinct of her womanhood called aloud in her that she must wedmust wed and the strident voice of the great painted city coming up to her urgent incessant carried the same message as did the radiant sea whose white lips kissed the indented coastline as though pale and hungry with love while the nan before her by his very abnormality and a certain secretness inevitable in that heightened her passion he was to her of all living men most desirable so that she must win him and hold him must see and know of course the inevitable result follows she held this man in the hollow of her hand by right divine of beauty wit and the manifold seductions of her richly endowed personality this of her many loves was the crown and the climax as the adulteress hunts for the precious life so this lithe shepanther tracked down her prey and triumphed without remorse in the satisfaction of her revenge and the consummation of her desire like her prototype in the book of proverbs she ate and drank and said  i have done no evil it is very different with her victim calmady who had wilfully trampled under foot all canons of morality and was shocked back into virtue by the sudden destruction of his last ideal  the last of mv selfmade gods he told her has indeed gone overboard he fled from the scene of his undoing took refuge on board his yacht but venturing out feverstricken to attend the opera he was again tracked down by his conqueror who came to him in his box and vowed her determination never to leave him  richard she said very softly laying her hand lightly upon his thighi forgive all i am not satisfied with loving i will come with you i will stay with you i will be faithful to you yes yes even that your love is unlike any other it is unique as you yourself are unique i want more of it  her lips were parted in naughty laughter and then not without a shrinking of quick horror richard beheld the soul in herthat being of lovely proportions exquisitely formed in every part yet black as the foul liquid lanes between the hulls of the money ships dowvn in naples harbourstep delicately in between those parted lips returning whence it came he refused to go with her whereupon she summoned a former lover into the box who struck richard again and again across the face with his metalbuttoned gloves calmady tried to strike him and fell heavily stunning himself as his temples struck the lower step of the descent from the back of the box the man kicked calmady as he lay asking  dear madame are you sufficiently avenged is it enough helen expressed herself satisfied and the two went out into the blackness of the dark night the third part of the book describes the regeneration of sir richard calmady the fever possessed him and he came for a time near to the door of death he was nursed back by his mother who rejoiced to welcome back the prodigal who had found the husks which the swine did eat so very bitter to his taste sir richards repentance was genuine and final his mother had the satisfaction of finding for him an excellent wife from whom he conceals nothing either of his deformities or of his lapses from the straight path her acceptance of him is characteristic and somewhat original  for heavens sake she said  dont take me out of pity i would never forgive you there is a good deal of us both one way and another and we should give each other a hell of a time if i was in love and you were not butshe put her hand on the peak of that very ugly saddle again but if you do care here i am i am yours body and soul marry me she said having made up her mind to accept him she found that his crippling was dearer to her than any other mans wholeness and his wrongdoings dearer than any other mans virtue what wve wonder wvould people think if a man were to say such a thing to a woman like helen everything goes so well that in the last page he tells his mother he is thankful that she brcught him into the world even as he was which was good for the most perfect of mothers to hear speaking of the book as a whole no one can deny its ability or the nerve of its authoress  but whether it is a book which makes altogether for edification is a question upon which readers will probably agree to differ whatever other significance it has it undoubtedly marks a definite stride forward across the barriers which have hitherto differentiated the english from the french novel

if sinners entice tltee by william lo qucux white  co ir is impossible to regard this novel as satisfactory of course mr le queux writes well when he describes life and scenery at nice and on the riviera for as we have remarked on other novels written by him he is painstaking and careful unfortunately his last published work suggests that ho has devoted his enorgy to though manufacture of artificial personalities who move like puppets through a conventional drama there is a mysterious murder at the end of the second chapter though heavy father of the early victorian stage is found fortunately only on his doathbod the conventional foreign nobleman duly appears as the complete villain and the virtuous love of a young man and a maiden is ultimately rewarded with marriage title and money one seems to have read it all before many a time from 4 the woman in white to the day before yesterday and yet the familiar dish is by no means badly served the gamingtables of monaco and the gamblers last stake are at least as well described as we have known them of old and a reference to the yachts britannia and ailsa shows how recently the picture was painted it is not quite clear why the villain should be described as having an arrestive face for the epithet adds nothing to our appreciation of his familiar features the minor characters are unusually well sketched we shall hope to see a better story from mr le queux in the near future,englishfiction
  the actormanager by leonard merrick grant richards as a tale of the english stage of today mr merricks story is to be commended it is well contrived and it is not disagreeable to read the dramatis persona are kept within narrow limits and there is no difficulty in grasping the individuality of each that the best work in art only appeals to the minority and in the form of newly written drama will not  pay seems to be the moral of the story that the actormanager should be unhappy in his marriage and that a cleverer actress than his wife should carry out his ideas are features which serve to complete the sketch of the plot it is not the best of mr merricks novels but it is well told one phrase is a little odd as ho recognised her attraction it was noetic and no more the word we have italicised might be a misprint for neurotic or even poetic  the actormanager by lionard merrck iu grant richards the english stageworld of today has never teen treated in more detail than in mr merricks able story the minor actors are presened to you as well as the iltars you sce the dramatist struggling for a hearing and then watch his triumphant success the temptations of a manager with ideals above the demands of the public the temptations of an actordramatist u ith ideals above the sordid ambitions of his wife are suggested in a way to draw forth much sympathetic interest from the reader perhaps the stagewcrld is no more romantic than other milieus but described in this realistic and uptodate manner it has the advantage of novelty for most of us those to whom all the theatrical circumstance is commonplace will still find a charm in the actormanager this charm proceeds from mr merricks loyal and simj leminded attitude to men and things,englishfiction

the cost of a secret the cost of a secret is a novel written evidently by an author of refinemnent and imagination and its faults are precisely those which are oftenest found united with considerable imaginative power novels may be divided like all other productions of artistic minds into two classes and belong either to the ideal or to the realistic school the minute delineation of life and manners that we get so frequently in novels of the day is more fatiguing and less pleasant than the ideal and even shadowy conceptions given to us by more dreamy and poetical writers we live in a dust and a noisy age and to educated readers whose path through fife lies in a crowd and in a throng it is a relief to escape into a volume  the cost of a secret b the author of  4aga tror ia thmv ol

great difficulty withl which a writer has to contend who belongs to tile more fanciful land romantic school is this that it is not easy to depict character oln a ilaroe and a romantic scale when tile figures can after all be figures of iiien alnd women only the classical artist raises them above the earth by laying the scene of ac tion eithler inl heaven or at least ill that mysterious mythical ge of heroes and demigods the personages of which were surrounded with an indistinct and romantic grandeur it was something more thnm human sorrow which spoke to the greek in the person of an antigone or anl edipus nor was there any dangner of the plot of the story being of necessity either vulgrar on the one hand or improbable and extravagant upon the other a modern author has no such resources as were vouchsafed by the peculiar circulmstances of the age to the classical poet or mythologist he is anxious to tfl from all imitation of common life and in shunning scylla he falls into charybdis he paints men and women for he call paint nothing else  and in endeavouring to remove them fromn the everydav level of comnmon things he often miakcs his plut unnatural improbable and absurdc the effect

positions which have no parallel oln eartlh his groups are admirable balt the lights and shadows are overdone and the backg round is a background constructed upon untenable assumptions which seem to do violence to our experience and to conltradict all that we have ever heard or seen wise indeed is the rare and happy novelist who in such a dilemma refrains from mixing in these impossible proportions the idleal and the real and confines himself to making the interest of his piece turn entirely upon the internal play of the feelings or at least upon the siniple and picturesque grouping of the figures rthe more common error is that of the author whose personages and characters charm us by their grace and their truth so loing as they stand still but when they move and act act in violation of the ordinary laws of probability and social experience it is seldom that the reader of fiction comes upon a threevolume novel in which there is as much to please and as little to offend as is to be found in  the cost of a secret the conceptions of character ill it are graceful and refined  nor are the heroes and heroines built in aniy except a truthful mould with the exception of the deus 0 mtackind of the tale a certain ai corsand whose virtues perhaps verge upon the superhuiiian the other male and female characters possess the rare advantage of being at one and the same time both naturally and elegrantly drawn the literary part of the book is done beyond all question well  and on arriving at the close we can feel that in point of taste there has not been a blemish through the whole like agnes trenmorne a novel by the same hand the cost of a secret is framed oln a classical model and by classical fingers both tales belong to the gallery of art in which stand the creations of some of the best modern writers of the classical school but  the cost of a secret has a fault which will not be found in the exjuisite productions of such a novelist as the author of  tranlsformation that the plot should be unreal is not in itself an insuperable objection but the plot which in reality is improbable and unreal is meant beyond all doubt for a plot of real life and as such it provokes a criticism and an investigation which it is unable successfully to bear the merit of the tale would have been greater but for this had the author been contented with elaborating quietly the different admirable characters that had been put upon the scene without introducing them to an impossible complication of circumstances  the cost of a secret might have lost something but it would have gained even more the author was afraid of being dull and determined apparently to create an interest fromn the story itself independently of the characters of the story nor can it be said that the object has been altogether unattained the secret is somewhat transparent and a curious inquirer might discover the key sooner perhaps than the author imagines but the thread of narrative is on the whole well sustained andon the assumption that the narrative was possible at allwould be calculated to interest and pklease unfortunately this assumption is untenable the plan is too fanciful to be hunman there have been nien and women like the men and women we meet in  the cost of a secret and they have been clhriuinir men and women but inever were nmen and women placed in so singular and unlikely a position as that in which the characters o f  trhe cost of a secret  have been placed by its refined nd ind genious author it is owing doubtless to thle imaginative tendlency of the author that all the heroes and heroines of the story are irawn ill some picturesque light or other and never stand except in ain artistic attitiide the authtlor seems to look on them not merely

to play second fiddle to another paragon of virtue is a trying ordeal for a husband and allowances should be inmade for the unhappy gerard clayre which the author seems reluctant to make it is the old story of the painter and the lion if the lion had been allowed to tell the story perhaps he would have told it differently with this protest in favour of ml clavre we are content to leave the conduct

herd boy which in the titlepaife she tells us is a very superior work and has been read by the itors of the london magazine with much interest as we have not been s0 fortunate as our brother journalists we shall not dispute the correctness of their judgment especially as the  scottish orphans gives us a very favourable opinion of the talents of its author the tale relates to a family who were out in the fortyfive that is participating in the rebellion of 145 the father of the scottish orphans was executed at carlisle as a rebel  his wife sunk under the grief of her situation and died a few days before the execution of her husband  the three orphans who had been imprisoned with tilt ir parents were rescued by an old domestic of the family who brought tlieuiupinsecresy until the eldest having obtained the patronage of a gentleman who had come to live in the neighbourhood procured a commission in the army andbut we know no more for here the tale abruptly terminates waiting till the fair author has leisure to furnish a second part of the history for the consolation however of such as mav feel uneasy respecting the fate of the orphans mrs blackford kindly assures us of their contilined prosperity and that the veil of mystery which hangs over this part of the narrative will then be removed although their tale is not complete vet it will be read with interest as conm  taming a very pleasing narrative and iiculeatinijf the best of moral duties he shall make one extract relating to the rescuing the orphans from prison by the servant william mathieson   the moment william thought he could speak without being heard he informed mr monteith heiad learned that an order for his removal had been given and that in two days he feared he would lie taken from stirling on his way to england to be tried af carlisle  that he had discovered that colonel monteith had had interest enough to be allowed to detain the children under the pretence of taking care of them and that strict orders had been given to the governor of the castle not to salier them or mrs monleitli to cpiit the prison till after his reuval  but my dear good master continued william seeing mr monteith

shall follow in a cart xvith the baby i hopi to be clear of the neighbourhood of stirling before six oclock and once a few miles on my xvay all fears of detection are at an end 1 have likcxvise sir thought that if you would make the attempt it is not impossible that you might be able to escape by the xvindow yourself but to do it xviii require more time than between this and tomorrow morning as you xviii be obliged to remove at least two of the iron bars to make the opening large enough for you to get through  j xvould therefore advise you to send the children at once and if m the course of tomorroxv vou are so fortunate as to succeed in loosening tlu bars you can in the evening endeavour to let yourself doxvn from the window and escape to my sisters house at the end of the bridge where you must remain till i return from edinbiugh  and then xve may bc able to contrive some method of getting vou on board of a ship and out of the country as quickly as possible  mr monteith shook his

risking and you may depend on finding me ready at the hour you have mimed to attempt to put the plan in execution  william endeavoured to persuade his master to attempt his own deliverance but mr monteith felt convinced that instant death must be the consequence if he did so and the fear of adding to his poor xvi fes sufferings by making her a witness to such a dreadful catastrophe weighed against all the arguments his faithful servant could urge and when the jailor summoned wiliam from the presence of his master he xva fenced to leave the prison without having the slightest hope of being able to save bim   mr monteith communicated to his j xvife so much of xvhat w iiiiaui had told  him as reconciled her to tiie plan of iel  ting the children down irom the window william ha i

bis hand and a fexv minutes before william appeared he had the satisfaction of removing it sufficiently to permit the largest of the boys to get through  the moment this xvas accomplished mis monteith began to prepare the children though the agony she endured both from parting xvith them for the lirt time in her life aud from the danger he could not help seeing they ran in eae of any unforeseen accident happening to tlu rope during tiieir descent rendered her scarcely able to complete her task mr monteith xvas not much more composed himself as he lirnily believed whauxer might be his success in letting them down safely he was now parting from them for the last time the two youngest allen and jessie xvere too young to be at all aware of xvhat xvas passing allen being little more than two

paul gossletts confessions these  confessions  attracted some attention while they were passing through the st pauls magazine conducted by mr trollope but for our own part we never ventured on anything like a bold guess at the authorship once or twice indeed we were on the point of exclaiming  aut diabolus aut charles lever  and the book still reminds us of the latter more than of any other living writer but why if it were from his pen should it be issued in this queer quiet way  however the  confessions  will make the readers of them laugh very heartily and though there are only two real attempts at sketching character while the whole thing is as slight as a farce and very much like one we fancy that nobody who makes paul gossletts acquaintance will forget his adventures in a hurry the story such as it is is a series of surprises of illluck which we shall certainly not do either the author or his readers the injustice of recounting in an abbreviated shape it is not a new idea but it is none the worse for that gil blas is on the whole a lucky dog from the time when he is sold by the gormandizing scamp at the hotel who informs him that he is the seventh wonder of the world to the  plant we hope to be excused for these vulgaritiesby don raphael and then onward to his misfortune with the bishop who could not bear to be told that his faculties were decaying though he had engaged gil blas expressly to warn him when they showed any symptoms of getting weaker gil blas has adventures of illluck which come upon us unexpectedly paul goeletts confessions  is not a story of character like  gil blas and it is as we have already said exceedingly slight but it does not contain a single surprise which is inferior as a surprise to the don raphael trick in gil blas this praise will not be misunderstood by our readers  gil blas  is a great novel and  paul gosslett  is a farce in the shape of a narrative but it is a farce of genins or something like it the style frequently runs into burlesque but there are numerous touches of humour which will be by no means obvious to inattentive readers and the book stands that difficult test of laughable writingyou can laugh at it more than once it would be quite idle to say to publishers  give up issuing long novels for railway reading and let us have more books like paul gosslett  to take into the train on a journey  because it is not everybody not even every humourist who can produce such books many men might have put as much fun within the same narrow compass150 pagesbut then very few men could have bound the fan up in such a series of naturallybroughtabout surprises and wound up with one more just for fun and when ordinary readers are dull or  full of nothing but vacancy as the irishman said they want to be carried forward by a succession of incidents however let us take a few samplessuch as will not affect the interest of the book to those who may buy itof the felicitous fooling of these iconfessions at the end of the story paul gosslett though as innocent paul goulettu confesions in love law and the idu saylc wm  illustration by maru stone london virtue  co afs a daisy finds himself

he might pollute it with dis honour who tracked his victim as the indian tracks his enemy from lair to lairsilent stealthily and with savage intensitynever falterjug from any momentary pang of conscience nor hesitating in his vile purpose from any passing gleam of virtue if this wretch stigmatised by nature with a rotten heart and branded by a name that will sound appropriately in the antala of crime fur he is called gosslett if all this and a great deal more in the same fashion is not familiar to the reader it is because he has not carefully studied the demosthenic orations of the court of arches the last clause is poor and commonplace but the absurdity of attaching a special odour of depravity to the bare word gosslett for he is called gosslett a name which if it suggests anything suggests the simple but virtuous gosling is a capital nonsequitur the quivoque of the loveletters of the lady who entrapped him is very amusing it must be understood that gosslett is at the head of a hydropathic establishment in germany and that mrs dacre who plays a part similar to that of the lady in the don raphael episode in gil blas  is a patient  if mrs dacres notes were very brief they were not less enig maticalsbe was the strangest writer that ever put pen to paper thus to give an instance the ice application she always referred to as  my coldness and she would say how long is your coldness to continue have i not had enough of it yet  this coldness is becoming tiresome and if it be continued how am i to go out with you  in another note referring to our intended drive she says i if it is a ques tion of running away i must have a word to say first for though i believe you have no fears on that ecre i am not so courageous virginie had been telling stories about my ponies they were frisky it is true and it was thus her mistress alluded to them some disparagement of me as a whip provoked this remark from her as the time draws newer i ask myself shall i trust myself to your guidance  who an say what may come of it   take a few passages from gossletts diary in that portion of his adventures which relates to love w why does the parish clerk always bring up a chicken when he comes with a me ts   lzzy did not own she made the beefateak dumpling but the maid seemed to let the secret out by bringing in a little amethyst ring she had forgotten on the kitchen table i wish she knew that id be glad she could make dumplings i am fond of dumplings to try and tell her this mrs d suspects lzzie is attached to me i dont think she approves of it d d would not object if i became an orangeman query what effect would that have on my future career could i b3 an orangeman without being able to sing the boyne water   for i never could hum a tune in my life to inquire about this who was the man who behaved badly to lizzy  and how did he behave badly  this is a very vital point though not easy to come at  18blizzy likes i may say loves me the avowal was made this morning when i was carrying up two pounds of sugar and one of soap from the village she said oh mr gosslett if you knew how unhappy i am   the notion of putting this down as an avowal of passion the criticism  this is a very vital point and the memorandum  to try and tell her this  i e that he is fond of dumplings are unctuously preposterous and yet how naturally they are jotted down but of course that is half the fun in all such humour under gossletts management the coldwatercure plan is of course a dead failure but see how he treats the intimation of the proposition that it must be closed as we had at this period eightyfour servants in the house sixteen horses in the stables and a staff of thirtytwo gardeners and boatmen not to speak of runners commissionaires and general loungers i was not amazed when a telegram came in these words close the house place dechworth in charge and come over to london to this i replied  telegram received compliance most undesirable autumn season just opening place in full beautypg  i will not weary the reader with a mere commercial wranglehow the committee reproached me and how i rejoined how they called names and i hinted at defamation how they issued an order for my dismissal and i demurred and demanded due notice we fbused each other all september and opened october in full cry of mutual attack and ddfenoe by this time too we were at law they applied for a mandamus to get rid of me and my counsel argued that i was without the four seas of the realm and could not be attacked i ney tried to reach me byr the statute of frauds but thee was ido treaty with nassau and i could not be touched all this contention and quarrelling was like suilpbate of quinine to mei grew robust and strong under the excitement and disoovered a lightness of heart and a buoyancy of nature i had believed had ljng left me for ever and though they stopped my salay and dishonoured mp drafts i lived on fruit and vegetables and put the garrison on the same diet with a liberal allowance of wine which more than reooniled them to tbh system the reader will gather for himself the fun of a flabbyminded man like paul gosslett su sidenly x developing  into energy and fat under the tonic influence of legal proceedings which he knew could never touch him earlier in the narrative when gossletts prospects are particulary gloomy he counts his money finds it just enough to bury him indulges in gloomy thoughts and weeps  i locked the door to be alone with my own thoughts and opening my writingdesk i spread before me four sovereigns and some silver barely my funeral expenses said i bitterly i leaned my head on my band and fell into a mood of sad thoughts i wasrt a bit of a poet i couldnt have made three lines of verse had you given me a million for it but somehow i bethought me of chatterton in his garret and said to myself  like him poor goswlett sunk famished in the midst of plentya man in all the vigour of youth able motive and energetic with a mind richly gifted and a heart tender as a womans i couldnt go on i blubbered out into a fit of crying that nearly choked me   please sir maid the maid tapping at the door  the gentleman in the next room begs you not to laugh so load   laugh burst i out  tell him woman to take care and be present at the inquest his evidence will be invaluable   i tried to take a retrospect of my life and see where and how i might have done better but all i could collect was that i had met nothing but ingratitude and ipjastce while other with but a tithe of my capacity had risen to wealth and honour i fated to evil from my birth fought my long fight with fortune and sank at last ex hausted i wonder will any one ever say poor gosslett i wonder will there beeven late though it beonne voice to dclare  that was no common man gosslett in any country but our own would have been distinguished and honoured to great powers of judgement he united a fancy rich varied and picturesque his tem perament was poetic but his reasoning faculties asserted the mastery over his imagination will they be acute enough to read me thus p will they knowin one wordwill they know the man they have suffered to perish in the midst of them  my one gleam of comfort was the unavailing regret i should leave to a world that had neglected me  yes said i bitterly  weep on and oease not  one more passage gosslett is dispatched on a mission to some brigands in italy while he was thus frothing and foaming i took my hat and passing quietly through the ranks of his household de d the stairs and proceeded into the street  i reached the vittoria  in no bland humour i must own thak i was flurried and irritated in no common degree i was too much excited to be able clearly to decide how far the insult i had received required explanation and apology or if it had prod the limita in which apology is still possible  perhaps thought i if i call him out hell hand me over to the police perhaps hell have me sent over the frontier who known what may be the limit to a minaisters power  while i wa thus speculating and canvassing with myself a card was preseted to me by the waiter mr sponnington attache hts legation nap and as suddenly the owner of it entered the room  he was a fairfaod blueeyed young man very shortsighted with a faint lisp and an effminate air he bowed slightly as he came forward and said  youre mr goewlett aint you  and not waiting for any reply be sat down and opened a roll of papers on the table  here are your instructions you are to follow them when you can you know and diverge from them whenever you must that is do whatever yon like and take the consequences sir james wns southeast you again he says you insulted him but he says that of almost every one the cook insults him when the soup is too salt and i insulted him last week by writing with pale ink that definition of diplomatic instructions do whatever you like and take the consequences is worthy as some reviewers would say to be written in letters of gold everywhere for it is a joke of universal applicationa perfect abridgment of what is known among mankind as 1 a friends advice here and there in these confessions the reader will recognise a hastilysketched likeness the interview with lord palmerston is evidently modelled upon one which actually took place and the glimpse you get of that minister in quite a new light really communicates something worth knowing there is much character in the sketch the reference to  beales on page 52 is surely an anachronism on page 116 we are told that doctors assure us that savages do not have dppepsi but is that so do doctors assure us of anything of the kind or is not the fact quite the other way p while we are finding fault we may just notice that the author falls occasionally into the errorperhaps nearly unavoidableof making gosslett who is a commonplace fellow talk like a man of ability and once more mr tupper is a much overdone topic and cleverer people could afford to leave him alone even if there were no such thing as the golden rule besides to say that traits in that mans writings vibrated in the closer chambers of the heart is to make a bad metaphor in conclusion we will only add that  paul tyossptomis sessions  contains some really good hints of taliy and occasional touches which prove that the autdw i t more than

the hero of a days  bide a lifes romance gives us shrewd suspicions about the authorship of these stories but if we are right mr lever is more sketchy than ever he has not taken the pains to make his

the adventures of harry richmond the adventures of harry richmond by george meredith in three volumes smith elder and co mr meredith writes cleverly but his cleverness has been turned to very bad account in this latest and apparently most ambitious of his novels it is in the form of an autobiography tracing the history of the hero from his birth till he is about thirty years old and it is doubtless intended to teach us many grand lessons about hereditary weaknesses in particular and all sorts of political and social matters in general towards this end mr meredith sets at defiance all ordinary rules of composition and indulges in the wildest vagaries of plotmaking  but the net result of his efforts is a work so enigmatical and with such constant affectation of wit that it is very irksome reading and so disappointing in the end that the reader who has plodded through the three volumes is likely to vow that he will never take up another of mr merediths novels in saying this we believe we are speaking heresy mr meredith is a prophet to a few and his habit of jerking out commonplaces as if they were wisdom is likely to be fascinating to some young ladies it is a poor habit however and it seems to have worn itself nearly threadbare in  the adventures of harry richmond  is it any waste of time to write of love   says harry richmond  the trials of life are in it but in a narrower ring and a fierier you may learn to know yourself through love as you do after years of life whether you are fit to lift them that are about you or whether you are but a cheat and a load upon the backs of your fellows the impure perishes the inefficient languishes the moderate comes to its autumn of decaythese are of the kinds which aim at satisfaction to die of it soon or late the love that survives has strangled craving it lives because it lives to nourish and succour like the heavens but to strangle craving is indeed to go through a death before you reach your immortality those sentences are a fair sample of the meaningless sententiousness with which mr meredith writes and they are put into the mouth of an utterly selfish man who after keeping at arms length during many years a young lady whom he is only disposed to marry in case another love affair in which he is engaged should prove hopeless at last comes back to her with a lying assurance that he has loved her all along and attempts to induce her then to take him instead of another man to whom after waiting many years for the other she has betrothed herself it may be a good thing to write down the sentimentalism that abounds in novels but it is certainly a bad thing to encourage the view in favour with many fashionable gentlemen that lovemaking is a lordly pastime for the superior sex only culpable when it leads to actual seduction or adultery and that womens hearts are only toys to play with or coin to profit by  and this is the gospel that mr meredith preaches harry richmonds history would have made the thread of a good novel had it been told simply and without praise he is the son of an unprincipled adventurer who is  the son of an actress and somebody and who accordingly spends everybodys money that he can get hold of in carrying on a lawsuit for recognition of his claims upon royalty and is meanwhile living as much like a prince as he can when he is not in a debtors prison harry richmond has in squire beltham a rich grandfather by his mothers side and the blunt honest squires character is not ill drawn though the drawing is a rough and exaggerated sketch not a finished portrait the squire wishes to make him his heir on condition of his renouncing his father and in the hope though this is wit an absolute condition that he will marry his cousin janet harrys father plays at higher game he maintains tn underhand connexion with his son squanders his monmr and schemes for his marriage with a german prhuazl thus after an account of harrys childish and schoolboy life which is perhaps the best portion of the book t2a complications of the story are brought about mr men dith has some power in constructing his puppets au the leading figures in the novel are sharply cut and many of the minor characters are fairly elaborated and individual ised  but they are only puppets they speak and act un naturally and if taken one by one some of them are tolerable their combined action is as preposterous as that of the puppets in a punchandjudy show mr meredith describes english life not as it is but as it pleases him to represent it and his description is alike unpleasant and unprofitable this is the more to be regretted because he throws out hints and collects rough material enough to stock two or three good novels with proper handling,englishfiction
  the one who looked on by f f montresor hutchin son miss montresor has a distinct quality among storywriters it is safe to predict a more conspicuous and lasting success for her than for many who have equal mental and imaginative gifts and even more interesting material to work on it is a spiritual rather than an intellectual distinction hers and it is the more powerful the stuff out of which her two books have been mainly woven is not of certain interest her characters if they presented themselves to us in life we might like to argue with orwe might disapprove of but introduced by her we accept them and judge them from their own standpoint she has the same effect on us as a sympathetic voice it is not easy more closely to define what made many readers to whom the religious novel is distasteful and others whose artistic fastidiousness was far from being satisfied read  into the highways and hedges  with unusual pleasure whatever it was it is present here again in this slighter book which is less directly religious in its subject and treatment gentleness or tolerance in her dealings with humanity might sum it up but perhaps quietism unattached to any particular doctrines most nearly describes its effect it would be unfair to compare the two books the first was elaborate ambitious varied the other is shorter slighter more limited in theme and incident but it is substantial enough to contain one real character perhaps twoonly sir charles was within the powers of a great many able writers to create and susie of very few the good people in novels who are as living as the wiselyfoolish goldenhearted susie are not numerous,englishfiction

i a w1him and its consequences in 3 vols london i   smitbelder and co one of the most brilliant fictions the season has pro duced but remarkable rather for coinposition than for the story the authors style is singularly vigorous and graphic he wastes no words condenses his thoughts and accomplishes by a single happy touch what writers of less genius employ a paragraph to elaborate it is evident that though as yet nameless an aspirant has stepped into the arena of literature who will ere long win for himself a conspicuous place lie has all the elements of success and only practice is wanted for their perfection his plot however is less entitled to praise its prominent features are borrowed from the stock incidents of the circulating library every one is familiar to the novelreaderthe gypsy warningsthe murder and the trial the whim that possesses a gentleman to assume the character of gardener that he may make acquaintance with the true character of a lower class of society these are hackneyed themes and would have consigned a whim and its consequences to speedy oblivion but for the original manner in which they are narrated character too is drawn with a few strokes of the pen so as to be distinctly comprehended and whether he attempts humour or pathos the author is equally happy in rousing the sympathies of his readers this sparkling style will be best exhibited by a few extracts and we are sure that all who read them will be desirous of perusing the work itself therefore the libraries may order it with assurance of a demand we last week presented a glowing appeal in behalf of the press from mr mitchell ilere is one no less i truthful the press in england the young gentlemans eye rested first upon one of those eloquent and masterly leading articles where all the powers of language and the acuteness of human reason sharpened by art and use are employed to give a peculiar view of some passing subject in what may well be called an essay which if mental labour and literary merit ever obtained reward in england would raise the writer far above the great body of those who are honoured by the crown and paid by the nation the vigour the subtlety the eloquence aye and the wisdom of many passages captivated the mind of chandos winslow but they brought a sad moral with them he had dreamed of employing his own talents in the world of letters of seeking fame and recompense by mental exertion but he now asked himself who is it wrote this splendid essay  what has been his reward in life  who will ever hear of him a what will be his future fate a man who can shake public opinion to its foundation who can rule and command the minds of millions by the sceptre of genius will live unhonoured but by a few unrewarded except by the comparatively small

tjie dove in the eagles nest new novels macmillan  co to combine moral teaching with interest is of all things the hardest for our part we regard the religious tag at the end of a novel with much the same respect as we do the crust at the lower side of an old bottle of choice port wine we would not disturb it for the world there are however persons who insist on your taking your dose of medicine well shaken together  but alas  in religious works the particles refuseto assimilate and at one time you have all the unctuousness of the oil at another all the sharpness of the vinegar and in no wise can the draught agree with your constitution the strange compound only nauseates your stomach the writer of  the dove in the eagles nest has managed to give us a clear pleasant tonic there are no lees and no muddy combination of perfect goodness and thorough wickedness we can confidently recommend the vintage the tale is in itself a beautiful moral and yet one does hot perceive that we are being lectured throughout where authors have a good purpose in view they should be doubly careful not to add to the stockintrade of the druggist who would not prefer a stroll through mr rimmels perfumery

henry viii  the scene is laid in germany under the emperors friedrich iii and maximilian we were much reminded of sir walter scotts novels ia perusing the book the same skilful use is made of real history how much have we all been indebted to novelwriters for our knowledge of history it would seem to us that shakespeares historical plays scotts novels and some others give a far greater insight into the past than the most careful collection of state documents there is as much difference as to the influence of such works on our memory and hearts as there is in attending a public meeting convened for taking some case into consideration and listening to ali which is said in a formal routine manner and being present at the occurrence itself where the touches of real life were so vividly apparent but to return to our dove who is in fact a rougher ina of the nbber castles possessed by a member of the free noblesso called because they made free with other peoples property faust recht or

  uncle ralph  a tale by the author of  doro thy parker  sonuncle ralphis a readable little story some of the characters are well drawn especially that of susan who commits cruel injustice by default the wrong that can be comprised in the mere abstinence from doing right is shown with some subtlety nevertheless the moral of the tory will hardly commend itself to soberminded elders two young creatures engaging themselves to be married without the least prospect of adequate ways and means would in real life meet with small countenance from prudent relatives miriam though justified perhaps in the eyes of the reader would certainly have a verdict against her in a family council held in any  cedar parlourinthe ltnited kingdom she was an  exceptional case but would make a dangerous precedent the one good point in the story is the tracing out of the poisonous influence of a wrong motive upon actions which in themselves are lawful and right uncle ralph himself is a very foolish elderly gentleman who believes everything he is told and who does everything he is bid by anybody which is the cause of all the woe ami confusion in the story,englishfiction

the finances of sir john kynnersley by a c fox davies john lane 6s mr foxdavies is a most ingenious man and it is to be hoped for the sake of the security of property that he will be content to confine his ingenuity to the manufacture of fiction and not himself practice the brilliant frauds and swindles which he ascribes to his hero for brilliant in conception as the various frauds are which help to consolidate the finances of sir john kynnersley the skill with which he covers his trail and renders detection impossible is even more brilliant ihe main idea of the book is revenge sir john has been let in to the extent of his whole fortune by an israelitish financiermoses ikestein  and he determines to get his own back with interest added this he succeeds in doing in various ways each more galling than the last and not only does he manage to hurt the jew in pocket but he also adds insult to the injury by making his victim supremely ridiculous in the end ikestein stung beyond all endurance is bold enough to prosecute sir john with fraud but the latter has been so careful of every detail that not a single one of the halfdozen charges can be brought home to him and his counsel secures him a triumphant acquittal altogether sir john collects about 6ooooo and retires into an honest private life with the girl of his choice whose story forms the last and most exciting chapter in the book the most noticeable point in the book is perhaps the skill with which mr foxdavies succeeds in keeping the readers sympathy for his disreputable hero it is not that sir john is especially fascinating  he is when all is said and done a very ordinary characterclever resourceful and determined but in spite of his scoundrelism and dishonesty he remains a  gentleman to use a banal word for want of a better and the reader forgives his dishonesty at times even is inclined to hold him justified if fur no other reason the book should win success for its sheer audacity it should also stamp mr foxdavies as a writer of clear imagination and no little skill both in devising a plot and in its execution,englishfiction
a princess of thule a princess of thule by william black third edition il three volumes macmillan whether ancient poets when they talk of  ultima thule mean iceland the mainland of the shetlands or another northern locality seems doubtful still more diffi cult it would be to define the realm of the lovesick king of thule in  faust with mr black the felicitous title of whose last novel has evidently been suggested by goethes ballad thule means a little islet in loch roag in the immediate vicinity of lewis the most northern of the hebrides sheila the heroine daughter to mr mekenzie familiarly called the king of borva is wooed and wedded by mr lavender a london artist and the greater part of the novel is taken up by her adventures in her new southern home the story of a child of nature being suddenly transferred into the blazing eentre of civilisation is nct unprecedented in truth or fiction the changes of aspect which a character deprived in this way of its proper foil offers to the eye of the world and particularly to that of an infatuated and often alas  too soon disappointed lover are indeed too striking not to attract the inquiring attenticn of the psychological observer readers of goethes autobiography cannot but remember with sympathetic pity for both parties the irrepressible feeling of incongruity with which the lively graces of the sebenbeim beauty struck the sensitive poet in a strasburg drawingroom of more modern treatments of a similar subject we may mention a novel by berthold auerbach the plot of which shows a faint similarity with mr blacks story and les amants a powerful though repulsive work by m hector malot in both these the result is tragic and ends in the more or less thorough destruction of the illmatched couples mir black has approached the problem from a different side ihe wants to show that a trulygreat nature will evince its intrinsic value even under the most un favourable circumstances and therefore he does not make the inevitable breach between the heroine and her husband irremediable it on the contrary turns out to have the most favourable consequences causing the katharsis of the worldlyminded mr lavender and resulting ultimately in the happy reunion of the lovers we fully admit the psychological truth and beauty of this solution but must regret at the same time the almost trivial manner in which the catastrophe is brought about the dleut of sheila in a london drawingroom is not as successful as her husband had expected it would be society is willing to acknowledige her claims to personal beauty but cannot see in her the sublime princess of the north as which she at first appeared to the romantic fancy of her enchanted lover in consequence he occasionally neglects her and i even begins a slight and as it afterwards turns out very innocent flirtation with a fascinating american widow sheila feels thoroughly discontented with her situation she is yearning for her beloved north and in a fit of nostalgy she contrives to adorn her husbands smokingroom with shells and bell heather in exactly the same manner as her i fathers parlour in borvabost so as to awaken old remniniscences and hint at the same time at a former promise to live part of the year in the western isles a cousin of hers half confidante half servant who has just arrived on a visit is also to act on the same occasion but unfortunately her husband has invited some grand friends for luncheon that day tile american beauty amongst them and when in consequence he refuses in rather a rough manner to let the scotch peasant girl partake of the feast the highminded princess of the north calmly walks into the kitchen orders luncheon for her husbands guests and after that takes the nearest fourwheel cab and drives with her country cousin to a queer old aunt of her husbands who quotes marcus aurelius and has her food weighed out to her for sanitary reasons here she lies hidden for some time i refusing steadfastly to return to her husband even passing him in the street without speaking the cause or at least the occasion of this crisis we think utterly inadequate and unwarrantable from a psychological point of view it may happen in the course of nature that young married people before their individualities are blended by mutual forbearance begin by quarrelling about trifles but then such qutvrlles vpaiour blow over as quickly as they arise but that a highminded and loving wife such as sheila is described should in this way desert her home and duty is utterly incredible the consequences of these rash steps ate however beneficial in more than one respect mr lavender who hitherto has considered his art more in the light of an amusement now makes an effort he leaves london for the wild scenery of jura and shows his repentance by means of honest and successful work another advantage of the catastrophe is the removal of the story from london the gloing de scriptions of northern nature in its wildness and beauty forui a striking contrast to the sketchy manner in which the heroines london life is delineated particularly the strange effects of arctic sunsets are rendered with a power and at the same time delicacy of tint only rarely met with in modern writing the following is the view of tile ocean in evening twilight seen from sheilas home jbcfore them ily

cometh np as a flower an autobiography  vols bentley  cometh up as a flower professes to be the autobiography of a charming young heroine but the reader will make much the same discovery as slender in the merry wives of windsor who says i came yonder at eton to marry mistress anne page and shes a great lubberly boy that the author is not a young woman but a man who in the present story shows himself destitute of refinement of thought or feeling and ignorant of all that women either are or ought to be is evideut on every page the style of the book is bad and full of slang the story itself is not one to be put into the hands of girls with a view to what some one calls their beneficial amusement there is an allpervading coarseness of thought and expression which is startling in its free and unrestrained utterance the descriptions which the young lady gives of her lovescenes would be coarse and flippant even as the confidential narrative of a fast young man of the order of jolly dogs to a kindred companion there is a mixture of slang and sensuality which setting aside all other considerations is in the worst possible taste of good feeling or ordinary good principle there is not a trace there is a sensual sentimentality selfindulgent emotion a morbid scepticism with dashes of equally morbid religious emotion of all true love or noble sentiment the story is destitute wo ate sorry to see a book of this kind making its appearance among our works of fiction it is a thoroughly bad style of book and it is not redeemed by talent there is no knowledge of life or character or human nature displayed the only two phases of existence which the author in his assumed feminine character seems to think women recognize are the delight of being kissed by a man they like and the misery of being kissed by one they dont like these two points seem to fill up his idea of the whole duty of women the heroine is a young lady of nineteen by hor own account the daughter of the rev sir adrian lestrange who is the sole representative of an ancient family now fallen into debt and decay at a dinnerparty she meets a handsome dragoon with yellow hair a stalwart figure blue eyes and  a

request from har yellowhaired lover she says  i made the required concession with less bashfulness than might have been expected of me and then took to my heels panting dishevelled crimson but in safety arrived in her own chamber there i sat by the open casementwindow with a box of mignonette under my nose with my candle fast flickering in its socket and departing this life with a grievous stink and with the summer dawn broadening across the pearlgrey sky i had fallen neck and crop into love speaking of another interview she says  good god how happy i felt lying in his arms and the top of my tall wreath scratching his handsome nose speaking of the surprise of a butcher on being paid his longoverdue bill she says he escaped apoplexy by a near shave that time so he thrust a hand as big as a fillet of veal into his pocket and counted out the change the course of the young ladys true love is interrupted by the designs of her elder sister who chooses she shall marry a middleaged baronet of 12000 a year he was a good man and deserved a better fate by the aid of treachery on the part of her sister and the pressure of debts and difficulties 01 her father nelly is induced to

it has found us perhaps not well disposed so soon to take up the theme of sea novels whether it is ia fault or we ave we will not undertake to say but foi one or the other reason this work certainly has appeared to us bess racy and amusing than wc had expected there is a very forced attempt to blazon a moral as the foundation of the tali which as usual docs not improve its construction the author sets out with a notion that thc discipline of a manofwar is  the sovoivigut thing on earth for rascality ingrain and acquired and in order to make out his effect lu begins by painting his hero so detestable a charaetr so full of baseness meanness and ingratitude that the reader only hopes thal he will bc duly hanged in though third volume considered morely as a story  the arethusa ia too much coiisiructed of events rendered notorious by thc gazettes and by naval histories so that we aro reminded at every turn of our most familiar reading the reappeaancoofuh stories in a parody the names

  i the botor chaperon by c n and a m williamson methuen  co the authors have had a remarkable success in stories concerning motors and their latest which records the adventures of two girls in a motorboat throughout holland is likely to be popular their writing though it does not pretend to literary quality has both gaiety and naturalness so that their glorified tours duly spiced with a love interest are agreeable reading here we have photo graphs of dutch places and people to aid verisimilitude we hope that the abbre viated word of the title will not become current,englishfiction
the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby os max goschen an unmistakable originality is evident in every one of the fourteen stories and sketches which comprise the adventuress the author seems to have studied maupassant but followed him at a safe distance for if the method is similar the manner is his own mr willoughby loves his london and places in it the familiar types generally with a suggestion of the bizarre but without straining for effect and always with delicacy he has the true dramatic instinct even the longest speeches of his characters have a cumulatively stimulating effect  the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby goschen 2s net of these fourteen  stories three are distinctly striking by reason of a certain passionate crudity a realism that gives actual discomfort when we think that it may mean reality these three are  lily may  life wins and  a sea captain  quick cruel sensational sketches that evolve thoughts of pastel work  dark clouded backgrounds now lit up by the lurid gleams of the lowest life now suffused with a changing glow of luxury we would add the  watch night service did it not recall overforcibly mr wellss  love and mr lewisham  a london dawn  and the  psychology of fires  are more in the nature of tours de force  vivid in their way but unreal showing too much composition in the pastel this defect is still more marked in the descriptions of the isle of dogs and rosherville and it reaches a climax in the 4 correspondence mr willoughby are we right in the sex  delights in his technique which is nearly if not always equalled by his observation  but it is our impression that both will run to seed if devoted overmuch to sketches of this nature  in a larger theme these qualities would be kept within bounds and so be more effective he might try a wider and more complex field  the adventuress for example though its abrupt ending evidently so designed is not devoid of cleverness might be developed into a good novel,englishfiction
the spanish match or charles stuart at madrid  nn ittail rw  t ll by william harrison ainsworth chapman and hall the  house of seven chimneys has for some months been exciting the lovers of romanoe in bentleys miscellany and the story being concluded reappears with the above title mr ainsworth has long held undisputed sway as grand master of historical narrative and this his latest work is a valuable addition to the series which he has provided for that class of readers who delight in the romance of history and of these there is even now we are happy to observe no want it might be regretted that the tide has ceased to set in favour of this style of literature were it not that the author of these three exciting and pleasant volumes has a monopoly in it and is unapproachable in his treatment of incidents well known but which in hie hands obtain a fresh and delightful novelty mr ainsworths historical novels have always the great merit of being the work of a man whose interest in details of the past is strong and whose points of local and historical colouring are accurate as any antiquary could desire while he remains true in spirit to the stir and bustle and the very phrasing of the school of romance in which he graduated long ago with firstclass honours the freshness of his treatment of old themes is very noticeable few readers for instance are ignorant of the sentimental journey of charles in search of a wife yet the way in which mr ainsworth takes advantage of a readymade tale is so skilful that it is impossible not to read it with an interest ever springing and entirely new this is a remarkable faculty possessed by the author who has led many youthful students entranced by his manner of relating facts to seek in authentic records a confirmation of the narrative which has so enthralled their imagination this is no small merit and one which since the great sir walter few can claim we welcome therefore this royal romance of real life and follow the adventures of the chivalrous prince and his companions with infinite amusement and pleasure and are convinced that the book will be one of the author8 most popular productions in these days of dramatic adaptation we feel convinced that any enterprising manager would find in mr ainsworths picturesque volumes ample material of bullfights processions and tournaments for a gorgeous spectacle combined with a very interesting lovestory the story opens with king jamess perplexity as to the chances of the spanish match succeeding and by the daring and promptitude of buckingham whose character is admirably kept up throughout the important decision is arrived at that the heir apparent shall have his desire and cross the seas in quest of his lady love the adventurers meet with their first peril directly they reach the french shore jack and tom are the names chosen by the prince and buckingham just at the hour of two in the afternoon they entered the harbour of boulogne and after some little delay were permitted by the officers of the port to disembark and charles for the first time set foot in france cottington having concluded all arrangements with captain pynchen before landing jack and tom underwent no detention on that score but followed by a couple of sailors carrying their baggage proceeded to the ecu dor in the grande rue where they were welcomed by a very civil landlord who told them they were too late for the table dhdte but considerately added that he could speedily set an excellent dinner before them this was agreed to but the dinner was not served so promptly as promised and being copious took some time to discuss consequently it was hard upon four oclock before the travellers were in the saddle attended by two gailydressed postilions wearing enormous jackboots and who made the quay eoho with the claogour of their horns they rode out of boulogne and crossing a wooden bridge over the liane took the road to montreuil where they proposed to pass the night and where they arrived without accident or interruption about seven oclock and took up their quarters at the tele de bceuf renowned for its pates de becassines rising betimes next morning they were all on horseback soon after seven and on the way to amiens which they determined to make the limit of that days journey all the party were in high spirits to charles the novelty of travelling in a foreign land was exciting and though the country through which he rode was uninteresting in a picturesque point of view in his present frame of mind it became invested with charms such as many a really beautiful landscape had not revealed to him fortunately the weather was fine and the state of the roads good so that the travellers got on without annoyance a joyous company they wereas joyous and lighthearted aa any that bad preceded them on the aame route whether it was change of clime and scene or the excitement they had previously undergone that occasioned this gaiety none cared to inquire being perfectly satisfied with the result even sir francis cottington who had been so strongly averse to the expedition yielded to the enlivening influences and began to view the project with a hopeful eye though maintaining hia habitual gravity of look charles at heart was as gleeful as his companions never had be been more entirely free from the melancholy which usually oershadowed himnever was the present more void of gloom iever did the future look brighter sometimes in order to indulge in fit of pleasant musingto dwell upon the charms of his mistressto conjure up the idea ot their first interview and his transports on beholding herhe would ride apart from the othersbut he soon returned to join in their lively chat in this manner they advanced on their journey scarcely aware how much they had accomplished after skirting the forest of crecy close to which the famous hattie was won by edward iii the thought of which roused the warlike spirit of charles and made him burn for the military renown of the black prince they descended into the vale of the 8oue and traversed it till they reached abbeville har they alighted at tba htteld la fast litislil  ta

bava recently been in england and during our stay visited your famous raoeoouree at newmarket while there we hsd tite singular satisfaction of beholding bia hiahneas the prince of wales and tba lord

monsieur when we declare that in two of your party who have just gone in arith the landlord we conoeive that wa recognise prinoe charles and the lord marquis i take what you say as a great compliment to my friends messieurs returned graham without the slightest embejttasmeot but you are mistaken the gentlemen to whom you refer are very humble individualstwo brothers the mesaieur smith they certainly bear some resemblance to the illustrious personages you have mentionedenough perhaps to deceive a stranger  the resemblance ia too striking in both instances to admit of doubt upon the point observed m de nouvion  of course it is not for us to make a remark if the prinoe of walea and the lord marquis choose to travel incognito  i will speedily convince you of your error messieurs interrupted graham and stepping within the doorway he shouted u hola jack and tom come hither for a moment i pray of you at this summons jack and tom immediately came out of the salle a manger into which they had been ushered by the host and jsck eaid as if addressing an equal  what do you want with us dick   these gentlemen will have it that you are the prinoe of wales and my lord of buckingham replied graham  pray undeceive them for they will not credit my denial you do us too much honour messieursfsr too much observed jack  it is not however the first time that my brother tom and myself have been taken for the important personages in question  i should think not said m marcellin  the resemblance is rather unlucky for us remarked tom  it has more than once got us into difficulties  i can easily imagine it rejoined de noovion sceptically  it must be unpleasant also for the prince and the lord marquis to be mistaken a they might be accidentally for you and your brother m jack smith of course you have seen my lord of buckingham monsieur he added  oh yes i have seen him returned tom  we have seen both him and the prince eb jack   frequently returned jack  then you may possibly bave remarked as i did returned m de nouvion  that the marquis wears a ring on the first finger of the right handprecisely such a ring as yours m tom 8tnith while the prince has a brooch the counterpart of which fastens the cloak of your brother jack   a 8 fast as the lively party ride onwards adventures pour in upon them and there is no lack of peril and danger to surmount by their ready wit and fearless courage mr ainsworth must have visited the land he describes so well and we predict that his work will be admitted as one of the best guides for travellers to madrid in future just as sir walters romance of the loire was accepted in that locality we are not sure that archie armstrong was really tossed by a bull in the presence of the infanta but as every character introduced is known to history and most of the incidents did really happen we are content to take that episode for granted and laugh in good faith the pretty appearance of the dove is not imaginary and although it misled the sentimental prince into false hope seemed made expressly to heighten the effect of a love scene and is duly seized upon by the acute romancer charles arrived at madrid after escaping brigands and inconvenient recognitions at length sees the object of his wishes of the meeting between chaelbs and thb xneaeta mabia the old palacio beal of madrid to which our story refers must not be confounded with the existing palace which comparatively speaking is a modern building being only completed about a hundred yean ago the ancient structure was in fact the moorish alcarar and bad been the abode of the caliphs till they were driven from new castille to granada it waa first occupied as a palace by enrique iv towards the close of the fifteenth oentury but few changes were made in it till the time of charles v when the pile was partially rebuilt and enlarged and its original character materially destroyed philip ii may be said to be the first christian monarch who dwelled within the alcazar of madrid for until the completion of the eeoorial in 1584 he made it his chief residence not till the reign of thia gloomy monarch did madrid itself become the capital of spain and from the same epoch must be dated the importance of the city few changes were made in the alcazar by philip iii who was perfectly content with thepalaee bequeathed to bim by bit illustrious sire and philip iv had as yet been too short a time on tba throne to attempt any improvements though heterogeneous in its architecture and certainly not so beautiful as it bad been in the days of its moslem rulers the roysl palace of madrid was a vast and magnificent pile occupying a most commanding position on the heights overlooking the valley of the manzanares immediately beneath the royal edifice extending from the foot of the eminence on which it stood to the banks of the river was the campo del moro part of which was laid out as gardens viewed cither from the grand plaza from the valley or from afar the palsce presented a moat striking and picturesque appearance it was entered by two moorish gates the beautiful architecture of which was happily undisfigured and the buildings surrounding the spacious court were studded with cupolas and minarets above these towered the ancient keep with its zigzag battlements and turret at each angle besides a number of small courts th palace comprehended a superb patio surrounded by apartments laid out in the arabian style charles disguised as a page is conducted by gondomar from tba corridor the count and the newlymade page proceeded through a variety of paseages up and down staircases until they tame to a superb suite of rooms the windows of which gondomar informed bis companion overlooked the valley of the manzanares all these were

vzctzon i castles in the air a novel by mrs gore in 3 vols london 1847 the defect of this novel is its entire want of originality mrs gore has failed to produce a new feature in her plot or a new character for her actors the theme is the stale one of a narrowminded illbred fool suddenly made rich and a representation of the follies and meannesses and wickedness which such a personage will commit when a power is placed in his hands which he has not the virtue or the discretion to wield then has mrs gore chosen the form of autobiography and made this wretch henry wrottesley tell his own tale but the mask is so ill worn that in every page we are reminded that it cannot be the writing of the illbred man whose tale it professes to tell but that it is mrs gore speaking in his name and this conviction mars much of the pleasure of the tale we are obliged to recognise it as afiction whether we desire it or not how mrs gore has contrived so to familiarise herself with the sayings and doings of such a set as are here depicted blackguards and blacklegs and the scum of society is really astonishing and this she does well and truthfully but as a whole this novel although better and more readable than many that the season has produced is not worthy of mrs gores reputation we fear she is writing herself out,englishfiction
the legends of smokeover principal jacks is better known to most of us as editor of the hibbert journal than as presiding over manchester college oxford or again as the author of a volume called  the alchemy of thought  than as the biographer of stopford brooke he has written stories beforewitness  philosophers in trouble and in and out of them has given specimens of ability as a man of wit and satire in his quarterly review we meet with him more especially as one who is versed deeply in the deeper thought of the day the present volume is at once characteristic and unexpectedcharacteristic because it has something of all the qualities just intimated and is original in its own way as he is always but unexpected also because it is like nothing that he has done previously it is in any case a book which will set its readers thinking in several vital directions if they are capable of anything that it is worth while calling thought it is not what ordinarily people would call religious and yet it makes for righteousness for one grows better in the reading as if the value of things that matter had risen suddenly in our esteem and the false values had come down to their proper level of nil smokeover is  a city much like london as shelley said once of another place which it would be invidious to mention in the present connection in a sense its legends belong to a world philosophised its economics to faerie its dramatis personae to a realm not realised where daily life is exercised normally in heroics but in a second sense which is perhaps truer the place is just like this one the people are just like some of us but a little lifted up in a motive light of otherwhere it should be said that smokeover is a state a presiding spirit rather than a place and it happens that its legends are those of rebels who are on strike for a kingdom  not founded on smoke it comes about therefore that all its personalities are types written over with eloquent meanings from head to foot and all its events are omens yet it is in the sense that we also are types full of messages for those who can read and our every event is a portent the fact that the book claims to be one of legends the divisions of which are marked plainly by italicised paragraphs after the manner of interludes does not prevent it from being an ordered story in continuity from beginning to end and the fact that it is a parable  with child of great intent does not prevent it from being as much like a novel as such a thing can well be very living too in the telling it begins in smokeover and ends on the verge of utopia amidst largess of poetical justice for those who concern the reader it is arabian nights if you like or a scheme of universal reconstruction of a very practical kind which is perhaps the same thing if it is not a guide to the perplexed like that of maimonides principal jacks is to be congratulated on a brilliant book which can be approached and appreciated from several angles including paradoxical philosophy a e w   the legends of smokeover by l p jacks us 6i hodder  stoughton,englishfiction

a county family a novel by the author of  lost 51 va1 tinalev brothers sir massingberd 3 vols tinsley brothers this is one of a large class of novels which it is very difficult to describe yet there are few more interesting studies in literature than the attempt to discover the peculiar difference that exists between the true and genuine novel which contains actual portraits of living and veritable people and the counterfeit novel which has only the raw materials of fictionthe simulacra of life these latter novels seem to us but a heap of dry bones over which the author has breathed in vain they will not stir in spite of his best endeavours the characters are mere puppets which imitate the movements of men and women and yet show clearly to the spectator the strings by which they are moved nevertheless it is possible to take some interest in watching the different combinations which the master of the puppets produces there is often in these novels the outline of a stirring and dramatic story which the inexperienced novelreader will regard with interest the experienced novelreader on the other hand is content to watch the evolutions of the story with curiosity he says to himself  what is to be the next combination of these puppets  surely it is time for the villain to make his appearance a murder at least is due in the next chapter will the hardhearted father be made to relent or will he be killed off   we repeat the story of some of these novels is frequently highly ingenious the kaleidoscopic changes of position are marvellous considering the monotonous sameness of the materials used and as we wish to say as much as possible in favour of the industrious and painstaking author of  a county family we will preface some brief account of the novel by remarking that the story is likely to be very interesting to those whose individual power of imagination may lead them to fancy that they are regarding real men and women in  a county family we find a good many old friends there is the obdurate father the lover who is forbidden the house the faithful heroine the mercenary suitor the villain who has murdered his wife and who torments everybody until the bursting of a reservoir swallows him up tet before the author settles down to the level jogtrot of storytelling we catch a glimpse of one figure which promises much anthony blackburn when we are first introduced to him looma large and distinct out of the mist of vague and commonplace detail which smothers the story we cannot help suspecting that the author of  a county family had some definite original in his mind when he sketched this character so true and lifelike is the old man until he gets enveloped in the conventional meshes of the tale and disappears from sight this anthony blackburn is an old man who in his youth married a country wench and was thereupon disinherited by his father and sent forth into the world to earn his own living when we meet him he ia a quarryman earning his daily bread on the side of one of the welsh mountains he is possessed by the one idea that he will yet become the owner of the family estates hia younger brothers who have according to the fathers will successively taken possession of the property have one by one been removed by death they and their offspring until there stands between him and the estates only one young man at the opening of the story old anthony blackburn haa just had his dinner brought bim by his granddaughter ellen in presence of a visitor assasd stsahope family anthony blaekbura waa iadssssdhwlry of sis wtiss

silver bottom of hit pocketflask in place of the broken tumbler  if you will permit me to fill it with sherry instead of water said he politely41 have more here than i require u nay sir i do not drink

he with sudden interest yes and my addressherbert stanhope of curlew hall at your service oh indeed returned the old man with an affectation of unconcern while his face bronzed with sun and wind turned suddenly quite pale good morning sir and thank you it it time for me to begin work again with that he took up hit accustomed weapon but the visitor who at this hint had retired to tome distancenoticed that he did not make a stroke with it for several minutes but stood leaning on the long handle at if in thought stanhope looked round for the girl but she had disappeared and then for the overlooker but he had also slipped away so shrugging his shoulders he lighted a cigar and betook himself down the unprotected incline notwithstanding that a bugle had just blown to give warning to all to seek shelter the granddaughter ellen whose father is dead is betrothed to a young engineer named john denton who ia a sort of overseer at the quarry in which anthony blackburn works she has an uncle the eldest son of old anthony who is the family bugbear this william blackburn is quite a typical villain he has just completed a term of imprisonment when we find him idling in one of the channel islands he has married a poor girl whom he brutally illuses in fact his conduct towards women throughout the whole book is peculiar it must have cost him an uncommon deal of trouble to be so officiously and pertinaciously offensive we are led to believe that villainy is very hard work and that if it waa william blackburns business to furnish forth the  dreadful example  to everybody around him there was never poor mortal so dreadfully overwrought the author gives him neither sleep nor rest he must be continually sulking at some one or cursing at some other or threatening a third indeed the author of  a county family  has on previous occasions shown an amount of cruelty towards his villains which is much to be regretted there never was such a slavedriver if the characters in a novel had any will of their own we feel assured that this writers villains would  strike and refuse to have all the business of the story thrown upon their shoulders mr tates is another writer who used to overwork bis villains but of late he has become tenderhearted and much lem of a taskmaster before however saying anything of what mr william blackburn is made to do in  a county family let us take a last look at his father before he becomes nebulous old anthony blackburn does inherit his own estates and returns thither aa he drives up to the door of the house with his wife and granddaughter beside him a number of the tenantry and neighbours are collected he stops the carriage and addresses them and there is something very fine and natural about these unpremeditated and earnest words neighbours and friends said he in a hoarse voice  i thank you for your welcome tonne ought to know me well though you do not but that it not my fault nor yours i thought to stand here

japhet in search of a father by the author of  peter sim pie sec we do not mention this work for the sake of uttering one syllable in its praise we feel certain that all other critics will most completely take that trouble off our hands we merely announce its appearance in three orthodox volumes and feel that we shall very shortly have to announce its dispersion all over the reading world not to do thus much would be putting a sort of slight upon our readersto do more we are much more capable than inclined  japhet in search of his father by the author of jacob faithful 3 vols we are acquainted with few novels in our language that has been received with more general approbation than the jacob faithful  of captain marryat the humour the drollery the truth and fidelity of the descriptions the force of outline with which the characters were drawnall pleased in spite of many defects in the formnaof the story the beauties and faults of the present novel however inferior it may be to its predecessor are the same it abounds in spirit liveliness variety of character drollery of adventure and vis cornica throughout to be sure its comedy is always on the borders of farce and as long as effect is produced no matter what it costs the whole is a wondrous web of incongruities and impossibilities such as no picture of human life ever presented scarcely one event is even probable scarcely one character consistent but if the taste of the author is to be called in question in collecting such materials for his edifice his skill and genius must the more be praised for that he has been able to give it if not the proportions of classical design at least sufficient attractions to detain the attention and delight the fancy few of the characters are well drawn on the whole all of them clever and vigorous and characteristic in parts we do not think there is much continued interest in the fate or fortunes of any of the dramatis personae and it matters very little how the whole narrative endt but the separate incidents are very agreable and very absurd the portraits are certainly not by lawrence but rather in the free style of h b and the whole is an assembly of the most extraordinary people and in the most extraordinary circumstances that ever took place whether we speak of mr phineas cophagus the apothecary at smithfield who was gored by a mad bullturned quaker and so onreturned churchman and so onand then was gored again at the distance of a quarter of a century whether by the same bull or not we cannot savor miss aramathea judd whose character we take to be the most inventive that our author ever imposed on the credulity of his readers that young ladies wearfalse faces we potently believe but seldom with miss judds design of passing for their grandmothers the other is an irish baronet sir h de clare who and his lady turn gipsies and mountebanks and what not as for the hero of the tale himself who mistakes every man with a long nose for his father and seeing the bishop o exeter the then bishop enjoying an unusual longitude of proboscis fixes on him as his parent to the no small astonishment of the virtuous prelate who cures lady maelstrom of hysterics by pouring a bottle of marking ink into her mouth instead of eaudecologne and then to correct his mistake bv following it up with a quart of stinking green water where flowers had been placed who passes himself off to lord windermere as his son who is taken up and condemned for highway robbery who is confined in the cellar of an irish castle and all but murdered who gives himself out in london as a young man of ten thousand a year who sets up druggist at reading who turns quaker for love of a young quakeress who finds at last his father looking like a large bengal

elster9s folly elsters folly by mrs henry wood 3 vols cr svo pp 945 sis gd tinsleybrothers through history of a vacillating man without any great faults but allowing himself to be drawn into many scrapes and even serious dangers from want of moral courage to resist temptation the principal character is well conceived and drawn out with much spirit the plot is well woven and the interest of the tale preserved by a clever illusion put upon the reader which is not cleared up till at the dose of the novel but we do not consider that the writer has been so successful with another of her dramatis personce the dowager countess of kirton this lady may be a photograph of some living person but is far too gross a caricature to be a representative of good society the most remarkable quality observable in the countess dowager apart from her great breadth was her restlessness she seemed never still her legs had a fidgetty nervous movement in them  and in moments of excitement which were not unfreqnent she was given to excecute a sort of wardance old she was not but her peculiar graces of person her rotund form her badlymade front of flat flaxen curls which was rarely in its place made her appear so a bold scheming unscrupulous vulgarminded woman who had never been considerate of other peoples feelings in her life whether they might be her equals or her inferiors we cannot help feeling that this sketch must be introduced for the purpose of gibbeting some enemy  although perchance it may be only for the sake of producing a contrast with the delineation of the handsome elegant elster who becomes her victim the dowager countesss language moreover is more suitable for the mouth of a ladysmaid or a housekeeper than for that of a lady if ever i saw such behaviour in all my existence with many like expressions which seem to us not in keeping with the rank of the person who utters them elster is the younger brother of lord hartledon and is much snubbed by lady kirton who is a cousin but pretends to be an aunt in order to fix herself at hartledon house percival elster is much in debt and much in love with miss ashton daughter of the rector of caine near the family seat of the elsters lady kirton has brought her daughter lady maude to stay with lord hartledon in the hope of catching him a quarrel arises between val elster and his brother the earl owing to a mistake made by a bailiff in arresting the latter as mr elster lord hartledon goes to the rectory that he may prove himself not to be his brother and there lets out the state of his brothers affairs by which unlucky incident val is forbidden to visit miss ashton any longer elster is very indignant with his brother and they have a quarrel in consequence a boatrace takes place some time afterwards and lord hartledon is missing having injured himself and rendered himself helpless he is found at last drowned at the inquest there is amystery about the accident and a man named pike who has been a squatter on the estate evidently suspects mr elster of having somehow a share in his brothers death lady kirton without the smallest scruple sets herself to separate elster and miss ashton and marry the new earl to her own daughter this she effects by means of underhand letters to the ashton family and by bullying elster in another of his follies the crowning one of being engaged to two women at the same time and being persuaded into marrying the one he does not really love after the marriage a secret trouble falls on the new earl of hartledon he has evidently committed some great crime which renders him a slave to a man who visits him and holds long interviews with him a mr carr a barrister is his friend and stands by him in every way lady hartledon learns the secret at last and being subject to heart complaint at the shock of an accident to her son dies and after a while lord hartledon marries ann ashton and pensions off dowager lady kirton we are then permitted to discover that the secret is that val elster had suffered himself to be entrapped into a scotch marriage before he married lady maude kirton  consequently her children are illegitimate the skill of the novelist is displayed most in keeping up the suspicion of the reader that  elaters folly  is murder and not bigamy this is managed with very considerable power the authoress appears more at home in drawing the characters of boys and young men than of ladies we do not think miss ashton herself with her brusque manner is very loveable some characters from low life are much more true to nature the sketch of mrs green a timid woman given to fits apparently but really having to conceal the secret return of a son who lives near her disguised as the min pike is well worked out the story although conveying the feeling of a tragedy turns out at last to be but a serious comedy elster is in spite of his folly a kindhearted wellmeaning man and thoroughly enlists our sympathies although he angers us by his weakness there is so much ability in this ladys novels that we have ventured to be more critical of the defects than we should otherwise have been there is the means of exciting interest in her hands without overstepping the limit of probability the character of elster improves under his trials and we cannot but admire the moral tone which is given to the work by his selfinflicted sufferings while at the same time we cannot but do justice to the liberal spirit in which the faults of mankind are treated the style is easy and readable  an acquaintance with the different classes of society is manifested the description of the young scamp the boy kipper is particularly lifelike the authoress has a special talent for depicting boysa race generally not much in favour with ladies she enters into their ways and feelings and hits off their characteristic heedlessness and generosity with a hearty sympathy which speaks well for her powers of appreciation it is something nowadays to meet with a writer who can draw lifelike characters and yet elicit from her story a good moral teaching such as we have set before us in  sisters folly,englishfiction
old sir dowjla xkw xovlilft by the hon mrs norton  vols hurst cc blackett j hoxouiauiy distinguished by though fewness  and excellence of her works from many writers  of her own sex who whilst catching something of her manner and attempting to reproduce her  mode of dealing with certain social questions  neither imitate her patient thoughtfulness nor  emulate her thoroughness of endeavour mrs  norton throughout her long literary career  has allowed herself intervals for repose j and study between the appearances of her i publications she has been no prolific author j i embarrassing the libraries with volumes written  for what sportsmen and painters term  the i pot rather than for those nobler ends the  achievement of which is the artists chosen and peculiar sport but whatever has come from j her pen possesses a measure of those higher j qualities without which the labour of the scribe j is but the labour of him who writes his name in water  old sir douglas is not without defects but it is a book that will satisfy the expectations of mrs nortons many admirers and is worthy of a writer who having been a personal witness of much that is most brilliant in human society and a sufferer of much that is most sad in human life describes with equal candour and vividness though things that she has seen and the sorrows that she has felt its pages are alive with the old sympathy for good women writhing under slander though old abhorrence of certain kinds of masculine selfishness and brutality the old fierce contempt for the malignity and harshness of selfrighteous women  who havo a larger measure of charity for i triumphant sin than downtrodden virtue in i these respects the novel resembles tales that  preceded it but in some particulars the story  contrasts favourably with most works of fiction j which aim at enlisting sympathy in behalf  of women on whom social opinion has put the brand of shame its judgments and indignation are less onesided and defiant than they would have been had the book been written in times less remote from incidents which first inspired the author to exclaim against mnns  violence and womans spite another indica tion of the change which soothing influences i have wrought in a mind that notwithstanding i its championship of injured innocence was  formerly more alert to fight the strong than to i respect the feeble is the tenderness exhibited  towards weak things simply because they aro  weak for instance in all that concerns the l ludicrous repellent imbecility of lady chari lotte skifton mrs norton shows a fine com passion for failings that rouse in ordinary j spectators no kindlier sentiment than derision  but the feature of the book for which the  author will be most commended by moralists is through the goodness of gertrude skifton whose i tribulations are the chief source of the readers entertainment usually in novels written with the special purpose of  old sir douglas the wretched heroine is guilty of indiscretions that give countenance to the assertions of her calumniators but from her girlhoodbefore  she encounters her future husband until ho is i induced to impute to her extreme wickedness and further on through her career until her long endurance of cruel misconstruction terj initiates in the vindication of her honour and  the recovery of his affectionate confidence 1 gertrude hokb the readers unqualified respect j as well as his sympathy guileless stainless i faultless in her nature and life even as she i3 i lovely in person she commits no single act j that she should have left undone and great praise is due to the art which shows how such a perfect woman may by a combination of j untoward conditions and malignant influences j be covered with the obloquy that is the sharpi est part of the punishment which social opinion i  assigns to certain sorts of conjugal infidelity   the woman thus cruelly sinned against though   never sinning is brought upon the scene at   naples whither the old sir douglas ofthe  i titlepage has hastened from his home in scoti land to rescue his nephew and heirprcsump  tive from the hands of profligate associates r and in that brightest of pleasureloving cities  i gertrude skifton who has unconsciously won r such love ns the dissipated kenneth ross  j can offer a simple maiden gives her hand and 1  heart to kenneths uncle for though the  i epithet old  has been attached to sir douglas 3  by his abandoned nephew he is but a i middleaged man at the opening of the i j neapolitan scenes and that readers may r j not suppose him disqualified by years to j j win the love of a young girl mrs norton is careful to endow him with personal attrac j tiveness as well as a sublimely chivalric dis a position there is no example of human t beauty more perfectly picturesque than a very f handsome man of middle age is the bold a statement with which the story commences t and in sir douglass case this grand pictur   esqueness is united with moral graces that j t justify the authors flattering commendations t of middle age as the period of life in which i men of true heroic stuff and mould are seen  to best advantage at the age of which i 1 am speaking says the novelist  small annoy 1 ances have ceased to afflict great hopes and  i fears are subject to a more noble reserve the  passionate selfishness of inexperience has van   ished the restlessness of learning how much or how little life can achieve is calmed down the smile of welcome in such a mans countenance is worth all the beauty of his adolescent years this is both true and happily expressed with respect to those exceptional natures that like fullbodied wines ripen and mellow under the silent action of time and it is none the less true because it may render  old sir doughs popular with certain habitual occupants of seats at clubwindows to whom the praise is by no means applicable every fact of sir douglass career is consistent with the compliments thus lavished upon him by his creator at the outset of the story no taint of selfishness or vanity or hardness alloys though excellence of this perfect model of gentle manliness of whom no less than of the knight in the canterbury tales it may be said thoujh that he was worthy he was wise and of his port ns nieke as is a mayde he never yet no villanie northeast sayde in all his life unto no manner wight he was a veray parflt gentil knight in strong contrast against the gentleness and fine courtesy of sir douglas ross stand  though licentiousness and ruffianism of his hand some nephew kenneth whose riotous debaucheries aro strongly and daringly set forth by j a writer whose delineations of masculine vice i have never failed through want of that courage  and love of plain language which incline moral teachers to call a spade a spade and the ditterj ences of the uncle and nephew are made all the  more apparent by the manner in which the j story brings them into collision unaware of  his nephews tenderness for gertrude and j naturally inferring from his profligate life that j her simple goodness would of itself inspire him j with a distaste for her charms sir douglas surrenders himself to the girls artless fascina j tions and becomes her accepted suitor the discovery of his uncles success with gertrude  fills kenneths soul with rage and having in past times repaid sir douglass generous love and excessive consideration with insolent words j and undutiful acts  full of that blind and boundless ingratitude which belongs to early youth he now commits a murderous assault on the man who has loaded him with favours and cherished him with more than parental tenderness for a time the uncle and nephew are divided but events bring about their reconciliation so that after kenneths marriage with a spanish beauty they live together in scotland with the outward appearances of mutual amit until sir douglas believes himself to have received conclusive testimony of gertrudes reprehensible intercourse with his lawless nephew in the devices that having first filled sir douglass heart with an abominable suspicion make him at last so certain of his wifes guilt that he condemns her unheard and hastens to though crimea in search of a soldiers grave mrs norton exposes herself to a charge of defective originality but though some of her incidents and one or two of the principal actors in her second and third volumes are conventional and falsethe management of the story not only sustains the readers anxiety for the heroine but also compels him to feel a strong interest in the subordinate actors of the complicated and exciting drama how gertrudes vindication is brought about devourers of novels will like to ascertain for themselves on that point we will be as silent as we have been with respect to all the details of the writers artistic contrivances enough has been said to show that  old sir douglas is a thoroughly

reviews of books the ring of ama sis  min lrror is the most perverse of authors he has talents of no mean order and if he would bhat do justice to himself he could lot fait at the same time to give pleautre to his readers but he uttorlv refuses to allow any weihlit to such trivial considerations and deliberately injures his own reputation while he insults the audience to which he addresses himself in the present book he has chosen a different means of arriving at this end from that which he has employed before hitherto he has published as his own corlpositions what were little more than renderings of works by other authors he now introduces what appear to be his gtenuine lucubrations as the offspring of anothers brain it is true that the story is not entirely original nor are the philosophical reflections for whose display it forms a convenient vehicle remarkable for novelty but the physician on whom they are fathered is utterly destitute of vitality and his existence is even more improbable than that of the hero of the work we should be glad to think that the dreariness of the tale was due to its teutonic origin but we fear that we must set it down to mr lyttons account as an adapter he may have been somewhat unprincipled but at least lhe was not dull  as a creator he may be honest but he is tedious we prefer him infinitely in the former capacity the  ring of aniiasis in mnany respects resembles sir edward lyttons  strange story each romance outrages probability and sets the laws of nature at defiance without comipunction ini each the narrator is a medical nan deeply versed in the mysteries of science and capable of the most unintelligible language spirits haunt the one as much as the other and both are replete with moral sentiments sufficient in number to stock a writingmrasters copybook but deficient in the force requisite to extricate themselves from the machinery under which they are crushed mr lyttons story is as incomprehensible as sir edwards but the skill which enables the father to keep alive his readers interest is but partially shared by the son the physician to whomn we are supposed to be indebted for the story met its hero on board a rhine steamer and was at once fascinated with his appearance nor is it wonderful that count edniond r produced so instantaneous an effect for so refined was he that  he was almost invisible this description appears a little vague but all haziness of outline is cleared up at once when we learn that he was the iiiip of plastic repose the image did not associate with the other passengers for it enjoyed the habitual consciousness of an unapproachablc high social position which enables the few who possess it to pass through the crowd without ever coming in contact with it but it roused their curiosity and excited their interest at st goar a boy fell into the river aind would have been drowned had it not been for the courage and skill of the mysterious count who calmly glided after him and

were in vain but chance having twice thrown him in the way of the mysterious count he at length succeeded in gaining his confidence and was rewarded by being entrusted with the secret of his life the inevitable packet of letters which extinguishes the hero of the introduction to a romance was put into his hands and he was good enouggh to frame from them the narrative which forms the main part of

the shadow of ashlydyat by mrs henry wood 3 vols bentleywe consider the shadow of ashlydyat to be the best novel that mrs wood has written it has not the romantic and painful interest of  east lynne but it is a better constructed story and for  steadily accumulating interest where the reader is made to feel every character and incident real and true as if it had come under his personal knowledge we do not know a novel of the present day to be compared with it the power to draw minutely and carefully each character with characteristic individuality in word and action is mrs woods especial gift this endows her pages with a vitality which carries the reader to the end and leaves him with the feeling that the veil which in real life separates man from man has been raised and that he has for once seen and known certain people as intimately as if he had been their guardian angel thisisa great fascination it is not produced by means of metaphysical analysis or philosophical insight mrs wood rarely ventures on a general observation and never goes into metaphysics but she steadily minds her business tells her story carefully and completely and works out her characters with an instinctive knowledge of what they would say and do under the given circumstances which is never at fault her writing resembles good french acting for the skill and care she bestows upon her details without giving them undue prominence at first the number of characters in ashlydyat and the variety of interests introduced may seem likely to prove perplexing but every personage and every incident is so carefully drawn and the threads of the story are kept so distinct that the reader is never oppressed or confusedthe web of conflicting interests is skilfully woven the readers entertainment is well cared for and never flags throughout the story the story concerns the fortunes of the godolphin family who live and have lived for many generations in a stately old house called ashlydyat which with its lands was formerly church property there is a tradition that so long as the godolphins remain in ashlydyat they will be prosperous but if they quit it their ruin will follow also there is a strange unaccountable phenomenon which appears whenever misfortune or death is approachinga shadow which has the aspect of a bier with coffin and mourners in the midst of a graveyard full of tombstones  and this shadow comes over a bare uncultivated portion of land where there is nothing to throw a shadow or t account for the strange appearance this shadow recurs in the story like the refrain of an old ballad and mrs wood assures the reader that this appearance is not her own invention but that the  shadow as well as the chief portions of the story are true of course very few of the people most concerned believe in the superstition  amongst the rest lady godolphin sir georges second wife is the most obstinate of the sceptics she hates the sombre stately old place and insists upon building a pleasant villa at a little distance contriving to take her husband away to live in it when finished this seems to be the first step towards the declension of the family fortune s  but the old prophecy is so skilfully blended with the practical results of individual conduct that it has the effect of an old greek fate unless wc were to write out the whole book we could not give an account of the story there are so many characters each following his own devices yet so linked together by circumstances that a bald outline of the tale would convey no idea of the book sir george godolphin has been at the head of a longestablished bankone of those old county banks in which the surrounding country believes far more devoutly than in the bank of england after sir georges death the younger son being a full partner gets into the hands of verrall the moneylender a cleverly indicated character by his means and the blandishments of a questionable young lady miss charlotte pain young godolphin is led on to ruin and to crime this sounds common place enough but it is in the working out of this main fact and in the variety of incidents involved that the strength and charm of

the novels of mrs aphra behn with an introduction by ernest baker routledge  sons a curious fate has been that of aphra afra aphara ayfara or according to a humble  peticion  to charles ii written from gaol fyharebehn dramatist romancer poet and incidentally government spy the astrea of pope the first english female writer to live by her pen and according to oldyslikely from his bibulous habits to be an authority on the subjectthe introducer into england of milkpunch she has left behind her apart from her published or acted works few trustworthy memories her origin is a matter of dispute according to accepted biographies she was of aristocratic birth and surroundings her father whose name was johnson member of a family established in canterbury being a relative of lord willoughby by whose interest he was appointed lieutenantgeneral of surinam and sixandthirty islands for this parentage there seems to be some foundation since it was on a voyage to the west indies for the purpose of entering on the duties in question that johnson died in common with the rest of her family aphra settled in surinam where her adventurous career began as though she had not names enoughand most if not all of the variants assigned her were accepted and employed by herself  the appellation astrea bestowed upon her by her admiring contemporaries was advanced by langbaine as her real name it was not until the 6th of september 1884 that the accuracy of the accepted biographies was called seriously into question in the athenaum of that date appeared a letter from mr edmund gosse to whom is due the memoir in the  dictionary of national biography chronicling the discovery in the register of wye in kent of an entry of the baptism on the 10th of july 1640 of ayfara daughter of john johnson a barber and of amy his wife on the strength of this notice mr gosse assumes that the alleged parent was a more distant relative whom she called father if we accept this theory for what it is worth the question is suggested whether the relations between lord willoughby and aphra if parental were necessarily legitimate it is possible that an investigationwere the matter of sufficient importanceof the records of surinam or dutch guiana might throw some light upon it on the cession of surinam to the dutch aphra who had lived at st johns hill the best house in the colonyreturned to london where a few years later she married behn a dutch merchant through whom she is said to have gained admittance at court in 1666 after his death she was sent as a secret agent to the netherlands returning thence when on the point of contracting second nuptials which however fell through owing to the death of her lover she was wrecked losing her entire property and narrowly escaping with her life the secret whioh in the course of her flirtations she had surprised of the intention of the dutch to sail up the thames and burn the english ships in the medway was derided at court her applications for a payment she had well earned were refused she appears to have been lodged in gaol for debt and found herself compelled to seek a living by her pen the tragedies with which she approached the stage were unsuccessful and it was not until she produced comedy after comedy licentious in intrigue and coarse in dialogue but possessed of a certain measure of vivacity and spirit that she won recognition during a literary career which lasted for something under a quarter of a century she acquired the intimacy of dryden killigrew tate otway and the wits of the day and when in 1689 she died owing to the ignorance of her physician she found a restingplace in poets corner westminster abbey where on a slab of marble her name may still be read the irony of fate thus pursued her to the end and the woman whose name not too justly has become a byword in such state doth lie as has been vainly demanded for more than one of the greatest poets of following centuries it was at surinam that aphra made the acquaintance of oroonoko the african prince whose adventures she narrates in the bestknown of her romances how much of the story she tells is fact and how much fiction is as doubtful as are most other things connected with her life and proceedings the novelist was credited by her contemporaries with intimate and dishonouring relations with her hero a gratuitous and wildly improbable suspicion for never surely did an amorous woman depict a successful rival in colours so bright as those bestowed upon imoinda the inspirer of oroonokos passion and the sharer in his fate seven years after mrs benns death the story of oroonoko was dramatised by thomas southerne who afterwards expressed his regret at having coupled so touching a theme with comic scenes of extreme coarseness southernes tragedy was thrice amended or imitated a pale and colourless rendering by dr hawkesworth being lukewarmly defended by jdr johnson from one or other of these dramatisations the popular idea if such can be said to exist of oroonoko is drawn the fable itselfwe leave the reader to accept the word in whichsoever sense it commends itself to himbelongs wholly to mrs behn and to her is due the credit of finding in a fugitive african slave a subject for romance at a period when the choice by shakespeare of a moor as a hero was being seriously rebuked that there is a basis of fact in the story of  oroonoko or the royal slave will not be seriously disputed the narrator claims to have been an eyewitness of the deeds she recounts and asserts  what i could not be witness of i received from the mouth of the chief actor in this history the hero himself who gave us the whole transactions of his youth she states also that she had had presented to her a set of feathers such as were converted into dresses adding what is credible enough that she gave them to the kings theatre  it was the dress of the indian queen infinitely admired by persons of quality and was inimitable a costume of the sort is characteristic it might be supposed of the aborigines of the island rather than of the african importations with whom they had nothing in common except experience of european treachery cruelty and deceit it is the indians of whom mrs behn speaks rather than africans when she says that such is their respect for truth and ignorance of falsehood that when the english governor who had pledged himself to meet them failed either to come or to send a message they mourned and fasted for the death which alone could as they assumed have caused his absence oroonoko himself is described as a black a perfect ebony or polished jet with eyes  the most awful that could be seen a nose  rising and roman and a mouth firmly shaped and with no signs of the thick lips of the negro his sentimental adventures may be assumed to be in part imaginative but his death in circumstances of revolting cruelty after heading a servile revolt has nothing that offends probability mrs behn is then to be credited with being among the first to denounce the horrors and atrocities of slavery had the whole of her novels been as simple and direct as this story they would have taken a permanent place in literature the more serious of them are however extravagant in action and commonplace in style most of them bear traces of foreignprobably spanishinfluences and some must be accepted as translations those which are of unmistakably home growth are like the comedies of the author more noticeable for licence than for any other quality in the king of bantam which is the most original as well as the most amusing the action is placed in a world such as we meet with in wycherley and the story exhibits the manner in which people represented as perfectly worthy and estimable and of established position plot successfully to extort from a rich and foolish dupe a portion for a deserving but dowerless maiden were anything new to be said concerning the immorality prevalent in restoration times justification for it might be herein found t with the life and writings generally of mrs behn it is superfluous to concern ourselves her plays a further reprint of which would be welcome constitute her chief claim to literary rank a few of her poems have won recognition her  love in fantastic triumph sat is in the best of recent anthologies and one or two other pieces such as her elegiac verses on waller have won recognition mrs benns unsavoury reputation is warranted it is probable however that less would have been heard concerning her delinquencies had scotts story concerning the old lady who borrowed her novels and was shocked with what had once given her pleasure been less widely circulated mr bakers introduction deals with the plays rather than the tales but is adequate the edition of the tales is popular rather than scholarly but we are grateful to messrs routledge for their enterprise in giving us this and other halfforgotten books we do not notice the species of memoir or apology by a devoted female admirer which seems to have accompanied some editions and which little trustworthy as it is has great interest and is principally responsible for the views that subsist as to the novelists life a bibliography of mrs benns writings would have been a welcome addition to the reprint which a facsimile of early titlepages and the like would have brought up to modern requirements mrs behn and ravenscroft like herself a dramatist lived on terms cf literary and domestic intimacy to what extent they collaborated is a matter into which it is now presumably too late to inquire,englishfiction

these lands entered in their own charters and took forcible possession as opportunitifs occurred these encroach menta of course the gregors resisted and the resistance was by their powerful enemies replvaented at court as acts of invasion and robbery mary and her son james alike legislated against them in the dracospirit of the times and finally forbade the use of the very name and assembling together of more than four at a time mingling rather than merging in the neighbouring clans they in consequence became drummonds buchan ans campbells c in name but continued gregors still in heart and still unitable for clan purposes in the civil wars they in commonswith other higihanders why should they fight with each other when the war opened lowlanders to plunder they adopted the royal cause and at the restoration had influence enough to get the iniquitous statutes against them repealed but not enough to keep them so their reenactment was speedily smuggled in again but the enemies of the

explanatory introduction is occupied not now in communicating any details as to the origin of the 1 abbot or its object or again in ob viating and defending as was the case with the  monastery but with a statement or suggestion of the motives which on its first appearance prompted a speedier publication than usual the monastery and the abbot were but parts of one subject and of course less time was spent in search of a new story but the authorconsidering the monastery in some respects as a failure though he had no serious alarms of any fatal or permanent effects upon his po pularity thought it good policy to hasten t6 fetch up his leeway not to advance was in some sort to recede and he felt it to be of some importance still to show by a fresh and more successful effort that the failure was rather the effect of an illchosen subject than an illmanaged story he was not as he says in his own happy way one of those like fashionable publishers by the way who are willing to suppose the brains of an author are a kind of milk which will not stand above a single creaming and of course did not despair in sending the abbot forth so soon after the monastery as he did he acted like

miss balmaines past by b m croker 66 cbatto this would be a passably good story if we could believe it but it keeps hitting tip against reality and credibility all the time and gets much bruised and battered miss balmaines  past  was a foolish not a bad one she had made a secret marriage when very young and her husband left for foreign parts immediately to make his fortune and hers he was wrecked on a desert island where his beard grew and his skin was tanned so that when he was delivered some few years after and returned to england to claim a title his young wife did not recognise him meanwhile the child born to them was spirited away by the young wifes wicked mother and was growing up neglected when his father found him quite by accident feeling an affinity he adopted him the best possible opportunities were given to miss balmaine to recognise the identity of her lost husband and lord airdrie but for the purposes of miss crokers story she persisted in her stupidity and played the part of the haughty rejecter of all offers for hdr hand because of an embittered past everything in the story fits in cleverly to an improbable situation and as situation is everything and characters and workmanship in this novel to much below the usual level of miss crokers powers hardly count at all when the plot fails to satisfy there is little to fall back upon for interest or amusement  miss balmaines past by b m croker chatto  windus though not among the best of mrs crokers now numerous novels miss balmaines past is decidedly readable and though there are certain difficulties lu the plot a decidedly enjoyable story it is practically a story of today with only occasional references to the angloindian subjects with which readers of mrs crokers stories are familiar the writer sets herself the task of separating a husband and wife in circumstances which make it natural that the lady should fail to recognise the man and that the man should refrain from revealing his identity to his wife and we fear the effort is too great for mrs crokers constructive abilities we will not divulge the details of the plot which is sufficiently interesting to be spoilt by recital but it is necessary to point out that the writer seeks to support her theory by saying of the hero  his antecedents were wrapped in mystery but when a man is rich titled and unmarried people are not too searching in their inquiries these elements would we should have thought rather serve to stimulate the inquiries in question nevertheless the story is wholesome and interesting  and it deserves recognition as a work of honest literary effort and unquestionable attraction on one page we notice an accident to the type which should have been corrected and in another place the epithet  moonflooded as applied to a landscape would have been better omitted,englishfiction

broken to harness a story of english domestic 81 life new novels by edmund yates 3 vols maxwell co to the readers of the magazine edited by mr edmund yates and to his fellowworkers in literature there is no need to say that  broken to harness resembles its author in being strong manly and good at heart it ia a first novel and a better work of fiction has not for many a week come under om notice from beginning to end we have read it with lively interest and we lay it aside with an agreeable sense of refreshment and increased strength readers of every class will find in the story a liberal fund of amusement and there are those who on closing the third volume will thank the author for certain wise lessons and many tine pictures taken as a whole it is a mons novel dealing far more with bohemia clubrooms and masculine absurdities than with though refinements and graces of womans life but though it ia a  mans novel women will relish it  for throughout its diverse scenes there is a chivalric and unobtrusive recognition of feminine goodness moreover there is not even in its revelations of bohemia a single line that will raise a blush or jar upon the sensitive ear  broken to harness to what object does the title apply 1 a colt long in leg and big in bone ignorant of the collar and fresh from the marsh now for the first time put in training for roadwork  a luckless hunter that having come to grief in a steeplechase has fallen in mans esteem and is condemned henceforth to draw the van instead of following the hounds  a steed of purest pedigree but by reason of some defect from which stainless descent cannot insure immunity deemed unfit to contend for though honours of the turf a highbred dainty filly sentenced after a brief day of triumph in  the row to run between the shafts of a butchers cart or drag the phaeton of a country parson literally to none of these but figuratively to the last young ladies who dance through the season in the best  sets of may fair may shudder at the bare thought of being broken to harness and may scout the possibility that fortune will require them to put their shoulders to domestic wheels and tug away at cumbrous family coaches that stern lot however awaits the greater number of them  and in mr yatess novel they may read how one of their gentle kind and high degree was after much trouble on the part of her trainer and in spite of her skittish ways and high temper put through the manege and broken to harness the poor girl who is subjected to this indignity is barbara lexden penniless niece of a wicked old aunt whose income and place in the world of fashion make up the list of her virtues barbara has been well introduced and ably chaperoned she has made a hit and achieved rank as a reigning helle  and her aunt expects great things of her barbara herself is not disinclined to play the high game indeed she has set her heart on making a grand matchan ambition by no means rare amongst really beautiful young women who stand at one of lifes gamblingtables staking their wit and beauty against the wealth and rank of richer competitors  offers she had had in plentyyouthful peers with slender incomes middleaged commoners solemn wealthy dull    but barbara refused them all she told her aunt that she was playing for a high stake but instead of playing the game out barbara like many girls who would be selfish and worldly if their better natures would permit them ceases to care about the high stake and turns away from the green cloth with a modest prize instead of marrying a rich peer she becomes the wife of frank churchill a journalist on the staff of a daily newspaper who has no connexion whatever with the world in which barbara is accustomed to move franks father was an unsuccessful artist in poverty frank picked up his education at a country school and a german university  and when he falls in love with barbara he is living with his old mother in great adullam street which as scarcely anybody knows is a street lying between grays inn gardeas and mecklenburg square indeed barbara and frank churchill are separated by so wide a bar of social circumstances that mr yates feels it necessary to explain with much care how it was that they were guests in the same country house such a coincidence of highborn beauty and obscure toil is by no means usual but the author accounts for it satisfactorily and manages his story so well that when barbara throws her grand wicked old aunt over and in spite of protests and expostulations becomes the wife of a poor journalist readers do not feel that she is acting otherwise than naturally and in accordance with everyday experience after the wedding comes the honeymoon after that the flood of tears and regrets it is a gloomy hour for barbara when she makes her first entrance into frank churchills house in great adullam street from which humble unattractive dingy dwelling franks mother has retreated in order that the bride may feel herself mistress of her own house she is in harness  but though she begins to work with a good will her pride rebels and the weariness of her days whilst her husband is working away from home is too much for her powers of endurance of course the distance between grays inn road and park lane cuts her off from her old friends  and she is offended by such society as frank can procure for her the pipesmoking artists jealous authors and noisy bohemians who spend their evenings in his study are not persons to her taste  and she is even less pleased by their illdressed wives and chattering daughters other sources of trouble arise barbara and franks mother pull against each other  and through the malice and idleness of lookerson mutual jealousy springs up between husband and wife at last after many outbreaks of temper on the part of barbara and after a trifling display of injustice and violence on franks part the younga wife flies from great adullam street and seeks shelter in the house of a married lady how she is brought to repent this hasty step  how frank learns to judge her more leniently  how grief and the prickings of conscience bring her humbly to his side  how he acknowledging his own misconduct whilst he pardons hers takes her again to his arms  and how she is at last  broken to harness and runs merrily on thinking herself lucky in having fallen into the hands of a skilful and merciful trainerare matters about which the reader must learn from mr yates himself the ending of the tale does not quite please us frank churchill ought not to have obtained that legacy and commissionership in the tintax office  the fitness of things requires that he should by hard work in his own profession have raised himself to prosperity and power and barbara as mistress of a house in russell square ought to have made the discovery that life in mesopotamia may be and in many cases is quite as happy and gracious and refined as lifo in belgravia but our disappointment in this respect does not make us unjust to mr yates an historian must be truthful and as barbaras husband became a great man and a rich one in official circles and as she saw fit to live in a pretty villa on the banks of the thames what can mr yates do but state that such was the case apart from barbaras troubles the story contains much good matter the sketches of the clublife of authors and artists are capital enough has been said of mr yatess cleverness and power  but we have scarcely done justice to the unaffected amiability and manliness  that are amongst his most agreeable qualities,englishfiction

love the criminal bv j b harris burland greening  co the author shows himself a practised hand in the concoction of sensational fiction he leads off with a quotation from oscar wildes  de profundis dealing with love and suffering the love with which we are here concerned is sheer sexual passion untempered by intellectuality unrefined by those qualities which make true love not an  explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world but an explanation of the fortitude and cheerfulness with which much of lifes suffering is endured the book is a perfectly frank piece of melodrama and should find favour with a considerable circle for it is packed full of incident and of physical as well as emotional stress and storm the characters form the old triangle  a woman at one corner and a man at each of the other corners both of them passionate in desire of the woman and one of them unscrupulously so upon the whole the villain of the piece has the better time we think but there is a suggestion of poetic justice in arcadia at the end  love the criminal fiction by j b harrisburland greening 6s we confess to a certain pity for mr harrisburland by writing glorified pennydreadfuls at the outset of his career he has caused his name to be associated in the mind of every critic if not of every reader with glorified pennydreadfuls and nothing more it is a thousand pities for this book though it is in parts artless enough shows that he possesses real ability it is by way of being something of a  shocker  but it is a good  shocker and it is not too shocking for any ordinary not overmorbid young lady to read in bed mr harrisburland strains the long arm of coincidence a good deal in order to get his effects and his effects are not always quite what he intends them to be but we admit that his book entertained us mightily that we resented having to put it aside before we reached the end when he has learned restraintand occasionally he is restrainedhe will write a much better book than the one before us though it will probably be less successful from the point of view of royalties we deplore his excesses because they spoil what might have been a fine novel but his characterisation as a whole is admirable and we have nothing but praise for those chapters in which he takes us to sea mr harrisburland with a friend to restrain him could write a noteworthy book,englishfiction

fiction mir alemeres elopement by charles marriott nash 6s in reflecting upon this talethe maturest the most masterful and perhaps the most significant that mr charles marriott has yet writtenone is almost irresistibly attracted to the question of the relative potential effects of i energy and 2 mass upon the momentum and the staying power of a novel in handling this themewhich deals with the effect upon her own and a few other lives of t wifes rebellion and desertion of her husbandmr marriott is lavish of energy devoting it to a resolute concentration upon the matter in hand to the exclusion of almost everything else and bringing his tale to a conclusion sufficiently complete in some three hundred octavo pages of fairly large print that is to say it occupies about half the space of mr henry james  the golden bowl a book the very mention of which almost provokes a study in contrasts in how leisurely a manner does the prince in that tale saunter on to the stage that is unobtrusively but carefully prepared for him how deliberately he stops before a bond street window strolls on again eventually pays a cali all the time it is true the author is revealing him letting him reveal himself turning light upon a facet here and there but all so quietly with such an air almost of abstraction that though you cannot miss the fact that you are in the very midst of the stress of life you may easily miss the perception of the moments which are dominating great issues in comparison with all this the sudden appearance in mr marriotts opening page of sherring and umney before the door of 29 sidney gardens in hot pursuit of dick feddon has almost the effect of the entry of puppets so vigorously do they proceed to take up their allotted parts and discover their characteristics not that mr marriotts writing is really spasmodic or even hurried if his puppets are highly geared they are thoroughly well oiled he merely has them trained to the highest degree of efficiency they gallop as it were like horse artillery fully equipped into action each character bringing his motives views of life and estimate of the situation to bear upon the tale at long or short range as the case may be tnere is no doubt that at first such a method carries all before it the rapid introduction to a succession of active intellects all busily employed stimulates the reader and rivets his attention so that he cares little to discover the showman working the wires though more than a glimpse of himself his wit and his prejudices is to be had for the looking but upon a second perusal when all the plot is known do not all these various clever mental anatomiesstand out a little bare to the view  compare all the colloquies between evelyn alemere sweet light and alluringand the boy she is tricking compare again the sarcastic collofuies between feddons mother and her advisers with all those wonderful interwoven subtly significant conversations in mr james book it will be seen that while the younger writer brings a widening knowledge of life to bear upon his story the elder allows his story to flow broadly through a wide knowledge of life and so brings his readers before broad and spacious horizons to the contemplation of which they may return again and again it would of course be as absurd to criticise mr marriott for what he does not attempt to do as to suggest that any long novel is likely to be better than any short one moreover we cordially admire such choice effective brevity as that which can so movingly put the whole tragedy of archdales life upon a single page yet we think that if a man have the stuff in him  mass  makes for permanence and we believe too that were mr marriott to give himself more room he would lose a certain occasional air of halfveiled rancour towards his meaner personages which is not the most admirable of many admirable qualities  mrs alemeres elopement by charles marriott jnashj mr marriott has gone far in  mrs alemeres elopement towards the fulfilment of the high expectations raised by his former novels his style is less laboured his manner of narration stronger his touch in characterdrawing more sure what is not so welcome is the cynicism that pervades the book evelyn alemere beautiful refined and passionate leaves her husbands roof with richard feddon a young musician with something of the knightly temperament who is as certain of her purity as her loveliness there is nothing in their relations to disturb his idealistic admiration of her but she induces him to allow the divorce proceedings brought by her husband to go undefended and secretly marries a former lover immediately she is free mrs alemere is a very clever and interesting study though here and there it is somewhat marred by a lack of consistency that this sirenlike creature should be treated in a cynical mood is not unnatural but unfortunately there is scarcely one character in the book that is drawn sympathetically mrs feddon who looks with haughty disapproval upon the escapades of her quixotic son is made to cut an undignified figure in a particularly cruel scene and rose archdale the only woman in the story who has escaped the contempt of the author is rather too cold and reserved to be really attractive mr marriotts male creations do not fare much better at his hands than do the women they are nearly all foolish meddlesome and vain,englishfiction

the young stijmwther a chronicle of mis takes by the author of  thc heir of red clytie c parker son  bourn there is about as much reading in this one volume as in three ordinary threevolume novels and no one can complain that in making an investment in thc young stepmother they have not got their moneys worth of paper for their money it would fill up a month of wet days in a country house it is impossible not to become to a certain degree interested in the detail of the daily life of the luckless young stepmother and yet it is real hard work to follow her through thc minute history of every day and almost of every hour of the day in her dreary uphill task of humanising her stepchildren and taming and softening their melancholy morose father albinias is a fine charactercourageous impetuous full of life and spirit with a restless craving for  work and an unlimited supply of energy and goodnature full of ardour for  something to do she leaves her bright and happy home in her brothers parsonage where she is adored both by himself and his merry little irish wife for the sake of consoling an inconsolable elderly widower in weak health of a gloomy temperament residing in a damp dark unwholesome house in a dull country town and possessing three of the most odious children it has ever been our fate to meet with either in a book or in real life at first albinia looks forward with hope and resolution to her future fate she intends to cure her husband of giving vent to suppressed sighs and speaking in a voice of subdued melancholy she makes up her mind that she  could bear to have his late wifes memory first with him and she kuows she  could not compensate to him for his loss but trusts that in time he may appear a little less dejected she vainly tries to coax the sulky schoolboy with a toothache into goodhumour to put sense into the foolish affected gossipping lucy even hopes in time to make something out of the languid sickly sophia with her downcast looks and forbidding manner nothing can be more un promising than her commencement though gilbert takes a fancy to her and soon becomes quite  her pet he is weak untruthful and fond of low company lucy gossips away right and left makes mischief between albinia and the meadowses mother and sister of the first mrs kendal and spreads reports of her stepmothers sayings and doings all over bayford as for sophy she baffles all attempts at sociability and till in the course of a year or two she half kills albinias baby and nearly breaks her own neck she remains as perverse and moody as before worried and dispirited mr kendal gives happiness up as a bad job and retires to his study where he locks his door upon all intrudershis young wife includedand takes heed of nought that passes in his uncongenial household out of doors things are very little better the town is dirty and fevers abound the pond exhales thick poisonous vapours the neighbours are secondrate and meddlesome the meadows family interfering and censorious and the children aggravating after her first confinement poor albinia completely breaks down in health and spirits and her brother and sisterinlaw come to her assistance they keep her quiet rouse mr kendal get gilbert sent off to a private tutors and take lucy away with them on a visit winifred takes the opportunity of telling sophy in very plain terms what she thinks of her conduct and maurice fills up the obnoxious pond and from that hour matters improve with the young stepmother then the elderly miss meadows marries a former lover of the days of her youth and the old lady is imported into the house at willow banka great infliction in itself but a blessing inasmuch as she deprives mr kendal of his beloved study and thereby obliges him to consort more with the rest of the family backed up by her brother and mr dusantoy thc excellent clergyman of bayford albinia next induces her husband to take a little interest in public affairs and he becomes in time a churchwarden a magistrate and a useful man of business in the parish the stepchildren gradually grow up and cause much anguish and tribulation of mind to poor mr kendal by falling iu love with all the wrong people lucy makes what is called a good marriage and is wedded to a rich man and a conceited fool in spite of the indignant remonstrances and tearful entreaties of albinia gilbert becomes enamoured of a fascinating french teacher who wins the hearts of all the young men within her reach and is really a charming little thing and deservedly beloved by everybody in the book poor ugly morbid sophy forms an attachment to a rollicking young irishman but ulick omoore has the good taste to prefer genevieve and sophy finds out she has chosen the human and left the divine and makes up her mind to be a very hardworking old maid and takes to albinias children and makes herself generally useful in the world of course poor mrs kendal takes blame to herself for everything that goe3 wrong and her feelings of remorse at every slight contretemps are bitter and exaggerated her brother endeavours to persuade her that although she may have made a few blunders here and there still take it all in all she has faithfully and earnestly done her best and the result lies in other hands than her own this is we presume the moral of the book but we have our doubts whether these kind of books good and useful as they doubtless are in many ways for young ladies who are not allowed to peruse regular novels may not tend to encourage in others too close a scrutiny into the various shades of their own and their neighbours characters each little failing merit tendency or habit is here examined under a powerful microscopic lens and analysed and commented on till one becomes fairly confused as to the relative degrees of right and wrong and if the plan be acted upon and carried out in real life the process can scarcely be a wholesome one to a young mind the young stepmother is far from being so interesting as  heartsease or  though heir of kedlyffe but it is much of the same calibre as dynevor terrace and the daisy chain and as such will we have no doubt meet with its circle of

minor notices them boots by william gilbert daldy isbister  i i i   and cothe reader may always be sure in taxing up any book by mr william gilbert of getting some thing very clever and original and will probably when putting it down again le inclined to wonder why so very clever and original a writer has not made a greater success mr gilbert like the author who writes under the names of matthew brown and henry holbeach can do a great many things well and has a very large circle of admirers but both have failed somehow or other to hit the taste of the great big stupid public as thackeray called it when mr gilbert published  shirley hall the book received the most enthusiastic praise from reviewers and certainly deserved all the praise it got the grim painful realism of the story was admirably sustained and very free from exaggera tion there was something of the power of defoe apparent in it but it failed to become popular and there are few among the subscribers to mudies we should imagine who ask for  shirley hall asylum now to take another example of mr william gilberts versatile talent king georges middy was certainly one of the best fantastic childrens books of the day but it perhaps overshot its mark by being too thoughtful or too fantastic or perhaps it was overshadowed by the appearance of the immortal alice books but it seems to have had the same result with children 19  shirley hall with their fathers and mothersit pleased the more thoughtful and failed to hit the general public what fate attends mr gilberts new book we cannot venture to predict it might be roughly described as a  temperance  tract and most works in favour of what is known as the  temperance movement command a large audience but then it is exceedingly clever which very few works of the kind are and this may tell against it the story whose name and in some sense its motif may remind its readers of thackerays  fatal boots treats of the inhabitants of an institution on the surrey side of the thames estab lished  for the reception comfort and reformation of the female ticket ofleave convict thus it will be seen that mr gilbert has made choice of a scene and of characters at once unifamiliar and unattractive to the readern of 1 the style of novels and tales now so much in fashion representing almost exclusively the habits and manners of the socalled upper or genteeler classes one of these ticketofleave women steals a pair of boots  them boots and comes to the belief that  them loots are enchanted and lead their wearer to drink anl disgrace the way in which this idea is heightened in the minds of the various other women is admirably donle and gives the little story a weirdly fantastic effect wit shout any direct appeal to the supernatural worthy of ny fantastic writer from hoffmann downwards while tlvh different characters chiefly ticketofleave women who figure in the story are very powerful genre studies as a work with a purpose them boots may not have inul i effect but as a fresh and vigorous work of art it is dleserving of high praise,englishfiction

the kin ff with two faces new novels by m e cole ridge arnold miss coleridge has written a clever and in many respects interesting novel dealing with sweden and with paris in the early days of the french revolution the most attractive part of the book is that which deals with count fersen whose family name is referred to in dialogue as having been macpherson and his brave attempt to rescue the french king and marie antoinette the least attractive element is the curiously staccato style which the writer adopts it must be admitted that the mannerism is consistent throughout and that it is often used with good effect we notice that miss coleridge expresses obligation to mr nisbet bains  gustav iii and his contemporaries her story which is long and substantial deserves a high place among the class of fiction to which it is allied  the king with two faces by m e coleridge a breathless romance in the style of dumas by the author of the seven sleepers of ephesus  four horses saddled and bridled stood ready this note of haste and emergency is well kept up pageants glow and pistol shots flash through these pages and melodrama is exhausted we gather however that the story is founded on facts in mr nisbet bains gustav iii and his contemporaries edward arnold 421 pp 6s  the king with two faces by m e coleridge arnold the keynote of this thoughtful and finely written story is struck firmly in the first chapter and it isaction hardly a page passes without its momentous event or its deed of derringdo the king is gustav id of sweden the two faces the opposing tendencies towards democracy and absolutism that existed together in this strange inconsistent lovable man from this inner conflict spring the outer conflicts that fill the book to this its pathos of despairing ideals and loyal infidelities is due the climax of the narrative is in the last two years of gustavs reign 17889 when he who had faithfully accepted the popular constitution of 1772 came to bid it defiance and as a result ended his life by assassination gustav overshadows the book but the immediate hero is count adolf ridding a courtier devoted heart and soul to the twofold service of king and country no service or feat of daring is too hard for adolf if called upon by gustav for sweden and the ruin of his faith in his master is the more tragic when gothenburg was besieged by the danes and on the point of surrender it was adolf who volunteered at the risk of his life to blow up the bridge and so keep out the imminent danger he wins the kings gratitude  nevertheless his sweetheart tala is coveted by baron essen and as the price of essens support to the royal cause adolf is sent to practical banishment at pans here he comes under the influence of mme de stael and tala hearing slanderous reports of his relations with that lady marries the rival suitor after the ignominious flight of louis xvi and marie antoinette to versailles adolf returns to sweden he finds gustav on the path of despotism and the people ripe for revolt sick and sore at heart he becomes implicated m a plot to kill the king at a masquerade and in this attempt the interest of the novel culminates the king is wounded and adolf who still loves him hides in the sickchamber to behold him once more here he is witness of an interview between gustav and his brother the duke of sudermania in which the king demands pardon for the rebels the scene is effectively told and we quote it as a favourable example of miss coleridges manner   i could promise he said at last low and unwillingly  for all but one you would not have the murderer set free to slay the son as he has slain the father p the king seemed to reflect a moment it was the thin strange voice that spoke again now in utter weariness and exhaustion  for all the rest you promisebefore god   for all the rest i promise repeated the duke as if the words were dragged out of him before god 4 before god adolf was fiercely torn in two had he stood in the dukes place he must have yieldedhe knew that yet he despised him his brother his own brotherand he could let him go thus lightly  must he adolf ridding accept his life from such a fellow as this   you have talked more than you ought good night brother  i am better the cough is gone i shall sleep now good night the duke stole out with hushed footsteps the wind had fallen suddenly as it does sometimes before dawn and the circles and patches of light upon the ceiling did not waver to adolfs fancy their steadi ness made the quiet room quieter still it seemed to him that long hours ebbed away if sleep depended upon silence surely the king must sleep the painful sound of his had ceased altogether a chill struck home to adolfs heart was he dead  he could not stay there he must look he rose and peered cautiously round the screen by the subdued light of a little silver lamp covered with a paper shade he saw the great bed smooth and white and the shrunk face on the pillow the dedclothea were in perfect order the hand that lay half open on the coverlet looked scarcely like a human thing ah what a ruin of a man was this adolf came a step forward his youth rushed back upon him he remembered only that this man of all men that he had ever seen was the bravest he would have fallen on his knees and kissed those waxen fingers at that moment the kings eyes opened he raised himself upon his arm with a look of indescribable terrorthen fell back putting his hand to his heart tala had spent herself in vain it was not adolf s hand that had fired the shot but it was none the less adolf who killed him  i am not afraid of you now he whispered  come nearer have you forgiven  will you let me sleep p he looked up there was no fear in his eyes adolf saw thisand he could see no more for tears for the historical accuracy of miss coleridges work she makes her appeal to mr nisbet bains life of gustav iii its thorough workmanship and fine presentation of character speak for themselves miss coleridge should hold a high place among the rising school of romancewriters she has undeniable dramatic power and keeps her story throughout tenseperhaps even too tensewith emotion it is honest solid work with nothing flimsy about it and with here and there a touch of inspiration long as the book is the attention of the reader does not flag until the close and this being so the length is only an added attraction,englishfiction
i falkner lyle or the story of though wives new novels by mark lemon  3 vols hurst  blackett falkner lyle is a clever and interesting story it is well written  the tone is healthy there is no straining after sensational effect there is no false heroism in the book the tale is interesting in its various parts and the characters are all of them lifelike except perhaps bertha the beautiful who has a bitter bad temper and is a devil incarnate without the sense with which devils are usually accredited the story is a curious kaleidoscope of chances the merest accidents which in themselves are nothing neither fortunate nor the reverse according to the character to which they happen colour the destiny for good or ul falkner lyle the head boy at a large school falls in love with a beautiful girl the masters daughter he is on the point of entering upon a profession for several years he is faithful to his first love the girl is a very charming good girl but she does not give in

the reader is not told until quite the end of the story but falkner lyle himself goes away to india nursing his jealousy and disappointment and believing that his wife has been false with curious inconsistency he cherishes an ardent affection for the child though he resolves never to return to england ethel the object of his first passion grows up beautiful and excellent a devoted daughter to her father and by no means indifferent to the handsome youth who had loved her evil days come upon her father to please him and at his earnest  entreaty she consents to marry a man whom she does not love and who had been a schoolfellow with falkner lyle brownlow ethels husband proves to be a regular blackleg living by gambling and cheating at cards or rather increasing his income by these means for he had a private fortune the chief interest of the tale lies in the history of ethelher blameless life and her endeavours to be a good wife under difficult circumstances this part is very delicately managed her conduct secures the readers sympathy and the severest stickler for wifely duty will find no fault with her when she separates herself from her husband taking away the child when home becomes an unfit residence if she and falkner lyle had married things would have been far different his fine qualities and her virtues were now only like water spilled on the ground the wicked wife like a bad fairy devotes her life to mischief the old usher of the school and tom lazenby another schoolfellow like benevolent necromancers endeavour to neutralise her power falkner lyle comes back at last quite suddenly and clears up all mysteries and difficulties the wicked wife dies the bad husband is murdered by his confederates and all comes right at last we will not tell our readers any further particulars for the story of the two wives is so good that our friends should read it for themselves  falkner lyle  or the story of two wives new novels by mark lemon 3 vols hurst  blackett a man of genius will always show something of his peculiar gift wherever he sets his hand there at a glance is visible the impress of his individuality however trite the subject may have become by other peoples bungling attempts to fashion it into shape it reminds us very much of a horticultural show where prizes are offered for the best group of flowers all have had the same power of choice in making their nosegays but your attention is immediately arrested by the work of the exhibitor who has vindicated his claim to the reward it is the bold arrangement the happy contrasting the delicate suppression of what is coarse and vulgar the copy of nature leaving out her defectsin a word it is the whole perfect work which astonishes us why did we not see all this before  we could have added a hint or two to our own attempt and have beaten the prize bouquet no doubt but happily even in literature you cant steal hints without detection you may destroy an authors just profits by pirating his works but you cant filch his fame quite so easily  falkner lyle  is just such a novel as proves its author to be possessed of this power of superiority which we have tried to illustrate the plot is well conceived and skilfully developed the scene opens with a school and the proverb that the child is father of the man is painted for us in distinct colours almost every one who has been brought up at a large school can recall the actions of the boy which only too surely have ended in the follies and misfortunes not to use harsher terms of the man the hero of the tale  falkner lyle is an orphan with a crusty old bachelor uncle who lived in clubs and did did not want his nephews company falkner has to work for his future livelihood and studies accordingly tom lazenby and henry brownlow with ari under master named bumpstead with the head master and his daughter dr meriton and ethel are to be the dramatis personae brownlow is dismissed in disgrace for theft and still worse for trying to throw the blame on tom lazenby who is a goodnatured overgrown dunce a great friend of lyle falkner falls in love with ethel and his overtures are somewhat coldly received although he has a claim on the doctor by having saved him from an attack made by some highwaymen  please falkner lyle do not do thus any moree m is what we may call the  mittimus  offered him falkner becomes a mrcs having made a confident of old bumps the usher who gives a reason for his own selfneglect by recounting a terrible story of the disappointment which had soured his life he while young was also studying for the medical profession and what was called walking the hospitals going into the dissectingroom he there finds the body of his own lady love laid as a subject on the table it was in the days of resurrection men and not even intelligence of her death had previously reached him owing to the aversion of the father to the match he nearly goes mad imt recovers only to live without any care for the future falkner meets bertha clare the belle of a fashionable watering placean indian heiress and almost entirely her own ftmttk she is beautiful but utterly heart scorns the people with whom she retired from business bertha and marries him out of pique at the neglect shown her by charles marston whose sister is her great friend bertha compromises herself with marston and a separation is agreed to between herself and her husband she is to keep her daughter and her own fortune settled on herself falkner discovers that the child is very much neglected being put out to nurse and with the aid of old bumps steals her and deposits her with dr meritons household ethel being willing to take the charge of the infant falkner goes to india and meets with marston marston writes to rosa his sister and informs her that he has met falkner rosa conveys the news to bertha who rages at the thought of being outwitted by her husband and having lost a means of tormenting him falkner saves marstons life in india and is relieved by hearing that no reason for a divorce existed so far as marston was concerned between the husband and wife the scene is now laid at st gnats where miss carrington really bertha lyle and rosa marston and tom lazenby are residing near this town is the village of smallfield the curate of which place falls in love with a miss brownlow daughter of a widow lady residing with her mother miss betty eke a scandalmongering spinster forms one of the society to which we are introduced miss eke discovers the attachment of philip roy the curate to miss brownlow the railway panic arrives and the rector of the parish is ruined by speculation and by some extraordinary juggling the living is bought for philip by his aunt and miss carrington bertha discovers that mrs brownlow was her husbands first love and imagines that miss brownlow is really falkners daughter born out of wedlock she taunts mrs brownlow with her early sins as she calls the discovery the story goes back and describes dr  meritons illfortune and the marriage of ethel with brownlow the boy who stole at school and has been turned out of his club for cheating by means of a peculiarlymade pack of cards brownlows career of roguery is very interesting and we fear only too common a descent with manyhe is at length murdered by his confederates falkner at this point of the story turns up again ethel brownlows supposed daughter turns out to be the daughter of mr and mrs lyle bertha lyle is so enraged with her daughters not taking to heras nurses saythat she disappears in a fury and poisons herself leaving her money to charles marstoninsinuating a connexion between herself and captain marston to rplague her husband finally falkner marries his old love ethel and philip the curate marries adalyle the vindictive character of bertha is well worked out we think that the description of the blacklegs and their doings is perhaps the part of the book most true to nature the style is lively and agreeable the only improbable feature in the story is the malignant hatred of bertha the first wife  otherwise the  story of two wives  is not only very original but also a very natural production  falner lwyle or the story of two wives by mark  lemon in three volumes hurst and blackett there is a kindliness in all mr mark lemons novels that makes them very wholesome reading he has a heartless and determined woman for one of his heroines dogged enough to go all the way to india and back to ask a question that may help her in carrying a point spitefully and across the atlantic too upon the chance of finding some one else to answer her but our genial author good hater as this heroine is cannot make any one hate even her we rather pity the cold selfish bertha when she writhes in after life under the whips of those tormenting furies her own passions she is the wife incapable of love married to falkner lyle a man most capable of loving while the daughter of falkners good old schoolmaster she who was the idol of his schoolboy affection is the wife capable of love married for love of her father to a liar and a cheat and paying even to him all that is possible of wifely duty the good husband finds the good wife after many years but in the meantime hey suffer much one for marriage with a wife loved through the eyes only and the other for a marriage made from filial duty without hope of hearty wedded love the story opens at the school and some chief persons of it are first shown as schoolboys with their future characters already indicated as they pass from youth to manhood mysteries of life gather about them they have as we have said in mr mark lemon a wise and merciful interpreter the rascal brownlow to whom ethel is married has a redeeming feature in his love for her and is  almost  persuaded by her to be an honest man brimful of kindly humour is the sketch of the simplehearted school tutor mr bumps a forlorn middleaged man at the beginning of the story and its good genius throughout the old schoolmaster at the cedars dr meriton whom we see in his prime and in his decline is a tenderly drawn sketch the pictures of life are unstrained and various but always english there is middleclass home life not forgetting the scandalmaker citizen life england at the seaside at the picnic tourist abroad in the indian camp at the racecourse represented by men whom the gambling of the turf has trained to live by fraud here are some notes of a little dinner given in seaside lodgings by a turfy man and the fair lady of his choice to brownlow his brother crow and an unlucky mr roberts who is marked out for pigeon the preparations for this family dinner occupied mrs mallett during the remainder of the day and the lodgingbouse keeper was rather appalled at first by the amount of provender which continued to arrive until a late hour of the afternoon a little reflection however reconciled her to the importations as she knew that her own larder would be benefited by the profusion mrs mallett went to drem at four oclock and her toilette was hardly completed at a quarter to six when her husband came home to  beautify  as he called the operation of dressing mrs mallett really looked splendid  quite a queen shillibeer as mr mallettwhose omnibus knowledge was in advance of his biblicalsaid as he walked round her in admiration    the guests arrived and with commendable punctuality the dinner was announced nd served by the msn who cleaned the boots and shoes and ran of messages for the lodgers he was by profession a shoemaker but confinement and the odour of wax did not agree with him he said and waitering suited him better he was called waxy mrs mallett had been told by her husband to spare no expense and she had obeyed his injunction bhe had provided a small gastronomical museum the resources of the louse had been devoted entirely to the vegetables roasts and boils remembering vaguely some of the delicacies which had come within her knowledge during her days of servitude she bad contrived to impart an idea of the components of those dishes to a pastrycook who with a daring worthy of the cause undertook to produce thm the fish was a success being indigenous to the oast and dressed without pretension the soups four in number were rather gluey or oleaginouv having been purchased by the pound and warmed up in saucepans the astrdea were rather in exes mrs mallett having arranged three for each person as  she could not for the life of her she said  recollect what they were made of and as neither the maid jane nor waxy could pronounce one of the names written on the covers by the pastrycook there was quite a game of edible speculation going on while the entrees were in circulation mallett only increased the difficulty by challenging the gentlemen to take wine with him every five minutes and disturbed the selfpossession of waxy to such an extent that he nearly broke a bloodvenel in attempting to draw the cork of a champagne bottle without having fart cut the wire the two guests did their best to assist the progress of the dinner and cover the blunders but mrs mallett  on hospitable thoughts intent made matters

  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering has secretly loved her but he has exchanged into a regiment going to india to put himself out of the reach of temptation georgie has a cousin ida who is engaged to be married to another of the four friendsthe rev geoffrey luttrell an honest frank simplehearted sporting clergyman much more orthodox on points of shooting and salmonfishing than on divinity ida is a thoroughlywicked woman and the demon of the story she is madly in love with dering georgie has a narrow escape from the pranks of a vicious horse which she has wilfully insisted on mounting maurice dering saves her there is a capital description of the  race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief there is a certain gerald annesley a handsome blackguard who has known georgie in former times and who has stirred the first romantic feelings of her heart he renewb acquaintance with her and ida sets herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lovely face the lovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or satisfactory,englishfiction
the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,englishfiction
mutineers by arthur f j lapge 6s lane  mutineers  belongs to a class of books most difficult for a reviewer to do justice to he cannct te enthusiastic for he cot id have put the story aside at any page without regrc t and yet he must admire much of the workmanship the intelligence the conscientiousness the knowledge of life and hun nature displayed are exceptional there is not a spark of vivacity but to demand viracity is to demand a touch of genius and to crave that in every novel of this fictiongreedy age is absurd mr leg writes of life as many of us know it taday he is familiar with more than one circle of soci ty and recognises the state of fusion to which we are tending when pity for the poor breeds among luxury and socialistic literature is the favourite reading of legart persons 4mutineers is too violent a title most of the rebels hover timidly between two camps and are probably the more comprehensible to the average reader there are careful pictures of life in ifferent grades there are studies of character forcible in themselves though tfle personages do not group well in the story indeed the story is not very satisfactory it is a succession of incidents rather than a whole perhaps the writer shows himself to best advantage in a few beautiful descrptive passages lt no reader skip that really admirable picture of an august landscape will downs by the sea to be fcund on p 142 we wish we had room to quote it  mutineers by arthur e j legge john lane it is unfortunate that the title of this story should so closely resemble that of though preceding work for the books may be confounded by careless librarians and heedless readers mutineers is a very different story indeed from the mutineer it is not a romance but a novel moro properly socalled it does not deal with remote scenes but with english it is of the actual moment it deals with modern social matters taken stir le vlf it is wiso and witty and it sets forth character shrewdly observed and vigorously drawn though story is an ordinary story enough a young lady marries one man while loving anotherand of course after the marriage another begins to dangle and philander also there is a subsidiary story which mainly concerns a lower stratum of society but in the reading though story hardly matters for the book is of the sort in which the mind of the writer his views of life and his exposition of character aro all in all here is a passago in which though husband a silont and an apparently brutal person is shown in his true inward lighthe is riding in a steeplechase   meanwhile presterly was riding through the gloom with a stern expression on his rigid face the result of the race would mean something very like ruin to him  but still ho scarcely thought his mind was only bent on the recovery of gladys necklace he raced down the hill and cleared the fences and came so close together along the bottom he could still hear the beat of crusaders hoofs behind him    queen mab was still moving freely and jumping like a deer but the strain was boginning to tell upon her    he felt that queen mab was labouring under him both animals were beginning to fail but crusader was still creeping up surely the weight must do its work when they reached the hill but he began to feel doubtful queen mabs stride was shortening and hor head sinking lower he was riding for gladys necklace and he meant to winfairly or otherwise the fog was all around them the spectators were far away the other competitors were lost iu the obscurity behind if he won and an objection were lodged there would be no evidence to support it and his word was as good us gregsons as they rounded the bend he suddenly stoored into the middle of tho course carrying crusader with him gregson poured out a stream of fiery language but presterly took no notice with the same rigid look on his face he continued to bore and hustle though opposing horse as they approached though next fence gregson hurled a volley of threats  presterly uttered no sound but as he sat down to ride at the jump he pulled the mare deliberately across crusaders lino    there was a shock a crash of breaking twigs and horses and men rolled headlong on the turf beyond the fence up at though stand the crowd was waiting for some sign of the horses it seemed a long time since they had disappeared into the fog the party on the drag stood up and stared into the veil of obscurity at last the sound of hoofs came faintly to their ears a horseman gradually shaped himself out of the mist and wavered towards them what are the colours t exclaimed gladys eagerly  is it crusader or queen mab  lord st pancras dropped his cigar  it is neither he said one of the despised three was galloping past the winning post  a riderless horse followed    they recognised queen mab gladys pale face grew deadly white  i wonder what has happened  she murmured mutineers is a clever book a good book a book to read a second time for it

  dialstone lane by w w jacobs newnes there are perhaps three score of illustrations in this little volume and they are comic in much the same way as the halfpenny comic papers are said to be here is no vestige of the comedy referred to by meredith in his famous essay this is humour of the backslapping variety mr jacobss characters in this story have no more relation to real life than the figures in a harlequinade and they are given to frolics of a similar kind nevertheless even the reader with a genuine sense of humour may look to obtain some chuckles out of these pages but mr jacobs has done a good deal better it is a pity that he hankers after the portrayal of seafaring menof deepsea sailormen that isfor he appears to know little about them men with masters and mates certificates to lose are never the sort of comic pothouse idlers described here men of the bargee type do not obtain certificates and command oceangoing vessels but one feels kindly towards such a book knowing that it will heartily tickle a number of innocent people,englishfiction
  the sacred herb by fergus hume john jlong osj the sacred herb is a plant used in religious ceremonies by the inhabitants of easter island mr fergus humes story would lose half its point were we to give away the plot here it is enough to say that the herb plays a large part in the two murders which form the main interest of the book there are other mysterious properties a green domino and a jadehandled paper cutter while the characters in the story and they are many are more mysterious still of the real  villain  there is no doubt from the beginning slim dark with furtive eyes more than a dash of black blood and an unrequited passion for the lovely heroine there can be no question as to his character but whether he himself committed the murders is another matter and the secret is well kept until the end though belonging to a type of novel in which the plot is necessarily the main object the success of mr humes books has always depended to a great extent on his very lifelike characters  the sacred herb  is no exception to this rule though he has an unusually large cast each member of it is interesting and endowed with a distinct personality,englishfiction

the soul of lilith by miss marie corellt 3 vols richard bentley and sons novel which in a very few weeks after its publication is advertised by the publishers in ordinary to her majesty the queen as being in its fourth edition in threevolume form can at least claim to have hit the taste of a large por tion of the fictionreading public on this ground if upon no other miss corellis last book has a fair title to be considered one of the most notable novels of the past month this success has been attained it is said in spite of rough treatment by the critics whose notices have not been read by the present writer he has however seen a good many paragraphs in various journals describing with much insistence the anxiety displayed by the queen to read this book and the pleasure her majesty has derived from doing so how do they get about those paragraphs which crop up in all sorts of unlikely places giving all sorts of information about the comings and goings the actions and intentions of some writers no theory of spontaneous generation can be entertained for a mnoment it is unlikely that the most successful writer can have a paragraphist attached to his household to act the part played by the herald in a tourney miss corelli herself would appear to feel little gratitude to the press which she accuses in the book under notice of gross unfairness to literary woomen a successful novelist who is one of the female characters in  the soul of lilith protests against  the pitiless storm that assails literary work known to emanate from a womans brain and is only comforted when the hero assures her that  an intellectual woman sets a barrier between herself and the beasts they lnuest detest you in selflefence most of your adverse critics are the poorlypaid hacks of the daily journals who envy you your house your horses your good fortune and your popu larity with the public such opinions show that miss corelli cannot think that she owes any of her own popularity to the puffing of the press she so heartily despises it may be however that if miss corelli is badly treated by the poorlypaid hacks she is admired by injudicious friends who entirely against her own wishes endeavour to  quarter on the enemy so to speak by getting inserted in these very daily journals many paragraphs about the interest the royal famuilyof england take in her last book the advantageous terms she has made with her publishers the handsome revenue she derives from the large sale of her works and all the other varieties of the puff preliminary this seems the most tenable theory and an incident of which we have direct knowledge goes to support it some time since there arrived at the office of the novel review a manuscript entitled 1 a few notes on a celebrated novelist giving various information about miss corelli this was sent back to the name and address given as that of the writer who however seems to have been one of those who  do good by stealth and blush to find it fame for the manuscript was returned through the post as having been unclaimed at the address given its return however relieves the present writer of a difficulty he and he trusts miss corelli will forgive him the crime implied in this admission of his sex on the ground that in this matter he is the victim of circumstances over which he had no control is innocent of any knowledge of the author of  the soul of lilith other than that which can be obtained by readng some of her earlier books now in these days there is an nsatiable desire for personal details about any one who is before the publica desire which appears in its most generous manifestation as heroworship and in its meanest leads people to read the society papers and to visit the chamber of horrors that the lower forms of this desire are wholly detestable is no reason why its higher forms should not be gratified any invasion of the private life of notable persons is undesirable but men or women who seek the suffrages of the public as polticians or writers have themselves and not that public to blame when people want to know all about their political or literary development and when the demand for such informa tion is supplied by the omniscient press the novel revievw is glad to tell the novelreading public all that can fairly be told about the men and women who cater for their amusement and instruction and in the particular case in hand it is possible that our readers may like to know something about miss marie corelli it is perhaps best therefore to give here just as they were sent in by the retiring informant abovementioneda few notes on a celebrated novelist miss marie corelli the author of that extraordinary book a rmance of two worlds and the still more remarkable ardath the story of a dead self of which the spectator justly observed that it had beaten beckfords  vathek is the most unapllroachable of living novelists not from any lack of geniality but simply from her unalterable resolution not to be interviewed she occupies the almost unique position of being a pretty woman who has never beeil i photographed lbcause she dislikes the idea of her  counterfeit presentment being sold in the shops for a shilling she has gained her wide popularity without a single  boom having no advantages in the way of friends or personal connexions on the press the sales of her books are enormously on the increase aud from her royalties alone she has a handsome annual income she has a large daily batch of letters from all parts of the world and among her correspondents she counts the queen of italy lord tennyson mr gladstone theodore watts ouida rider haggard and hosts of other wellknown and distinguished people who hold her in the greatest esteem and regard there is not the slightest doubt that she is an extremely pretty and fascinating person and her sympathetic interest in and ready practical aid extended to the struggling aud unfortunate in her own and other artistic lprofessionls is a notable feature of her lovable character she is the very woman who ought to form a  salon after the old french methods for she is the most perfect hostess imaginable never at a loss always realy with some graceful word that puts the awkward at their ease and charms the most indifferent her manner is truly the essence of high courtesy when i first saw her a slight petite figure arrayed in a lovely teagown of vieuxrose velvet a diamond comb catching up the luxuriant mass of her fair hair and noted her joyous childlike smile her radiant eyes her whole aspect so unfagged so riante so altogether anliterary i had much ado to convince myself that she was really the author of the complex and wonderful  ardath t p oconnor calls her  dresden china an epithet which exactly suits her blonde tresses and dazzling complexion and that  dresden china actually wrote that terrible absinthe story  wormwood does seem a curious anomaly she is the darling of her home the idol of her friends and the wags of publishinghouses call her bentleys favourite which it would seem she is personally as well as from a businesspoint of view it is rurnoured that she is to be  sent for to windsor the queen being much fascinated by the originality and poetic beauty of her writings one would be curious to know what her majesty will think of the bewitching little woman herself who has been capable of holding her own in an argument with m1r gladstone andl even causing that  grand old m1an to resign on one occasion a discussion in the house where he was expected for the sake of an afternoon in her company in her own home she receives lords dukes and commoners with equal ease and grace in fact no one is more a favourite with the  upper ten than the pretty marie whose social charm consists in complete unselfish ness and rare tact she can never be persuaded to talk of her self or her works but she will talk of others with enthusiasm and generosity her praise is delicious because so ungrudging add to all this that she is one of the wealthiest amonom the members of the literary profession and can command higher terms for her books than anyone at present to the front that she never works unless it pleases her and even then takes her own time about it and certainly never grinds at anything and we shall have obtained a glimpse as  through a glass darkly at one of the most eminent charming and brilliant women of the time onlooker we have nothing to add to the above account for the accuracy of which we of course cannot vouch and proceed to a consideration of the novel itself in an introduetorv note the author disclaims the tite of novel for her work it is she says  simuply the account of a strange and daring experiment once actually attempted and is offered to those who are interested in the unseen  possibilities of the hereafter merely for what it isa single episode in the life of a inan who voluntarily sacrificed his whole worldly career in a supreme effort to prove the apparently unprovable the hero of this experiment is named elraami a gentleman with a skin dark as a mulattos a black moustache and perfectly white hair but more remarkable still for a pair of eyes which enable him to exercise extraordinary powers he is introduced to us at a performance of  hamlet where he looks full at an american heiress who has been much struck by his appearance  with an instinctive movement she recoiled and her own eyes fell never in all her giddy thoughtless little life had she seen such fiery nightblack brilliant orbs merciful as he is strong el ranii removes his  piercing gaze and informs one sir frederick vaughan a fair dissipatedlooking young fellow who speaks to him that tiie girls name is idina chester that vaughan will be intro uced to

dozens of soliloquies in which he indulges as merely a calculation founded on his knowledge of the persons concerned elranmi knows that vaughan is in debt and open to any offer front an heiress that his cousin lord nelthorpe is tired of paying his debts and determined to marry hilm off to miss chester and that  the little chester girl has her heart set on an english title even though it be only that of a baronet the reader is thus led to hope that elrimni is no ordinary thoughtreading quack but is merely gifted with a purely natural but highlycultivated faculty for putting two and two

the incredulous elrfimi  gods deathless messenger and  the straight pure brilliancy and limpid lustre of those unearthly orbs sent shudders through elratui who becomes very ill indeed after this experience the monk is in fact one too many for our hero he displays the most provoking composure when elrami shows him some information which the soul of lilith has brought from  the golden spaces of the stars concerning  the inhabitants of sirius their laws customs and progress and 1 the world of neptune how it is composed of one thousand distinct nations united under one reigning eumperor known at the present era as ustalvian the tenth the monk disappears mysteriously leaving a written message 1 with liliths love comes liliths freedom unfortunately lilith takes to saluting elrami as  my beloved on the return of her soul to her body and this causes ian icy thrill to run through his veins hence comes great delight to her nurse zaroba who has already tried to persuade feraz to make love to the sleeping lilith by saying  with the air of an inspired sorceress delivering a prophecy i feraz you have manhoodprove it feraz you have missed the one joy of lifelove win it but feraz is too much under the influence of his elder brothers supernatural powers to take her advice and zaroba watches elramis scientific interest giving place to human passion with unholy glee this unpleasant old

wvashed by the salt sea but never warmed by the sun in the lays of old in the nights when astaroth was lueen of the silver hours   the magic tf all nature the music of the woods andl waters the fire of the stars the odours of the flowersall these were in the lance and beat ot the young blood autl in the touch of the soft red lips as they met and clung together in kisses sweeter than hones in wine

shook the wrinkling and sunken breast the soul becomes materialised in  soft curves and glimmers of vapoury white flushed with rose and two  starlike eyes fullorbed and splendid with a radiant blue as of heavens own forgetmenots but elritlui cannot bear the splendour of this vision he recalls the soul to the body  ascends to a heaven of blind delirious ecstasy and after devouring her loveliness with his eyes curve by curve line by line he pressed upon her his a long burning passionate kiss but lilith cannot bear that and after  a shuddering recoil of muscular agony     crumbles swiftly away into hideous disfigurement andl ashes in spite of hypodermic injections thereupon elrami goes mad a misfortune which does not prevent his soliloquising with as much or as little coherence as before he is taken to famagousta on receipt of a telegram from the head of the order by feraz who becomes brother sebastian and when presented with a rosebud fatuously remarks it is a rose from heaven it is the soul of lilith the above includes the story contained in this book and no one who will be at the pains to read miss corellis three volumes will deny that it gives a fair summary of them space fails us to relate all that elrami did with his  curiouslycarved crystal phials  globules of a glittering green colour and the rest of his apparatus how the old woman zaroba strays into trafalgar square fancies she is in the desert and dies on the embank ment at the foot of cleopatras needle how elrami exclaims in a semilucid interval  lilith is not here not here nor there     she is everywhere and becomes livid or to give the sketch of the experiences of ftraz in a london drawingroom and a london studio nor can we comment on the experiments of one kremlin whom elrami doctors with his electroflamma or vital elixir in order that he may continue to investigate the effects of inooushine and starshine on a magic disc but we have given the substance of the story in the authors own words the reader can now appraise for himself the real value of the book and will probably with us regret the waste of miss corellis unmistakable powers on this kind of thing the success of the book can only be accounted for by the fact that many subscribers to the circulating libraries are possessed of the taste and intelligence of the servant girls who form the clientele of fortunetellers and our latterday witches the plentiful peppering of diluted blasphemy does not prevent the soul of lilith from being trash and trash of the dullest description philip herne,englishfiction
  the english novel in the time of shakespeare tty j j jusserand translated from the french by elizabeth lee fisher unwin m jusseraxds little monograph on the english novel originally published in french some five years ago showed how much he could teach us about our own literature his researches are now presented to us in a revised and enlarged shape and the result is a contribution of permanent value to the history of elizabethan literature m jusserand has chosen ground that we ourselves have neglected but his explorations have not been superficial and we are inclined to think that future travellers in the same country will find little new information to supply and few erroneous impressions to correct with thoroughness as an investigator m jusserand combines a faculty of placing his results attractively before his readers and he has been fortunate in securing the assistance of miss elizabeth lee who has done her work of translation satisfactorily throughout miss lees english is always accurate and when it suggests a french idiom we appreciate the scholarly flavour of the rendering the book abounds in pertinent illustrations william rogerss faithful engraving of queen elizabeths portrait forms the frontispiece a view of burghley house exemplifies the richness of elizabethan architecture with which contemporary literature had much in common portraits of sir philip sidney and his sister wellselected plates from such works of imagination as topsoils  fourfooted beastes and  serpents examples of the illustrations employed in french seventeenth century romances all give a charm to the volume which the scholar will appreciate no less than the general reader the useful index deserves a word of praise m jusserand traces the sources of the novel even before the remote date of beowulf but he wisely avoids merely archaeological speculation and begins a detailed treatment of his subject with sir thomas malorys  morte darthur as everybody is aware caxton was the printer of this noble and joyous book but it is less generally known that this was only one of caxtons efforts as printer editor or translator to gratify his patrons insatiable taste for works of fiction the new forms of literature and the new lines of thought which the renaissance introduced seemed to stimulate rather than to check the demand for chivalric romances which had grown steadily through the middle ages as we watch in m jusserands pages the development of the novel from caxtons translations through lord bernerss unwieldy romances to the works of fiction produced by shakespeares contemporaries lyly and greene we are deeply impressed by the permanence of mediaeval influences the early elizabethan writers of romances assimilated much renaissance sentiment but it is not until wo reach nashs studies in real life at the close of the sixteenth century that the medico val leaven is superseded lyly with his wealth of illustration drawn from the scientific speculations of the middle ages and his fanciful descriptions of athens or naples and greene with his stories of knights and kings and courts of chivalry look like lineal descendants of the jongleurs of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they reflect the past and despite m jusserands ingenious and luminous suggestions to the contrary only occasionally foreshadow the future but m jusserand has invested his accounts of lylys work and of that of lylys successors with so much fresh and appreciative comment that it will be impossible hereafter to refuse to these survivals a literary any less than an historical interest lylys hero euphues becomes an attractive figure in the skilful hands of m jusserand but euphuess undoubted affinity at some points to richardsons heroes does not convince us quite so readily as m jusserand is convinced that he is in any literal sense  the ancestor in direct line of grandison  or of lord orville the theory at any rate needs further testing of sidney and pastoral romance of thomas nash and the picaresque novel and of english fiction in the seventeenth century m jusserand treats with far more judgement and knowledge than any of our own countrymen have devoted to the subjects m jusserand is able at times to render his criticism and information more effective by drawing upon his knowledge of french literature for illustrative comments sir thomas malorys sole mention of himself or of his personal opinions throughout his monumental epic is in a short chapter in which he laments the decay in his day of virtuous love m jusserand well contrasts the cold seriousness characteristic of the english romancewriter with the impetuous warmth of the author of aucassin and nicolette the relations between early english and french literature have never been fully investigated and the fact that french translations of greenes romances and of sidneys  arcadia became while elizabeth was still queen almost as popular in paris as the originals were in london will be news for many wellinformed students of our literary history some of them may not be more familiar with the circumstance that the debts which french readers of romance contracted to english authors in the sixteenth century were amply repaid in the seventeenth century when english lovers of fiction satiated themselves with the interminable romances of scud cry or la calprenede in english versions these international amenities which have been much neglected by literary historians are worth dwelling on and in the elaborate history of english literature on which it is generally understood m jusserand has long been engaged we may fairly anticipate to find them fully discussed the points of interest about this book are so numerous than it would be impossible to deal with them in detail here but those who read for amusement only may be as safely recommended to procure it as the smaller class who seek to extend their knowledge of the elizabethan epoch which remains the most brilliant of our literature,englishfiction

the sacred fount new novels by henry james methuen  co mk james narrates this story in the first person so that the experiences and reflections of the narrator appear as if they were mr jamess own in order to keep up the dramatic illusion we shall preserve mr jamess own name in describing the narrator though it must not be imagined that we regard his use of the first person singular as anything but a dramatic fiction  mr james then one summer day found himself at a london terminus on the way to a country house party which we are to believe was one of the smartest for example not only do the husbands pair off as a matter of course with other peoples wives but they do not even take the same trains as their lawful partners moreover the food and the pictures and other luxuries of a decadent civilization are all to be found of the very best at this smartly unconventional establishment poor  mr james the dramatic character evidently not being wholly at home in such a smart set is naturally somewhat impressed and rather shy at the prospect before him but he very sensibly determines to make the most of a unique occasion by going about with a mental not ebook and an inquiring disposition  and he does not lose an instant j in beginning for at the station he sees a mr long whom he had once or twice before met at the same house but who had always hitherto consistently cut him at other places this gentleman he had consequently put down as a fool but on this occasion long recognises him with some warmth and the change is so remarkable and surprising to  mr james that he immediately assumes that long has become quite intelligent and devotes his inquiring mind through the rest of the book to trying to find out how such a change has come about he has not arrived at the end of his train journey before he has elaborated a theory in collaboration with a mrs brissenden who of course is travelling down without her husband and who in the wellknown way of smart poople habitually calls this husband  poor briss the theory shadowy as it is seems to be the chief point of these pages so we shall leave anybody who is sufficiently interested to find it out for himself to find confirmation for it 44mr james has a merry time of it with all the other characters of the book he goes about button  holing all the men generally opening with my dear man to show his intimate knowledge of polite society and even the ladies of the party have an occasional my dear woman tossed to them he does not impart to any of them his theoryhe is far too subtle for thatbut he tries to lead them by the most terribly long  winded conversations into admissions of a position of which they are supremely unconscious to do them justice most of his interlocutors are supremely bored by liim and have very little scruple in telling him so  you cant be a providence and not be a bore says one of the good women plainly enough to him but if his interlocutors are bored what must his readers be  for not content with writing out all these subtly incoherent conversations at length he sometimes interrupts them for four or five pages on end to explain the portentous signification which his imagination sees in a droop of the lips or a movement of the hand the book ends up with a conversation of about one hundred pages with mrs brissenden it takes place in the drawingroom after twelve when most of the ladies have gone to bed and the servants have been squared another subtle and characteristic touch of smart society to leave the lights on as a result of this terribly improper conference in the full blaze of the electric light it appears that not only is mr jamess  theory incorrect anyhow but that it is absolutely gratuitous as the fact which it should have explained is not a fact for long turns out to be as great an ass as ever the whole book is an example of hypochondriacal subtlety run mad the characters in the book are simple stupid english people direct and comparatively uninteresting and  mr james becomes simply a bore besides being vulgar in his absurd attempt to read into them subtle conditions of soul of which they are totally incapable  fiction the sacred fount by henry james heinemann 6s had anyone but mr james written this book his admirers might well have cried  oh tis sacrilege but since mr james himself is the author what can we say but that he has in his own brilliantly tedious way with his own inimitable art and with his own occult knowledge of what the lifting of an eyebrow or the movement of a back may meansucceeded triumphantly in an elaborate satire on himselfthat is on his own obsession  everybody knows what mr jamess obsession is and after achieving the last page of this volume it is evident to us that mr james also knows with him as with the character without a name who tells the story the vision of life is an obsession to him for real excitement  there are no such adventures as the intellectual ones  in every word or action of his fellowcreatures he perceives motives that like the lines on a railway siding have no beginning and no end mr james has never carried his analysis of the daintily unimportant further than in the sacred fount and never before to our knowledge has he after incredible labour with bricks of gossamer and mortar of sunbeams blown down the dainty edifice with such a goodhumoured series of puffs the last page brings a vision of mr henry james stepping forward and saying with a profound obeisance   you perceive how prodigiously i know myself the sacred fount we may say without more ado is youth the theme of the book is the hypothesis that youth has the power to rejuvenate and vivify age but at the cost of the oozing away of the sap of youth from itself but mr james is not a believer in his own theory or only to a certain extent he turns tail he allows his speculations to be derided and the end is more smoke than fire or perhaps it would be fairer to say that he uses his hypothesis merely as a means of showing to what prodigious lengths the analytical mind can go it is as if the princess in the fairy tale from the suggestion of the presence of the pea beneath her mattress had created a market garden of flowering shrubs the pea represents the cell from which mr james as master nurseryman has produced his garden of exotics a day and an evening cover the period of the story which passes at newmarch a country house of liberal ease and delightful appurtenances there a few choice guests are gathered among them is the narrator with his passion for embroidering on things and his genius for seeing a hundred complex reasons behind a cursory remark or a chance movement the way you get hold of things says mrs brissenden sometimes she is called mrs briss  is positively uncanny it is here is an example of just how much the nameless narrator we must restrain ourselves from the temptation of identifying him with mr james sees in a glance something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to hi in at the house he had met his wife she had in 8 me way dealt with him he had beeu with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him we have not space to quote the many things this rontgenrayeyed guest saw in mrs brissendens back but we can assure the reader that a page of the book does not cover them his awakening is due to mrs brissenden she patiently refuses to play the part of a pretty fly refuses to walk into the parlour to put a pretty copingstone to his palace of gossamer instead she fires her bright artillery at him and the concussion shakes down the palace of gossamer he has been elaborating his theories at infinite length and her comments are   how can i tell please what you consider youre talking about    you see too much    you talk too much    you overestimate the penetration of others     youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build upyou build up houses of cards are we extravagant in suggesting that this is mr henry james in a grimly humorous mood turning his analytical mind on himself the skill of the story is enormous  the triumph of its artistic presentment is indisputable only mr james could have written it so much we grant willingly but since an authors power of being able to interest his reader in his story as story must depend on the temperament and predilection of the reader we will give our personal verdict by slightly modifying one of mr jamess own locutions the narrator in the pause that follows some remarks he has made to mrs brissenden thus soliloquises oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it we would saythe transposition is slight oh how intensely we didnt like having to read our way to the very end of the sacred fount if mr james hadnt so handsomely put into it all his delicate talent and thus illumined the tediousness of the story we should not only have made a wry face but yawned ourselves away to the company ofwell of john silver or captain kettle,englishfiction

the whirlwind fiction by eden phillpotts chapman  hall 6s mr phillpotts is at his best in this his latest novel which made its first appearance in the pages of the fortnightly review his standard is a high one his method is conceived on a large scale it is no other than to bring all the aspects of naturethe changing sky with its range of colours the wind that blows across his devon moors the trees the flowers the animals all the denizens of earthinto league with him in telling one great story of passion or love or disaster his human characters emerge from this great background  first you see the village of lydford nestling quietly in a nook of the wide moorthen the farmhouse ruddyford and the old peat mine the place in which his chief characters live and gradually the chief characters themselves stand out from their fellow villagers and over them something of the eternal greatness of things is thrown something which comes from the greatness of their setting in the carrying out of this conception he brings great skill to bear but the result is not on the level of the intention if it were so mr phillpottss work would take a high place in english literature a place above that of thomas hardy there is something lacking there is an element of disappointment for though his descriptions of natural scenery and events are vivid and at times beautiful though his grip on his characters never relaxes and their doings are always interesting yet the two are never moulded into shape by a view of things the scope of which is sufficiently wide to present one allembracing outlook each remains separate there is no dominant idea which would create the requisite unity in design this defect is noticeable in  the whirlwind though the story is one which never fails to hold the attention and to hold it strongly in isolated detailfor example in the character of hilary woodrow a remarkably subtle study or in the character of sarah jane a magnificent woman or in many descriptions of moorland scenery and of superb happenings in the heavensmr phillpotts has done nothing better but there is a lack of inevitability about the final tragedy and that lack lends to the tragedy an element of sordidness which is belittling great art takes facts which may be in themselves brutal and by its magic touch raises them above themselves by showing that which lies beyond every fact and the beauty which is a part of all suffering this transforming touch is absent from  the whirlwind as it is absent from all mr phillpottss work and its absence prevents his work rising to the high place which the excellence of his actual writing his knowledge of humanity his love of nature would otherwise command  the whirlwind by eden phillpotts  chapman  hall mr phillpotts has come to be recognised as a writer with a sense of the underlying tragedy of life his irony is in a manner sophoclean and he is fond of dealing in primary emotions and with simple psychological problems in this way he undoubtedly gets near the earth  that  good red earth  he loves on dartmoor at one time moving strongly under the influence of mr hardy he had a derivative air  but that has faded and he is now himself and indeed pursues his own course with individuality he has chosen to abide by dartmoor and by dartmoor he stands or falls he brings to it an indeterminable love and a corresponding sympathy the very humours of the moor one feels affect his moods as they affect some of his characters his tales now take the impress of the moor with its gloom its starkness and its dignity this one is the tragedy of a peasant couple daniel brendon and sarah jane friend sarah is the daughter of the moors as brendon is a aeon of them her father is the caretaker of abandoned peatworks in a desolate place and these have eaten their way into his spirit he lives and talks in peat from his solitary cottage arises the tall fair saxon fullbosomed woman with a frankness beyond ordinary and a compelling beauty the giant brendon with his slowmoving wits is attracted by her and so are others but her choice is brendon a godfearing jealous farmlabourer with a strange unwholesome and neurotic master this latter woodrow who is rather unconvincingly represented as something of a misogynist succumbs to the wife of his servant and persistently woos her it is never made clear to us why or how he wins her if it was because she thought to advance her husbands interests then it was not like sarah jane nor is the supposition consistent with her subsequent attitude to woodrow we are forced back upon the suggestion that she was in love with two men at the same time to which we demurin the womans case at any rate however it is obvious by this time that mr phillpotts is marching fast on tragedy and owing to the meanness of an old admirer sarahs tragedy deveiopes quickly the slow fires of the passive brendon awake and break into flame in the end we leave him in the salvation army uniform though the date of the story is fifty years back it mill be seen that while mr phillpotts runs the risk as often of falling into melodrama he keeps himself out of that pit by the artistry of his handling and the dignity of his characterization in playing with heroic issues he never descends to bathos and the conclusion satisfies poetic justice if it wrings the tender heart,englishfiction

finsbury square  a relative ol the sea adventurers and their friend in after life  on the evening of the same day on which the child and the two negroes had lieen saved from the wreck by the fortunate appearance of the frigate mr witherington of finsbury square was sitting alone in his diningroom wondering what could have become of the circassian and why he had not received intelligence of her arrival mr witherington as we said before was alone lie had his port and his sherry before him and although the weather was rather warm there was a small lire in the grate because as mr witherington asserted it looked comfortable mr witherington having watched the ceiling of the room for some time although there was certainly nothing new to be discovered filled another glass of wine and then proceeded to make himself more comfortable by unbuttoning three more buttons of his waistcoat pushing his wig farther hack ofthis bead and casting loose all the buttons tit the knees of his breeches he completed his arrangements by dragging towards him two chairs within his reach putting his legs upon one while he rested his arm upon the other and why was not mr witherington to make himself comfortable he had good health a good conscience and eight thousand iyear     as mr witherington senior had always studied comfort his son had early imbibed the same idea and carried his feelings in that respect to a much greater excess he divided things into comfortable and uncomfortable one line day lady mary witherington alter paying all the household bills paid the debt of nature that is she died her husband paid the undertakers bill so it is to be presumed that she was buried mr witherington senior shortly uftnvarls had a stroke of apoplexy which knocked him down death who has no feelings of honour struck him when down and mr witherington after having laid a few days in bed was by a second stroke laid in the same vault as lady mary witherington  and mr witherington junior our mr witherington after deducting 40100 for his sisters fortune found himself in possession of a clear 1000 per annum and tm excellent house in finsbury square mr witherington considered this a comfortable income and he therefore retired altogether from business during the lifetime of lus parents he had been witness to one or two matrimonial scenes which had induced him to put down matrimony as one ol the things not comfortable therefore lie remained a bachelor his sister moggy also remained unmarried  but whether it were from a very unprepossessing squint which deterred suitors or from the same dislike to matrimony as her brother had imbibed it is not in our power to say mr witherington was three years younger than his sister and although he had for some time worn a wig it was only because he considered it more comfortable mr witheringtons whole character might lie summed np in two wordseccentricity and benevolence eccentric he certainly was as most bachelors usually are man is but a rough pebble without the attrition received from contact willi the gentler sex  it is wonderful how the ladies pumice a man down into a smoothness which occasions him to roll over and over with the rest of his species jostling but not wounding his neighbours as the waves of circumstance bring bim into collision with them these are all the specimens we shall give of captain marryatexcept one of his neat reflections  poor men unfortunately always make love better than those who tyre rich because having less to care about and not being pulled up with their own consequence they are not so selfish and think minti more of the lady than of themselves voting ladies also who fall in love never consider whether there is snflicient to make the pot boilprobably because young ladies in love lose their appetites and not feeling inclined to eat at that time they imagine that love will always supply the want of food we have intimated that we will not follow the track ofthe story from the laughing middy to the captain promoted for his brave subversion of the cruel pirates whose commander aili is a byronlike and powerfully drawn character neither shall we touch upon the sketch of  the

mrs hallibwiorfs troubles by mr henry wood 3 vols bentley mrs henry avood has lost no time in producing a third novel it is not likely that writing at this extravagant rate she can keep up her reputation to the standard expected from the author of east lynne and we are not surprised to find  mrs halliburtons troubles little better than a repetition of the channings the plot is to all intents and purfloses the same we have the two large fannies  one poor industrious and despised the other proud worthless and fraudulent the halliburtons being the good family end in success and prosperity the dares on the other hand come to ruin and disgrace to suppose that this must always be the case is a mistake the spectacle of vice overthrown and virtue triumphant is we fear moro often to be met with in novels than in everyday life in this wicked world of ours the subject has become hackneyed and scarcely serves to create any powerful interest in a mere fictitious story it has been truly said that two gifts are required in order to write a good book  to know what to say and what to withhold no one knows what to say better than mrs wood in the latter gift she seems to be a little deficient the many chapters on glovemakers would have been better withheld  the domestic quarrels and drunken brawls of honey fair are true enough no doubt we all know of similar neighbourhoods in every large town we read of such scenes every day in thc papers in a tract or even in a work on political economysuch subjects might be fitly handled and turned to good account in a novel they are wearisome and out of place breaking the thread of the story and having very little connexion with the plot the scene of mrs halliburtons troubles is laid at helstonleigh the same old cathedral town in which the channings resided mrs halliburton in the first half of the book goes down hill in every chapter she loses her parents and her husband and her little girl affording scope for three deathbed scenes in the first volume and a half she finds herself without means of support friendless and alone in the city of helstonleigh  and being unable to pay her rent an execution is put into the house this brings her misery to a climax the dares begin by defrauding the halliburtons of their half of the fortune left by a mutual uncle they afterwards oppress and persecute them in many ways the boys all go to the college school and the dares cut the halliburtons call them snobs and attack them in the streets whenever they can get an opportunity william halliburton and cyril dare are fellowapprentices at a great glovemanufactory and of course the contrast in their conduct is always strongly marked we have the same old incident of a missing cheque and the dares try hard to prove that young halliburton has stolen it but finding that cyril dare is himself the culprit the matter is instantly hushed up by this time the halliburton star has begun to dawn on them jane obtains employment as a glovemaker from her landlord mr ashley who takes also great interest in her sons the young halliburtons are so superior in manners and education to the other college boys that their mother is requested to take pupils of an eveningand when her lodger a rich and kindhearted old lady dies the widow takes in boarders and keeps a kind of  dames house in connexion with the college the older they grow the more the young halliburtons rise in the world and the dares fall in proportion idle worthless and extravagant they get into every kind of scrape they owe money and they endorse bills they gamble and drink and quarrel and cheat andi lie anthony hos an intrigue with one of the gloveresses in honey fair and herbert flirts with his sister s italian governess and with a pretty little quaker girl who lives next door to mrs halliburton the italian is jealous and revengeful the quakeress confiding and simple and so far this part of the story is interesting and well managed william halliburton advises his pretty neighbour to have nothing to say to herbert dare and threatens to tell her father the glovers foreman of her evening walks with her worthless admirer henry ashley the mastermanufacturers only son a cripple from his birth also confides to williamhislove for anna lynn the little quakeress and as henry is allowed to indulge every whim that seizes him he is never happy without william halliburton who spends much of his spare time with his excitable but afflicted friend and becomes secretly attached to mary ashley his masters daughter william in time rises to be a junior partner in the business thereby cutting out cyril dare who aspires to this post as well as to the hand of mary ashley next after a violent dispute with his brother herbert anthony dare is found one night murdered and herbert is committed for trial on suspicion and awaits the assizes in helstonleigh jail he would have been pronounced guilty had not the timid modestlooking little quakeress stepped forward and proved an alibi just at the critical moment he could not have murdered his brother at their own home for he was passing the evening with her in the field at the back of her fathers house so herbert is acquitted but anna lynn loses her good name and her father has a stroke of paralysis and herbert finds helstonleigh unpleasantand obtains a situation abroad where he is followed by the italian governess who is in fact the murderess having intended to give the false herbert merely a gentle stab on his return from his visit to anna lynns she in the dark attacks anthony by mistake and as he happened to come in drunk and incapable he fell on the dagger and was killed on the spot very little regretted by helstonleigh in general the one redeeming point in herberts character is his honourable conduct towards anna lynn rather than cast a shadow of scandal on her good name he steadily refuses to tell any human being where he was on the evening of the murder and this is the only good trait evinced by any one member of the dare family the expose of pretty annas conduct causes henry ashley an agony of grief and a violent illness ensues from which he returns to his ordinary life a sadder and a wiser man and he helps william in his schemes for the improvement of honey fair which is chiefly brought about by collecting the men together after working hours and giving them a comfortable room to sit in good books to read pleasant little lectures and above all friendly sympathy without which latter ingredient no movement for the reformation of hon 3y fairs will ever be of the slightest avail the last chapter brings the halliburtons to the height of prosperity and the dares to the lowest degree of humiliation the dares wish they were all dead and mr ashley helps them oft to australia and the halliburtons have a grand triumphant finale mr ashley is high sheriff for the county and entertains in great state  her majestys justices of assize  his daughter now mrs william halliburton being unconsciously admired by mr justice keene mrs halliburton looking quiet and ladylike in a grey silk gown sits on a sofa and flirts with the bishop the great merit of the book is the true and simple manner in which every scene and character are depicted they may be all living human beings for aught we know to the contrary the bad are perhaps a little too bad they are seen always on the worst side and the good again are drawn like queen elizabeth with no shadows at all but still they are real and we know them and believe in them and take an interest in them and though the story is long and not always lively we are compelled to read on to the end and to see the last of the halliburtons the moral and religious principles inculcated are unexceptionable,englishfiction

ficti ion sons of the morning by eden phillpotts methuen 6s we have ere now frankly expressed our conviction that mr phillpotts is a writer of exceptional gifts we have also noted his tendenoy towards mere excitation sons of the morning is a novel which bears out both our encomium and our disparagement it is finely written it has some of the qualities of a stately nature poem but its function is  mere excitation at first the book seems to offer an interesting problem in human affairs honour endicott loves two men of contrasting temperaments at the same time and in the same way we are accustomed to the situation when the person whose affections are divided is a man but a woman of this sort of versatility is a little uncommon and in devonian scenery with pious rustics babbling around her more than a little piquant one asks whether the heroines dual passion will make her a genius or a mad woman a social iconoclast or a saint but mr phillpotts simply cuts the gordian knot shaking nrieti s revive at the stroke of death but the reader ps we have here touched the salient spot of improbability as well of futility in a volume that is by no means deficient in that ingredient there are in it things far more extraordinary than the death of a husband by a fall but it may be said with perfect truth that to sustain conviction in a story it is necessary that all catastrophes of fundamental importance should seem as well as be inevitable great writers successfully compel the illusion that they are mouthpieces of reality mr phillpotts is self betrayed as the mouthpiece of mr phillpotts it is so in the conclusion of lying prophets it is so in sons of the morning and yet his cunning is indisputable he can write lyric prose and make his beautiful devon live in a manner that causes one to feel that whatever their misfortunes his two lovers were veritable  sons of the morning it has been said that merely to insert marry come up is a step towards creating the illusion of an historical romance so too does a word like toadflax help to create the illusion of a country romance mr phillpotts has planted his characters on real soil the sense of growth and space is over his story and he can use rightly the names of many wild things besides toadflax strong is he too on the side of local colour his witch is a fine invention though the machinery of the story would creak less if he had never reverted to oil of man his rustics who revolve about honour as mr hardys did about bathsheba a greater creation are always amusing this is the way in which churdles administers consolation to the father of a stillborn babe  beggin your pardon theers a gert lesson to such a trouble if a body cant be tu stiffnecked to see it it do teach us worms o the airth as even god amighty have got a pinch of something human in the nature of unas ive allus said for that matter this here shows how even he can alter his purpose arter a thing be well begun an bant shamed to change his everlasting mind now an again moren the wisest of us theers gert comfort in that if you please if mr phillpotts will strive towards organic perfection perfection of form and mechanismhe may do

capital photographic view of seor hill circle and watern torquietly gives the reader his first sense of the background and atmosphere of the ttory from this we turn by chance to page 457  far below them in fulvous light of a wild sunset the circle of seor hill appeared concerning the memories its granite girded christopher knew little but at sight of waterns crest now dark against the flaming sky he remembered that there lay the scene of stapletons end and regretted that he had come within sight of it that night to him the distant mountain was a theatre of tragedy to honor an altar of saorifioe the hero and heroine are each the last of a line the final fruit of an ancient stock methuen 6s  sons of the morning by eden philpotts 6s methuen mr philpotts is in danger of taking himself and his work too seriously this tendency only too marked in 1 children of the mist is still plainer in  sons of the morning we confess to having found much of mr philpotts new novel sadly wanting in attraction and brightness it contains not a little excellent writing nothing could be more humorous than the rustic scenes while the descriptive work is good though there is too much of it but failure is in the central figures they are stiff and unreal not convincing enough to win our sympathy besides to make matters worse the story never ends it simply breaks off leaving the heroine in blank despair true she deserved her fate but that is small consolation for the reader a woman of a type happily abnormal she was violently in love with two men at the same time hence of course complications follow which we do not propose to reveal if the reader chooses to unravel them he will be rewarded by some diverting studies of devonshire yokels in which mr philpotts returns to his old saner merrier self the problem novel may not yet have had its day but the problem novel without a real problem certainly has  sons of the morning by eden phillpotts methuen  co ix spite of certain attempts at preciosity and a too obvious searching after strenuous words this author has a vivid style and a powerful grasp alike of human nature and the moods and phases of what in comparison we class as inanimate it is a pity there should be this tendency to mannerism that words like dislimn and  hypeethral should appear in contrast to such grovelling modernisms as  a wage because without them the descriptive passages would run the smoother and no discord would interfere with our enjoyment of such wordpictures as those of seor circle and watern tor the moods and phases of dartmoor have seldom been better described and the scenic setting is ever appropriate to the action of the drama which is played by the dwellers in and around bear farm honour endicott the last of her ancient yeoman race is an orphan maiden who rules her labourersa reasonably rustic and humorous set of originalsand orders her acres with sympathy and intelligence when there comes upon her as the result of neighbourhood from childish days the love of a sentimental and affectionate young squire who is not gifted with strength of character though she sees his weaknesses honour genuinely returns his attachment and all goes well till the arrival of myles stapledon her cousin to stay at the farm to which he is to contribute the assistance of his capital and skill myles is a com plete contrast to the young squire grave sensible and anxious he is a man with depths and heights of feeling unintelligible to the aesthetic but rather shallow nature which soon suspects him as a rival honour partly appreciates himso far indeed that when taxed with her lingering love for the squire who has departed in a moment of generosity to leave the coast clear she frankly says she loves both her suitors what the denoilment is

sir brook fossbrooke sir brook fossbrooke by charles lever 3 vols 8vo pp 971 24s blackwoods the wrath of achilles compelled him to resignthat of sir william lendrick constrained him to fight to the last such is the real key to this very clever novel it is perhaps the most finished of mr levers as to plot the nominal hero is one f his stock charactersa man of the world who has been everywhere seen and done everything always losing everything and always tumbling on his feet again in some extraordinary manner we cannot take much interest in him he resembles a civilised hawkeye if hewas new he would be very good but we have seen his double too often before however he fills up space uncommonly well and his adventures give opportunity for some capital descriptions and little bits of worldiyadvicejwhich come from no one better than the author of  harry lorrequer a party intrigue to get an octogenarian judge to resign would not seem a very promising basis for a novel which was to appear by instalments in a popular magazine yet few could pass a scene with baron lendrick and not wish to know whether he was ultimately triumphant over courts cabals and an unscrupulous press true there is much to be said for his enemies his incredible vanity tempted attack but the sharpness of his tongueand we not only read about bis wit bnt can enjoy itooa pat down the assailants the reality of his danger makes the contest perilous enough to interest whilst the extreme inferiority of the dogs which would beard the sick lion enlist all sympathy on one side only his generosity prevents his eating them up and though we see their footprints as they come out it is evident they have been sorely mauled varied attainments will always excite more varied if not more powerful envy and as the chief baron is alwaysin his old age at leastacute enough to appear only on his own grounds he could only be reached through the newspapers once indeed the lordlieutenant tried to see what he could do himself he fared as agamemnon would have done in the tent of achilles the host asserted every privilege and he told the story to his son who he used to say had inherited his temper but not his abilities in these words he twice rose to go away but on each occasion i had something to say that induced him to sit down again it was the whole case of ireland we reviewedthat is did i deployed the six millions before him and he took the salute yes sir education religious animosities landtenure drainage emigration secret societies the rebel priest and the intolerant parson even nationality and mendicant insolence all marched past and he took the salute   and now my lord said i  it is the man who tells you these things who has the courage to tell and the ability to display them and it is this man for whose retirement your excellency is so eager that you have actually deigned to make him a visit that he may carry away into the next world perhaps a pleasing memory of this it is this man i say whom you propose to replaceand by what my lord and by whom  will a mere lawyer will any amount of nisi prius craft or precedent give you the qualities you need on that bench or that you need sadly need at this councilboard  go back my lord and tell your colleagues of the cabinet that providence is more merciful than a premier and that the same overruling hand that has sustained me through this trial will uphold me i trust for years to serve my country and save it for some time longer from your blundering legislation that a man of such conceit as this at last falls a prey to some one who knows how to fool him to the top of his bent is a matter of course but there are many excuses for the blindness of sir william the villain of the tale is his own stepson separated from his wife and at issue with his son the old judge must fabricate for himself some kind of domestic lares his good dinners and what all who hear them for the first time admit them to be his good stories will provide him with listeners and flatterers for his evenings but he wants a majordomoa man who will make out his dinnerlist and see that his champagne is iced who can receive sir brook fossbrookes and doctor his horses in fact a primeminister whose head nevertheless is in every sense alwajs at his disposal but dudley sewell the man of forged acceptances and questionable racingbets is not to be governed altogether by even an irish chief baron and a possible peer it is a rich treat to see how he not only carves the judicial meat but rearranges the judicial wardrobe sir william is transformed into a  dandy of fifty who bows with a grace this deception does not last long but it is necessary in an artistic point of view the old man deserves a fall and even his best friends are glad to find he is not infallible meanwhile sir brook who ought to have been his most trusted friend is far away making his fourth or fifth fortune and of course spending it in daydreams before he has got it he comes back in triumph to find sir william as great as ever still demanding his peerage as the price of resignation but sobered by the recollection that he has at last given some ground for the accusation of senility at last he extorts the offerbut from the enemy he outlives the government which denies him justice and is too magnanimous to lend himself to the intrigues of their successors perhaps the incapacity of his heir may have something to do with his refusal and affection tempers pleasantly enough the last exhibition of intellectual conceit mr lever is rather too fond of letting ns know exactly what his characters like for their meals it is not that they are gluttons but we dont go to books of this class for a dietary though we might easily compile one from them the dialogue is sparkling the perpetual flavour of irishisms is not overdone and much as mr lever has written we doubt if he has ever told a less affected or a more wellwrought tale wo dont like the book the less because it appears without any grotesque illustrations like so many of the novels which are published by messrs blackwood and sons it is got up beautifully and will take a handsome place in any library long after thc first gloss is worn off by the thorough perusal its merits will ensure  sir brook fossbrookke there was a controversy some years ago between two wellknown periodicals upon the subject of lord lyttons novels one declaring its preference for his earlier the other for his later works however this may be there can be no doubt that mr levers productions are susceptible of a similar dispute for whilst they are all more or less based upon a similar plan of fiction their diction their colouring their construction have undergone from the first a gradual but marked modification this even to a careless observer was sufficiently apparent in  tony butler and in the story now before us it will be found confirmed  sir brook fossbrooke  we conceive to be one of the best of mr levers productions we cannot characterise it better than by the word clever it is essentially a clever novel moreover it exactly conforms to the true idea of the romance it supplies us with the precise entertainment that is expected to be found in fiction it is interesting and it is amusing excitement is offered without the violation of probability and it is eloquent without labour or artifice it is wholly destitute of those narratives of practical jokes and that eagerness to excite merriment which so retard the action of his earlier novels though the scene of the story is almost wholly laid in ireland the author has ver sensibly omitted all the hackneyed expletives of the conventional hibernian interlocutor there is only one  faix  in the book and what little irish there is supposed to be is so englished as to pass almost unnoticed dr lendrick a mild and amiable but nervous man the discarded son from matrimonial reasons of chief baron sir william lendrick of the court of exchequer resides with his son and daughterlucy and tomin a pleasant little spot near the river shannon thither one day attracted by the rumour of the excellent fishing to be had in the neighbourhood come sir brook fossbrooke and young trafford a subaltern in hms th casually meeting tom lendrick they are invited to his fathers house the swans nest and there he introduces them to his sister lucy the description given of sir brook fossbroope is excellent an old man who has combatted life in a multitude of shapes whose early years have been devoted to dissipation and who in his riper age yields himself up to abstract contemplations and scientific inquiries sir brook no sooner casts his eye upon lucy than he feels himself insensibly attracted towards her a resemblance to some cherished object in the past awakens in him a paternal affection and it may be said that from that moment he becomes the firm and faithful friend of the two young people nor is the impression made by lucy upon trafford less acute though with him it assumes a nature more romantic prior to his visit dr lendrick makes a journey to dublin to see his father who has been suddenly seized with a severe indispositiona fact that leads his warmhearted medical attendant dr beattie to believe a favourable moment has arrived to reconcile the father and son we are then introduced to sir william lendrick the chief barod an octogenarnan and an insufferable egotist this portrait is elaborate and apparently laboured but it is coloured with great discrimination sir william lendrick claims a larger share

nature the most acid and intractable and domestic turmoils having at last become too frequent to be longer endured this happy couple finally agree to separate nevertheless the wife occasionally honours the husband with a call and these encounters are generally marked with the profoundest courtesy on one side and the most eccentric politeness on the other the interview between the father and son results in this the old man requests him to allow lucy to live with him at his residence  the priory and further adds that he has the gift of an inspectorship of hospitals abroad which he offers to dr lendrick and which after some hesitation is accepted lucy takes up her abode with her grandfather and tom and sir brook fossbrooke both equally poor lay their heads together to devise some method of amassing a fortune the following will afford some idea of the ingenuity of their speculations the colloquy occurs between tom and his father prior to the departure of the latter from his country dr lendrick asks tom his schemes for the futurei we have got several sir the difficulty is the choice sir brook was at one time very full of buying a great tract in donegal and stock ing it with all sorts of wild animals we began with deer antelopes and chamois and last night we got to wolves bears and tigers we were to have a most commodious shootingbox and invite parties to come and sport who instead of going to bohemia the rocky mountain and to africa would find all their savagery near home and pay us splendidly for the privilege there are some difficulties in the plan it is true our beasts might not be easy to keep within bounds the jaguar might make an excursion into the marketplace the bear might eat a butcher sir brook besides doubts if ferne could be preserved under the game laws he has sent a case to brewster for his opinion dont tell me of such absurdities said lendry trying to repress his quiet laugh  i want you to speak y and seriously i assure you sir we have the whole details of this on pap even to the cost of the beasts and the pensions to the widows of the keepers that may be devoured another plan that we had and it looked plausible enough too was to take oat a patent for a wonderful medical antidote as sir brook says there is nothing like a patent medicine to make a man rich and by good l1ck he i posd of the materialfor one he has the secret for curing the bite of the rattlesnake he got it from a tusoarora indian who i believe was a sort of fatherinlaw to him three applications of this to the wound have never been known to fail  but we are not infested with rattlesnakes tom  thats true sir we thought of that and decided that we should alter the prospectus of our company and we have called it the antidote to an evil of stupendous

night and for ever muttering in her ear with white lips and trembling whisper words of cruel import yet whatever sympathy for her position her sex may compel from us we cannot help the edge being blunted by the despicable character that is disguised beneath an immaculate exterior  nor can we easily deny that all that she gets she very richly deserves however much we may detest the unmanly heart that dictates the chastisement this lady comes to the priory where she strikes up an intimacy with lucy lendrick who however does not entirely reciprocate her apparently friendly attention old sir william lendrick contemplates her with much satisfactionas much for her beauty as for the ease and gaiety of her manners subsequently the colonel ingratiates himself in the household and by much show of humility and assumption of profound respect for the judges wisdom succeeds in rendering himself endurable nevertheless the old man from certain motives fully disclosed before long significantly hints the departure of the gallant colonel and on the strength of this his mother lady lendrick rents the  swans nest  for him where in company with his wife and children he proceeds to ensconce himself he collects round him here through the medium of dinnerparties and brandy and water a number of officers whom he endeavours to swindle but to one of whom he is unfortunate enough to lose a thousand pounds this occurrence is described with great power and the unexpected presence of his wife who watches the players from the back of her husbands chair renders the whole scene singularly effective it is not our intention to enter into any further analysis of the plot believing that we have already said enough to disclose to the reader the nature of the volumes that await his perusal it is of a somewhat complex nature though uniform and consistent indeed strength is the chief characteristic of the story the interest is unflagging the incidents with which the narrative is enlivened being disposed with the nicest discrimiia ion one error however though on the right side which will be sufficiently obvious to an attentive reader we cannot pass over without comment the dialogues are almost all too brilliant from the epigrammatic point and polish with which they are contrived we miss the flow and ease of spontaneous conversation in such men as sir brook fossbrooke and the chief baron this might be thought reasonable but to make girls or men of mediocre intellect converse with the precision and point of matured elocutionists is to violate nature the dialogues in fact seem too laboured the declamation of each speaker is too sententious the conversation seems dictated by the author of  rasselas and however admirable it may be as containing specimens of a just bty le or as a record of profound observation it could have been wished for the sake of accuracy that the language of the women bad something more of sprightliness and ease and of the men something less of artificial point as a fault apart from the artistic quality of the book may be mentioned a grievous solecism in taste which we regret mr lever should have fallen into baron lendrick is a portrait so thinly disguised that every irishman will recognise it at once while a doctor in the novel is positively identified by name this is not a legitimate course for a novelist anid mr lever is

a ruthless avenger by mrs conney 3 vols hutchinson  co mrs conney has put together a capital sensational romance on somewhat oldfashioned lines  a ruthless avenger is a story of virtue and villainy of crime and the tracking of crime of jewels and elopements of a coronet usurped recovered and thrown away but the author has not been satisfied with mere sensations and improbabilities she has done her best to make things follow each other in natural sequence and on adequate motives and for the most part she has heen successful more than once or twice when the reader recognises trite incidents and wellworn machinery a fresh turn is given to the development of the story which relieves it from banality here and there no doubt mrs conney is commonplace and melodramatic and she does not make the best of all her situations still her novel is quite above the average of its kind and is thoroughly entertaining,englishfiction

ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and

had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma

she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and

these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor the religiomin seltiments wvhich the authoress puts

constance slierwood ail autobiography of th  sixteentli century new novels i by lady georgiana fut  lerton 3 vols bentley tales of religious persecution are always heroic the story of sufferings born for the sake of a creed which the sufferers believe to be the one supreme form of religious truth through which alone their prayers to the god and father of all can be offered have the power to make the heart of every generous reader burn within him for they appeal to the deepest instincts and highest sympathies of our human nature this sympathyis quite irrespective ofthe creed of the sufferers in stories all the political elements which gave rise to the strife are kept out of sight and we are shown only the innocent victims to the stern laws of the dominant party in troublous times so whether they be tales of the early christians persecuted under the roman emperors tales of christiana persecuted by other christians for points of inaccuracy in their formulas persecutions of the albigenses persecutions of the huguenot persecutions of the early reformation by the church regnant or persecutions of the roman catholics when the reformed church became dominant in england or the cruelties against the covenanters in scotland the reader can feel only sympathy with the victims martyrs give the supreme testimony to the faith for which they suffer and every feuowreatiur who reads their story feels proud of theil courage and constancy but that is because the political passions the fear and the deadly strife of tongues have all passed away and left un capable of discerning the still sad music of humanity which was ever going on in the midst of the confused noise and the garments rolled in blood we recognise in the sufferers men and brethren now that they can no more offend us by their diversities of opinion it is only on the surface of the ocean that the waters rage and swell a very little way below the surface is perfect calm lady georgiana fullerton has chosen for her theme the sufferings that religious catholics had to incur in the early days of the reformation when spanish armadas papist conspiracies and a roman catholic retender to the throne gave rise to penal aws against the roman catholics as severe and stringent as the fears of the dominant party could devise or their power enforce swarms of contemptible informers and  base betrayers of their brothers blood aroseas they have done in all times of persecution as they will ever do in her story lady georgiana introduces the record of most of the roman catholic sufferers whose names are many of them little known to the protestant general reader but which  are carefully enshrined in the memory of their  own church she also speaks of other men as  saints and martyrs who were deeply involved io the intricate politics and conspiracies of the period and who suffered for them quite as much as for their religion she paints from the roman catholic point of view and keeps entirely to the religious aspect of the struggle in her pages the catholics are oppressed men only desirous of worshipping with freedom in their own mannerwhich the laws then existing forbade under pain of death and confiscation lady georgiana fullerton always writes with grace and refinement she does not give highlywrought scenes of horror  on the contrary she is studiously selfrestrained and moderate the heroine is a fictitious personage a certain mistress constance sherwood a gentlewoman in the reign of queen elizabeth much attached to the ancient faith and connected either by consanguinity or friendship with many notable persons who suffered for their adherence to their religion most of the secondary personages are real people and the incidents narrated are for the most part quite true the references are given at the end of the third volume the story of constance sherwood is a touching picture of life under a reign of terror and penal laws there is no plot it is merely the record of the lisa of constance sherwood from year to yearof the fears temptations and difficulties under which she and her friends held fast their faith and of the testimony which many amongst them sealed with their blood the passages in the life of the countess of arundel and surrey are taken from the history of that noble house of course everything that could jar upon the readers sympathy is kept out of sight and all the catholics in the book are the most excellent of the earth the incidents of heroic generosity and selfsacrifice are told with a chastened enthusiasm which increases the readers admiration the sentiments which all the catholics express are of the purest and noblest religious virtuesuch as all christian men and women ought to feel lady georgiana fullerton has written a book  which no one can read without deep interest i g and she has written it in an admirable spirit s substituting the reformed religion for the s roman catholic it is just such a work as a  t pious

the school for fathers an old english storv by t gwynne london smith elder and co cornhill 1852 the tale is admirably told the moral excellent and thc characters are truthfully yet spiritedly drawn the events recorded are supposed to have transpired some century or so ago in the days of powder and swords and the plot is simple and may be conveyed in a few words sir thomas warren a man of pleasure and a courtier having been employed for ten years in a diplomatic capacity abroad returns unexpectedly to england and finding himself from a variety of causes incapable of pursuing the course of life in which he has been hitherto indulging determines to occupy himself in the education of his son whom he has hitherto sadly neglected now his son jack has been residing from his infancy in thc remote corner of a midland county with his uncle squire warren a fine specimen of thc foxhunter of that period in character habits and conversation he reminds us forcibly of old sir roger de coverley aud consequently presents a striking contrast to his foppish and effeminate brother living under bis roof partaking in all his amusements and pursuits jack had become the precise counterpart of his worthy relative at thc epoch when he is introduced to us he is  rising nineteen over six feet in height hale hearty and robust a keen sportsman shy and ungainly in his manners generous and warmhearted but somewhat inclined to obstinacy and in intellect not over bright at the time when his father arrives with the intention of carrying him off to london to educate him  wiore suorum jack finds himself most unpleasantly circumstanced in consequence of an attachment bc had long since formed with the fair daughter of thc vicar lydia freeman a young belle whose bright eyes have inflamed the hearts of more than one admirer fearing an angry refusal in case he should seek his fathers consent to their union he determines to brusque matters and accordingly first obtains the young ladys consent aud then informs his parent to his astonishment sir thomas offers no opposition to the match provided thc weddingday is postponed for a couple of years as he fully anticipates that long ere then an introduction to london life with all its concomitants will have eradicated this  boyish fancy poor jack arrives in london and finds himself suddenly immersed in gaieties for which he has no taste dissipations that he abhors compelled as he is at the same time to forego all his wonted pursuits and to submit to the severest discipline while he is forced te acquire accomplishments that only render him still more awkward in his demeanour and more ludicrous in his appearance sir thomas having resolved that jack should marry a lady of fortune takes much pains to effect his introduction to an eligible individual of that denomination this excites the jealousy of a host of rivals for though jack remains undeviatingly true to his  little lydia he is compelled by bis unreasonable father to make some show of  attention  to the captivating widow fairfax now it so happens that one colonel pcnruddock has already determined to win and wear her like many others of her sex under similar circumstances out of caprice the lady pretends to admire jack greatly though she has secretly predetermined to give her hand to the colonel they meet at an evening party  tins insult colonel penruddocks malignant glance was on him hatred contempt and jealousy gleamed in his eye that very morning mistress fairfax had carelessly saidon pur pose of coursethat she never beheld so fine a man as mr warrenthat be possessed so artless yet so fascinating a mode of paying his addresses she was sure no heart could resist him then she leaned her cheek on her hand looked absent sighed and allowed the colonel to address her twice before she appeared to know that he had done so at all the colonel threw himself into one of his most violent tornadoes and rushed out of the house the widow tapped ber chin approvingly with her fan surveyed her charming face in thc glass laughed hummed an opera tune and went to the auction tiie colonel had not condescended so much as to bow to her on the evening in question when he saw jack proceeding towards her the muscles of his thin face worked nervously he placed himself in the way and as jack approached leaned his hand on though back of a chair and advanced his right foot directly in jacks path jack hurrying  to qct it over perceived not the guardsmans movement isle drew near the colonel contracting every muscle held bis foot firmly planted jack tripped the colonel smiled a ghastly smile had jack been lighter or more active he would have tripped and recovered himself but the poor fellow was neither he tripped stumbled ran two or three paces forward and fell prostrate at the widows feet good manners were totally forgotten and a titter which grew to a laugh salutedjacks misfortune sir thomas swore and fumed jack arose anger and indignation chased shyness and mauvaue honte from his soul everything around bim seemed to whirl and totter he heard the laughter he felt the insult ke strode up to colonel penruddock like a young hercules and in a loud clear voice he shouted  was that on purpose or by accident  on purpose replied the colonel bowing and then drawing himself up to his utmost height  then take that 1 roared jack and doubling his fist he drew it back to his shoulder then straitening bis arm with the iron strength of a gladiator he struck the colonel on though face with the whole might of his thick muscular arm the colonel reeled and fell crushing a chair in his tall au the mun present rushed towards him the laughter was hushed penruddock arose with an oat the blood streaming from his face several ladies fell into  hysteric affections  and faintings but the gentlemen being all occupied round jack and the colonel they soon recovered their senses sir thomas drew his son away from penruddock anger and disgust stamped upon his features this unpleasant incident of course gives rise to a duel which is so admirably described that we cannot refrain from quoting it the duel there had been a slight fall of snow during the night which only partially covered the ground though shrill thin voice of thc sweep and though rolling of a few heavy dust carts were the predominating sounds the air was damp and penetrating the atmosphere murky and dull and beginning to bo charged with the smoke of early fires though shops were unopenedfew passengers abroadhere and there a workman proceeding to his work pipe

fellow your friend i my lord whispered lord langleys surgeon to him  i never saw a liner man dead or alive pity if he falls lord langley sighed and looked sorrowfully at poor jack the regimental surgeon who attended the colonel was equally struck with him egad sir what a grenadier hed make he said to captain richmond  i should ask nothing better than to command a battalion of the same sort was the reply jack and the colonel began their duel under very different feelings jack was determined not to hurt the colonel but merely to parry his thrusts he had no ill will towards him and no feeling for duels the colonel on the other hand felt that he was opposed to a rival and a man who had insulted him and put bim in a ridiculous position beneath the very eyes of his mistress his soul was bitter with hatred und revenge and he swore that cither jack or himself must die that day after a short  bout seeing jacks play he dropped the point of his sword and cried with flashing eyes and angry voice  i will not be treated like a child sir fight fairly and attack me as well as defend yourself jack obeyed and presently his bright sword entered penruddocks right breast fortunately for him the point slipped along one of the ribs instead of penetrating between them and anon though fight was renewed the swords wound about each other like lightningthc clear light clashing peculiar to the small sword only to be rightly explained by the word ucliquetis was the only sound heard jack received a wound in the thick of the arm but acquitted himself very well never lost bis coolness or temper aud gave the colonel a great deal to do still the swords clashed and glittered seconds and surgeons breathless with interest knew not on which of the combatants to pronounce at last penruddock with the expression of a demon parried one of jacks thrustsadvancedlungedthe guard of his sharp sword struck his adversarys nbs in a line with his breast the reddened blade coming out beneath the left arm pic thank the gods muttered the colonel as he drew out his sword and lord langley captain richmond and both surgeons rushed towards poor jack  i dont think its much he said putting his hand to his side  is the colonel satisfied lord langley put his arm around him jacks face grew pale his knees gave way beneath bis weight und bc sank to the earth supporting himself on his hands the surgeons tore away bis shirt the sooner to arrive at his wound they saw at once the course the sword had taken and shook their heads at lord langley  youd better not move him or disturb him my lordit will soon be over whispered the regimental surgeon lord langley kneeling down supported his dying friend and took his hand in bis poor jack feebly pressed it and witi an effort said  will you break it to my uncle and lyddie  god bless you  i will on my honour replied lord langley his eyes filled with tears there was solemn silencea silence that could be felt the surgeons knelt on each side of jack thc colonel and his friend were gone the denouement of this touching history we leave our readers to peruse from the book itself and as we cannot improve upon our authors eloquent language we subjoin the important moral he is desirous of inculcating the moral fathers before you put your sons in any particular path in life study if you can their various dispositions characters talents and capabilities how often do we see men in the army or navy who had they been allowed to follow their true bent would have made excellent churchmen or lawyers and who on their fathers death quit the profession of arms for more genial pursuits again how often do we see a languishing nonchalant clergyman without feeling for his calling perishing with ennui who would have been a distinguished soldier but for the paternal will which said  that boy must go into the church then again we behold a barrister detesting penandink and close hot courts and law study and practicea being whose aspirations and talents all pointed to the sea but his fathers taste pointed to an intellectual profession and the boy without the least love of study or much aptitude for it is dragooned bon gri mal gre to the bar you will see

robaer crusoe  as young gentlemen are wont to pronounce the name that his enthusiasm is to be gratified by being sent in quest of shipwreck and  man friday any more than that he should be allowed to be a highwayman a character for which some boys have a great penchant because his enthusiasm has been awakened by the life of robin hood or dick turpin but it is a cruel sight to see a mans life passing by in though daily avocations of a profession for which lie bas no feelingperhaps a positive dislikeand to which a fathers will condemned him even before he could walk or talki young

be we congratulate the reading public upon thc pleasure they may reasonably anticipate from the future productions of his graceful pen and lively fancy he displays not only a cultivated but an observant minda keen appreciation of humour and his descriptive powers are fully upon a par with those of any living writer we hope that the momentous lesson he seeks to impress upon the generation of  fathers  will not have been preached in vain and the volume before us will indeed be a valuable one if it prove the means of averting from a single youth the sad doom of being forced to embrace a

persons may disagree he has certainly given us such as deserved to be introduced into this country and these he has translated with much spirit in a brief advertisement the translator says when he commenced this work it was with the intention of carrying it on through many volumes and thus to have presented a complete circle of german romance but circuimstances have occurred to interrupt this project perhaps the stagnation that prevails in the book trade may have bpen the cause mr soane also notices another circumnstance and observes that a work of thig nature allows no compromise with english tastes and feelings but demands that the several tales should be selected with reference to their popularity among germans such n apology is scarcey necessary to a people that have feasted for weeks on doctor faustus and supped nightly for mionths on the sublime horrors of jder ifrieschutz the remark of the translator is however a true one the tales in these volumes are five in nuinber the first the patricians from the gerinan of c f van der velde occupies the wyhole of the first volume while the second is devoted to the master llea of c t a hoffman the third volume contains the blind passenger by f laun the adventurers by a oehlenschliiger and the mantle by b naubert these tales which present all the varieties of tihe grave and the humorous are enriched with three clever etchings by george cruilkshank the first tale the patricians relates to the feuds that prevailed ill the sixteenth century between the nobles and the citizens we shall not enter at any length on the tale which

  the traitors by e phillips oppenheim ward lock  co there is something eminently satisfactory about mr oppenheim as a novelist for he knows exactly what sort of a story he has to tell and he knows how to tell it he has at his command an abundance of fine sensational matter and as he uses it with a strict and skilful regard for the best entertainment of his readers his romances are usually effective it is hardly an exaggeration to say of  the traitors  that its interest begins on the first page and continues to the last the plot is ingenious and well managed the movement of the story is admiralty swift and smooth and the characters though by no means deep or complicated are at all events exceedingly vivacious the tale is pseudohistorical and thus obtains that glamour which hangs about great events and high personages of uncertain identity its scene of action is theos  a country which we suspect is situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of buritaniaand what with a revolution the recall of an exiled king a war with turkey and various political intrigues of a dramatic nature the readers excitement is kept on the stretch to the very end,englishfiction
tommy and grizel ra northeast new novels by j m barrie cassell  co this book is marked by the usual characteristics of the author grizel is a paragon among women her delicate apprehension mated with a masculine quality of judg ment her idealism chastened by truthfulness but tommy turns out what one fearedthe bane of this fair paragon the gift of making  believe which from his earliest years was his great endowment might either have been subordinated and utilised by dint of circumstances or running wild might overgrow the entire character mr barrie evidently with some compunction suffers the sentimental genius to dree his weird the fatal gift of pens and ink and the escape from farm drudgery are the worst misfortunes for poor tommy tommy should have enlisted physical courage any amount of presence of mind in an emergency thorough identification of himself with his part and enough imagination to know  what is going on at the other side of the hill would have been no mean qualifications for a soldier but he falls in with a slovenly silenus who earns his ale and occasional cakes by writing fluent commonplace for the publishers of serial romance for the rabble such a tutor puts tommy on a course of investigation only too congenial to him and the success of his first and famous work on woman completes his ruin he gets into a certain society in which his uncanny knowledge is attributed to his having 44 loved and lost and the tragedy of two lives is the result a feeling of disappointment which most readers will probably share is no doubt in a way tribute to the vividness of the authors portraiture but the lack of constructive power that does much to mar mr barries claim to be regarded as a novelist and not merely a clever sketcher of simple types of character is apparent in his handling of his hero once in thrums again tommy is no longer harmless though the steps of his wrongdoing show the struggles of his better nature more than once he is tempted to confide to grizel his true self but he did not know what it was in fact with all his precocity tommy never grew up and thus like many another cheerful egotist became the curse of those who loved him best there are as was to be expected inequalities of treatment in the minor personages lady pippin worth is not convincing vulgar as may oe the world of fashion and we do not believe in tommys fatal hanging on the rails he would have found a wy if only of unbuttoning his coat  notes on novels iheis notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will folio w tommy and grizel by j m barrie when mr barries story began in scribners we recorded with joy the appearance of 0 p pym  that vast and rolling figure who never knew what he was to write about until he dipped grandly but 0 p pym is only a speck on the canvas which records the rise and duplicities and fall of our old friend sentimental tommy the gentleness of his sister elspeth and the pathetic devotion of grizel the first chapter concludes   make yourself at home elspeth hes the kind i can manage was there ever a kind i couldna manage  he whispered topheavy with conceit  there was grizel said elspeth and tommy frowned wherein is a keynote to much that follows in the present work cassell 6s  tommy and grizel by j m barrie it is impossible to read mr barries sequel to sentimental tommy cassells 6s without wishing that tommy had never lived to be a man he should have been a boy for ever that however is a vain wish for mr barrie has allowed tommy to grow up and we must take him as we find him in sketching tommys career as a man of genius mr barrie has penned a satire upon the artistic temperament he does not spare tommy and lays bare with a ruthless hand the secret springs which prompt all the actions of this spoiled child of fortune in a concluding chapter mr barrie makes selections from the imaginary obituary notices which appeared in the papers at the death of mr t sandys it is a touch of a master hand and a cutting satire upon the worlds estimate of a mans character and ideals from the day tommy sets foot in london in search of work as the amanuensis of  colossal  pymn the writer of cheap popular serial fiction to the moment when he hangs throttled on the spikes of the park railings of lord rintouls estate he is incurably sentimental he clothes every act with a gauzy mist of sentiment he is tyrannised over by his sentimental impulses whose promptings he is powerless to resist his actions are performed not because he believes them good or bad but because of what he thinks other people will say of them he is always playing a part and always conscious that he is playing it he can make believe at times so superbly as almost to deceive himself and the reader he makes love as he believes the perfect lover should 1ut all the time he does not love and cannot love he is unable to resist the wiles of the tempter provided the temptation is shrouded with sentimental wrappings at times he is aghast at the situations into which his besetting weakness lands him he escapes so often that he becomes convinced at last that his little gods as he calls them will always rescue him from the consequences of his actions tommys great book upon woman brings him fame and popularity he becomes the pet of society carried away by one of his sentimental impulses he proposes to a widow whom he hardly knows to his immense relief she refuses his offer tommy flees to thrums when the hot fit is over and he realises the peril he has so narrowly escaped tommy however is only a secondary personage in the stor although mr barrie probably intended he should occupy the foreground grizel of the crooked smile the child of the painted lady grown to womanhood is the pathetic human figure around which the story revolves she is passionately devoted to the truth clearsighted and endowed with a horror of all makebelief pretence and sham it is pain to grizel if she cannot answer yes or no to a question tommy always avoids a direct answer and shirks anything that threatens to draw a dividing line between truth and falsehood grizel falls in love with tommy irresolute tommy lets her think he loves her but when the way is cleared of all obstacles to their marriage he recoils in dismay with a touching proud humility grizel refuses to bind himdo you mean you dont love me she said  you must tell me what you mean that is how others would put it he replied  i believe they would be wrong i think i love you in my own way but i thought i loved you in their way and that is the only way which counts in this world of theirs it does not seem to be my world i was given wings i think  but i am never to know that i have left the earth until i come flop upon it with an arrow through them i crawl and wriggle here and yet he laughed harshly i believe i am rather a fine fellow when i am flying   she nodded y you mean you want me to let you off she asked you must tell me what you mean and as he did not answer instantly  because i think i have some little claim upon you she said with a pleasant smile  i am as pitiful a puzzle to myself as i can be to you lhe replied  all i know is that i dont want to marry any one and yet i am sure i could die for you grizel it was quite true a burning house and grizel among the flames and he would have been the first on the ladder but there is no such luck for you tommy  you are free was what she said  dont look so tragic she alded again with the pleasant smile  it must be very distressing to you butyou will fly again 11er lips twitched tremulously  i cant fly she said there arc many tommies in the world and it is unfortunate that they have so strong an attraction for the grizels it is the grizels whose lives are spoiled and whose loving selfsacrifice is lavishly but vainly squandered upon the men who are not worthy to kiss the hem of their garments poor patient grizel is finally driven insane by tommys heartless and thoughtless behaviour tommy is fond of posing as a martyr but he is not of the stuff of which martyrs are made in remorse it is true he marries grizel and by months of devotion and care he wins her back to sanity but although he acts the part of the perfect lover he knows he does not really love and he hugs the conviction that he is a very fine fellow to sacrifice himself in this noble fashion temptation crosses his path and with hardly a struggle he falls lthe temptation is baited with a lost mis the one thing in life to which he is genuinely devoted and he promptly throws good resolutions selfrespect and everrestraining influence to the winds happily a kindly merciful providence interferes and cuts short his life once more his  little gods  save him by the desperate remedy of dispatching him from this life but from first to last it is grizel upon whom the readers eyes are fixed and it is she who wvill live when the memory of tommynv like the fame of his works has perished casseilsl 6s  tommy and grizel by a e av mason i am a man of sentiment only said tommy and there is nothing in the world we know so noble as a man of sentiment on the other hand he is apt to give his friends grounds for much uneasiness and in that aptitude tommy does not fall short of the man of sentiment in the comedy it is not to be thought however that any fuller comparison can fitly be drawn between tommy and joseph surface joseph is merely the coiner and utterer of sentiments with a view to material benefits when he postures he does so deliberately for the purposes of gain he is a plotter an intentional hypocrite with a character as black as his invariable clothes tommy however is as he confesses a man of sentiment only he would be different if he could but the creations of his fancy are the real things to him they are so real that let but a chance sentence set his imagination at work and at once he will allot to his best friend a horrible accident and a wooden leg and in order to heighten the artistic effect make that friends wife herself a friend and an old play 1 tommy and grizel by j m barrie 6s cassell mate elope with a soldier there was no unfriendliness in the invention of that storytommy whatever his faults was gentle and staunch to his friendshe even wept over it so pitiful and sad was it but he was a boy at play and could never grow up one may take another instance tommy saved a boys life at the risk of his own by plunging into a whirlpool and made a secret of his bravery the boys grandmother a brittle old lady who creaked as she walked and cracked like a whinpod in the heat discovers the preserver and having tramped the country round for ten miles to get the finest hen for a reward brings it to tommy at a moment when he is being entertained at a teaparty the old lady falls on her knees before tommy kisses his hand and pours out her thanks what was tommy doing the while he was excitedly planning the old ladys future here are his thoughts  he was a poor man but she was to be brought by him into thrums to a little cottage overgrown with roses no more hard work for those dear old hands she could sell scones perhaps she should have a cow hie would send the boy to college and make a minister of him she should yet hear her grandson preach in the church to which as a boy tommy you see was himself a boy he was always more captain stroke of the jacobites lair than t sandys esq the celebrated author he could feel aglow with the passion he had inspired but there was his limit he played so many parts he was so many characters that he had not a character of his own tommy was summarised a good many centuries ago in platos republic it will be remembered what sort of answer plato gave to the question as to the position to be allotted to the artist in his perfect state when the artist was seen coming the chief men were to put on their best clothes and go out to meet him they were to receive him with music and all imaginable honours they were to crown him with flowers and tell him what an entirely delightful person he was and then they were to conduct him through the town to the further gate and mention that there was another city a few miles down the road where he would be very comfortable and why because he played too many parts he was not a good citizen mr barries book might almost be a commentary on that the cover of mr barries first book  beiter dead reproduced by the courtesy of f a atkins esq  and vet i have a sentimental interest in better dead for it was my firstpublished when i had small hope of getting any one to accept the scotchand there was a week when i loved to carry it in my pocket and did not think it dead weight once i almost saw it find a purchaser she was a pretty girl and it lay on a bookstall and she read some pages and smiled and then retired and came back and began another chapter several times she did this and i stood in the background trembling with hope and fear at last she went away without the book but i am still of opinion that had it been just a little bit better she would have bought it from the introduction to the collected edition of the novels tales and sketches of j m barrie london hodder and stoughton passage in the republic tommy was not a good citizen and the tragedy of the story lies in the facts that he knew it that he struggled to become one and that he failed the pathos of the story lies in the fact that he was not the most margaret ogilvy mr j m barries mother she is up now and dressed in her thick maroon wrapper over her shoulders lest she should stray despite our watchfulness is a shawl not placed there by her own hands and on her head a delicious mutch  margaret ogilvy b7 her son i m bayriy hurt by the failure but that a woman was tonmny could always go back and play until in playing he met his death grizel could not play she wanted to admire tommy but she couldnt on the other hand she could love and if you wish to know what love meant to her you must read that delicate idyll  by prosen water you must learn how he hurt her and how in spite of her hurt  shamed as a dog stealing back after it had been whipped she returned to him and how tommy set himself gallantly to work to give her back her pride and selfrespect you must read how she received her first loveletter and of her terrible journey into switzerland it would be easy to expend superlatives upon mr barries delineation of grizel she is drawn with all his insight all his tenderness he suggests rather than describes her in a passage of great beauty  at the time of the doctors death she was nineteen tal and graceful and very dark and pale when the winds of the day flushed her cheek she was beautiful but it was a beauty that hid the mystery of her face the sun made her merry but she looked more noble when it had set then her pallor shone with a soft radiant light as though the mystery and sadness and serenity of the moon were in it the full beauty of grizel came out at night only like the stars  i had made up my mind that when the time came to describe grizels mere outward appearance i should refuse her that word beautiful because of her tilted nose but now that the time has come i wonder at myself   her eyes at least were beautiful they were unusually far apart and let you look straight into them and never quivered they were such clear grey searching eyes they seemed always to be searching for the truth grizel was the daughter of the painted lady and it was the memory of the time when she was a little hunted child with a great desire to grow up good and a great fear that she had that in her blood which would prevent her which made her first care for tommy tommy had been kind to her in those days moreover though she saw through the most of him what she saw most clearly was that she was the best woman to help him she could not help liking to be a mother to men she wanted them to be the most noble characters but completely dependent on her as far as tommy was concerned she would have silently stood aside but for that episode of the glove the episode is typical of their rela tions one to the other it was her glove tommy had carried it about with him wrapped up in silk paper when he plunged into the pool at the risk of his life he had said to corp his companion give her that and tell her it never left my heart he tries to hinder her from afterwards discovering the glove lest she should be hurt by the thought that she had caused him pain all this she knows and she holds the glove proof positive to her of tommys love what she did not know was how tommy came to carry about that glove it was after she had grieved him so much by telling him frankly she could not admire him that he found it and put it into his there it lay unknown to her he knew that he must not even ask them to bury it with him in his grave this was a little thing to ask but too much for him he saw his effects being examined after all that was mortal of t sandys had been consigned to earth and this pathetic little glove coming to light ah then then grizel would know by the way what would she have known i am sure i cannot tell you nor could tommy forced to face the question in this vulgar way have told you yet whatever it was it gave him some moist moments but tommy is not all a sham and he sets himself resolutely to conquering his sentiment he believes himself to have conquered and then one tragic moment reveals him unmistakably to grizel and to himself a remarkable book as  tommy and grizel  is from beginning to end the chapter in which tommys sister elspeth accepts david gemmells hand leaving tommy free to marry is perhaps the most remarkable part of it there is a moment of sheer tragedy which comes upon the reader unexpectedly and yet comes as one sees in the quite natural sequence for the novel it should be said is not a mere analysis however searching and true of certain characters it is far more than that for it is also the story which results from the cl ish of these characters tommy a window in thrums from photo by valentine and sons dundee  from the attic i could see nearly all thrumsa window in thrums and grizel are by nature antagonistic grizel can love with every pulse of blood in her veins but she cannot be the child at play tommy must play and would love if he could the woman is not faultless she can sink below the level of faultless selfrespect she can also be too masterful for her knowledge she is human nor on the other hand is tommy all faults mr barrie who writes with the good humour of a man looking broadly upon life would have us pity him he has enough manliness to make a fullgrown man were it not overbalanced by his sentiment his first feeling when he sees grizel grown into a woman is  an unselfish delight in her for her own sake when he views in her face the love which he has awakened the artist in him is entranced as if he had written an immortal page but the man is appalled he could draw back at that moment but only at her expense and so he does not one could quote many instances of a like kind and otherssuch as his patient tending of grizel during the eighteen months when her mind was cloudedwhere the manliness and the sentiment are cunningly combined into one motive but the book must be read for it is one in which the characters create the story and are themselves only fully revealed by its development and it will be read it has all the idyllic qualities of mr barries former work his humour is as fresh as when he first took the town his style as limpid but in tommy and grizel there is more you will find in the novel the tragic irony of the ancient poets and you will find it unaccompanied with any bitterness there is not merely humanity and delicacy in the portraiture of the individuals but their fortunes are treated with that breadth of view which as far as one can judge is a necessary quality of the enduring book it remains to be said that those who followed tommys boyhood will renew their acquaintanceship with his playmates corp has become a railway porter and gavinia is his wife but prosperity has not spoiled them you will see again the pathetic figure of aaron latta crouching alone over his fire and witness another encounter between mr cathro and tommie and when the book is at last laid down you will have to add another to your familiar friends in thrums for grizel of the crooked smile lived there as for tommy you may in the end be in doubt as to whether you will class yourself as a tommy or a tummy

voh smith aad bider gores lively hand is yet far from having lost its cunning it is much the best novel we have had from her of late years but the interest which holds its scenes together is somewhat of the flimsiest and there is never that welldefined purpose and but seldom the masterly detection of worldly motive which in mrs gores earlier works gave so much solidity as well as point to her sketches of society these latter however are still characteristic as of old though we have to put up with  greatestliappinessofthe gveatestnumber people and such like commonplaces instead of our old favourites the  killyourownmuttonsoil of people the drift of the book as far as we can see is to show the moralising or demoralising effects of english society and fashionable life according to the temper and disposition over which they exercise an influence but the contrast of the sisters is a little overdone the flavour is too high in the one case and in the other perhaps somewhat too low we find the happiest parts of the novel away from both old  squire pro  is a capital sketch and the progress of his clever son to eminence through all the obstructions that beset the aspiring commoner in england has more of mrs gore 8 better spirit than anything else in the book the mere writing is always pointed and clever and though few of the scenes have not been similarly dwelled upon in former novels we may not call the book tedious indeed it is a readable and interesting novel the opening chapters are particularly good and various the picture of sir george downham between the family of his first wife who despise him and his choice of a second wife whom he shall himself be entitled to despise is an excellent piege of satire and the death of the wife is a beautiful and affecting piece of writing there is also plenty of mirth to stand hi place of a better story in the amusing hits at the stokesleigbs the hartingharas lumleys and tom noddys in the quiet laughter at female pretenders from sanctimonious duchesses to mrs euphrasia primwells and in whimsical descriptions of high life from  the little crowing thing in the nursery entitled to a coronet on its papboat to the condescending great lady in the country dance  trying to look joyous aud great british while undergoing the familiarities of hands across in short there is plenty to amuse the novel reader in mrs gores diamond and pearl though less than used formerly to be found in her works to satisfy readers more difficult to amuse  the diamond and the pearl by mrs gore 3 vols colburn for a person who would be described by the majority as principally skilled in sarcastic sallies and those expositions of savoirvivre which imply keeping pace with our breathless times mrs gore possesses a store of fancy and imagination richer than ordinary an occupation more genial than the incessant keeping record of mayfair frivolities might have given her an honourable name among poetesses this we think may be gathered from her perpetual resort to trope and symbolfrom the garniture with which she can clothe some flimsy bit of worldly wisdomfrom her perpetual and we apprehend almost involuntary recurrence to the phraseology of scripture had this novel owned any other parentage its title might have led us to expect a narration of the notable murders done by a necklace or the eavesdroppings of an earring but we knew that mrs gore was about to treat us to a brilliant woman contrasted with one of tenderlydelicate nature and thus accordingly it comes to pass yet our authoress does not fulfil the promise of her title as she might have done her diamond is neither pitt nor pujotno veritable  mountain of light but a patchedup thing put together by some chemical jeweller with his blowpipe ns was the sevigne proffered by miss edgeworths lady hcarcroft to lady davenant some we suspect will object to grant it as much praise as this  or to allow that there is one scrap of  pure carbon in its composition calling the glittering toy at once a bad name  a counterfeita piece of palaisroyal paste we know of old that mrs gore shines in the delineation of hard worldly women why then could not she vary her figure for once making her helen as brilliant ns she pleased in wit beauty and ambitionperilled by this very brilliancybut still genuine andnotasnow thepoorhack of fashion all efforts and pretences and coquetries who tums her back on her family whenever she wants to rise and throws herself penitently into their arms as often as her fortunes fall we looked for a millamant and in her place behold a mayfair lioness far better does blanche the pearl keep the promise of her name as sister daughter wife she is  a veritable margaret foiling the false brilliant with her purity and exquisite delicacy of colour yet even here mrs gore has not been able to rise superior to old conventions if  to be pearl is best what need was there of giving to the innocence beauty and holy wisdom of her heroine the sanction of fashion i well is mrs gore aware not only that a real mrs john watts could never have become the rage with the suddenness here described but what is more that she would not society is a strange complex thing and the step from absolute retirement to the observation of all observers may be taken by a una without peril but cannot without pain  still less per saltnm we had hoped after mrs gores rest from production that she would have given us something more natural and less novell than this tale of surprises conversions reformations vide sir george downham and judgments as set j forth in the fate of the llartingham title she j is always smart and amusingbut will she never more be probable  after what has been said no person of any moderation will expect a more precise account of how the diamond sparkled and through what amount of vicissitudes the pearl kept its purity some of the sketches of character in this novel are lively the picture of the household of the peerbishop is as graphic in ita grimness and its primness as most that we have looked upon other hits seem almost personal from the unnecessary and ineffective sharpness with which they are launched as usual mrs gore ranges herself on the side of the movement yet as too frequently happens it would seem as if she could not satisfactorily get to an endloflur task without glorifying her popular characswlth stars and gartersnot to add  chariots aaj horses and fifty men to run before them  the diamond and the pearlt tins is a novel in mrs gores best style founded upon

of that george  we understand each other sufficiently on most points for you to know that the chief thing to which i hold is family connexion  replied the old gentleman drily  in all treaties of

molly bawn lcty bavrn by thc author of  phyllis london smith and elder we must commence by drawing a distinction between a coquette and a flirt lest such praises as we are inclined to bestow upon the heroine of this book should bc misunderstood and interpreted as approval of the general practises of flirtation a coquet ti1 likes admiration anel so does a flirt and both of them are induced to go out of their way to seek it but the coquette seeks admiration and strives to make herself attractive rather for the sake of flattering her own vanity and of being a focus of attraction to the other sex the flirts ulterior aim is to win love which she does not reciprocate it is for this that she courts admiration when she has won the love at which she has been aiming she is content to throw it away and to seek a new conquest the coquette need not have any arrure pewee of winning real affection homage not love is what she craves if she finds that she has unwittingly won the latter she is apt to draw in her horns and tobe dismayed at the results of her folly she likes attentions but not intentions and admiration without affection the two terms are often used synonymously yet if a difle renee does exist it is such as we have stated the flirt is heartless and selfish thc coquette impulsive anel vain but nothing worse having thus defined we may premise that molly bawn is a thorough lil le coquette her coquetry may almost bc called artless yet coquetry it undoubtedly is she is pretty aud she is aware of the fact what young lady is so gifted anel withal unconsious of her endowmentr her temperament is foreshadowed in the opening chapter where she and her halibrother and sisterinlaw are awaiting the arrival of the guest who is to be mollys fate hereafter tired of waiting for this late arrival molly stares at herself in a glass and laments that she has  taken such pains with her hair and attire generally then she says to her brother  john since t hero is no one else to admire nie do say whether you think it or net i am the prettiest person you ever saw molly strikes up a warm friendship with the newcomer luttrell within a few hours of his arrival she at once confesses herself overjoyed at his arrival but the reason she assigns is characteristic of herif you only knew as well as 1 do the terrible neverending dullness of this place you would undtstand how one could long for the coming of any tii like congreves fair amoret molly is coquette aad cy at once she likes to be admired and to receive att nt lons  she might doubtless would lee styled forward by ni 1 ni ii ls and straitlaced people but she is coy of winning love and even at tie idea of awakening it yet she recounts t  luttrell with narre candour the diverse proposals which she even at nineteen has already received from the successive imiits of the parish and other admirers luttrell is soon hopehvsly in love yet it is some time before molly reciprocates his affections but a temporary tiff between them brings malters to a climax and he proposes she accepts him ritt somo momentary hesitation but shows thc real ntate of ber feelings when she says to bc made love to always every day would hill me ncverthc less they are engaged and before luttrell leaves moll receives an invitation to visit her grandfather a wealthy landed proprietor wdiom old age ill health and illtemper combined have made a misanthropical tyrant mollys mother committed a mesalliance as an amherst in old mr amhersts eyes when she became the second wife of mr massercene an irish gentleman of small means and though she was his favourite daughter he foreswore all further communication with her till now he has ignored molly and two other grandchildren marcia amherst and philip shadwell stand highest in his good graces waiting eagerly to stand in his shoes when he shall pass over to the majority these two have engaged themselves to each other the old man realises the motives of their devotion to him and his goodwill is not increased by the discovery of a halffinished letter from marcia to her mother lamenting her grandfathers tenacity of life nor by learning that shadwell is speculating upon his expectations by means of post obits molly soon carries all before her at herst royal where luttrell soon joins the party her coquetry conquers shadwell and also one plantagenet potts whose name and characteristics of ugliness and gooel nature are hardly original we fear molly is however pained when she finds that she has wron philip shadwells love and strives to keep him at a distance luttrell is naturally jealous and wc are afraid to say how many lovers quarrels are recorded between them thrice at least in thc course of the book is their engagement broken off only to be speedily renewed with increased warmth when molly coaxingly rubs her cheek against lu trolls sleeve like a spaniel courting a caress the citadel surrenders unconditionally we can hardly say that we should like a sister or daughter of ours to play the hoyden as does molly lest wrorse should befall them  and yet we must confess that there is a charin in the wayward and coquettish heroine which makes us condone as soon as we have censured when her love has once been really kindled she is devoted to luttrell though the latters expectations are meagre while philip shadwell her cousin is heir presumptive to the twenty thousand a year of herst royal so soon as his grandfather shall be good enough to take his departure we cannot say that molly is an unnatural character we have actually known girls more or less like her whose coquetry was only skin deep and whose affection was wann trusting sincere and honest it is part of the licence of an author to combine this amount of eccentricity of character with faultlessness of face and figure and with a voice that entrances all who hear her sing admitting that a molly bawn is a possible though a very rare occurrence in life we may then say that the story has a natural and unaffected tone throughout and that thc reality of the conversations and predicaments and thc absemcc of artificiality in thc other characters which compose the setting to this jewel are quite refreshing after thc amount of trashy novels which it has been our fate to wade through of late if the tone of the conversations were less natural and thc pictures less artistically drawn molly might at once appear a flirt whose good points were inconsistent with her predilections there is no striking incident throughout thc book  the interest depends upon the vivacity of the narration to which we give all credit thc several walking gentlemen and ladies play their parts well and keep the piece going admirably there is a good comedy of errors wherein a sir penthony stafford has to woo and win his own wife whom he has married without previous acquaintance and under a special agreement that so soon as the ceremony was over they should separate for ever a curious will of an uncle which made their marriage the sole condition of succeeding to his estate is thc reason assigned for this eccentric arrangement but wc must parenthetically state that legally the conditions would have been inoperative in the absence of specific trusts of which the author makes no mention this sort of will is a favourite though impossible resource of novelists how molly breaks her silken fetters with luttrell only to rivet them anew how her brother dies suddenly and leaves her and his family destitute how she disdain her grandfathers offer that she shall live with him al his heiress and leave her sisterinlaw to starve how 6he becomes a star upon the stage of the concertroom in order to support his brothers wielow and family  how in the end she find herself mistress of herst royal anel the inevitable sequel results we recommend our readers to study for themselves the book though it portrays coquetry is singularly free from the least soupcon of coarseness and would not corrupt a girl in her teens which is a good deal to be able to say of any modern novel which at the same time has though faculty of being clever and amusing,englishfiction

the  academy  bureau on account of sarah by e h w we have read nineteen chapters of this novel but must go to press before we have finished our perusal meanwhile we make haste to say that as far as we have gone the novel pleases us very much indeed it is singularly fresh auke in structure and in imagination it is aglow with good feeling buoyancy and bright humour and the author manages the greek chorus method with unexpected skill if the remainder of the novel is as good as the portion we have been reading a proposd for publication will bo reported in next weeks academy  on account of sarah by eyre hussey  did you ever read a greek play  is the question with whioh this book opens  if not the author adds 411 humbly opine that you have lost very little fun mr hussy then explains the nature of the chorus in order that he may have recourse to it later the story is a comedy played on a somewhat crowded stage but amusing and skilful with pleasant character studies macqueen 6s  on account of sarah by eyre hussey macqueen to err is human to apologise is gratuitous folly mr hussy has told a capital story in the first person and then just because he has found it necessary to put in an occasional explanatory paragraph he must needs excuse himself in a long excursus on the methods of greek tragedy even so he is not content but persistently reminds the reader of his error in art by prefixing the word chorus to each interpolation and writing thereafter in hasty and shamefaced jerks pecca fortiter my good sir very few people will find you out and they will forgive far worse sins for the sake of jim buchanans high spirits and sarahs exasperating ways for a few pages at the beginning and end of the book there is a mistaken attempt at seriousness but all the rest is frankly incoherent and delightfullyreadable,englishfiction

i olv blaki gd work a novel john lady   0  ly jeaffreeon auther of i a book about dotos thni volumes chapman and hall decidedly this is one of the best novels of the season its defect which is mall arises from overimitation of mr wilkie collins the story is told in the narratives of three people like that of i the woman in whit and the solemn injunction of one diarist julian gower that tabitha tree for whom it is written shall not alter a word imitates too closely one of the weak points of the adopted model also for the sake of increasing interest olive blake while about her good work is made to perplex and grieve the excellent tabitha with mysteries that lead to less than nothing and that she can only explain by saying that it gave her pleasure to torment her friend seeing how nobly she bore torture and how faithful she was to her own heart in spite of every doubt thrust painfully upon it mystery so made is not legitimately made but in good truth mr jeaifreson is not dependent upon story for the success of his novel and if it were far more faulty in construction than we think it to be the book would be read with pleasure the most noticeable fact is that the inevitable defects of a tale told by triple autobiography are so far overcome that a man being the author of the book and two of the supposed autobiographers women they do absolutely write like women nice discrimination of character expressed naturallyit is easy enough to express artificiallythrough style would be too much to expect but mr jeaffreson sufficiently distinguishes between the two journalsone that of the active and brave olive blake vigorous in her i good work b7 labouring for years with fearless determination spending all her means to right a wronged woman though success proves her own marriage null the other that of tabitha tree whose womans life of disappointed love takes vengeance on the world only in smiling selfdenial and unobtrusive beneficence it is much that in the journals of these persons the sense of beauty in detail the minute notice of character the love of nature the merciful construction of evil and the faith iin god and in all goodness by which women make life beautiful has been preserved the book ts in direct con1 treat to that novel of mr salas of which we have lately spoken it is running over with the milk of human kindness which that writer accounts it clever to reject as lait ddnene used only by the sickly there is in tris stoyo olire blakes good work no trace of sickliness the faith in life is though expressed through the persons of women as manly as it is generous mr jeaffreson instead of proving that the men who please us are all knaves at heart pleasantly disappoints us here and there by showing us an honest kindly man where the experience of novel readers would lead them to see preparation for an act of villany solomon easys lawyer is an example of this and the good clergyman of the old school himself with  the corn  country  in which he lives the harvest felds he vists the lanes through which he drives ia his gig and his household with the two girls in whom the story cetre is a sketch more after the manner of the vicar of waked than of the woman in lihije we took up mr jeufreoms novel hardly expecting to be pleased for his book about doctors was unsatisfactory but the first chapters of olive blake at once proved that he has in him the right spirit of an artist and the wholo work convinces us that good as this novel is better will follow it unless the taste of the day lead its author astray into a de3ire for the couotiou of sensation  plots  olive blakes good work  a novel by john cordy jeaffreson 3 vols chapman  hall in olive blakes good work mr jeaffreson has made a great advance upon his former novels good as they were the story told is an extremely interesting one a story that will certainly be read through and in some parts more than once by any one who begins it the plan does not reveal itself to the guesses of the sagacious reader until he conies face to face with the solution at the authors own appointed time the reader will also feel compelled to attend to his own duty towards the book  to read it steadily as he reads a living man whom he needs to understand not to advance his knowledge by skipping intermediate steps under the penalty of spoiling his own delight in the authors labours the author docs his duty not only by providing a very interesting story but by telling it remarkably well there is and always will be a fascination in stories of circumstantial evidence there is the hunting instiuct roused to track a fact through all the doublings and windings of concealment a reader loves to assist at the unravelling of a plot or the detection of evidence for himself and not to have it flashed out to him in halfa dozen sentences of explanation in the last chapter where the characters are grouping for the final tableau of happiness and poetical justice previous to the fall of the curtain mr jeatfreson has selected the method inaugurated by mr wilkie collins in his  woman in white the main actors in the drama narrate their own immediate share of the business aud speak ol nothing but what they individually know and feel by this means the reader is kept from seeing too far before him the first part of the story is laid in suffolk in the corn countya district mr jeatfreson knows well and describes with the affection of one who is proud of belonging to the shires the pictures of the old rectory and the kuy quiet fertile country which seems always basking in the sun are charming the rev solomon easy in his canonicals silk stockings and stately silverbuckled shoes examining the villageboys according to the dtclaraticnes of the statutes of the benefaction is a picture from the life the old rectors drives in the ponyphaeton through the lanes and fields to see the crops and his mild childlike complacency at being told he can drive a bargain are all so natural that the reader finds himself asking the childs question is it all true  it is not till the middle of the second volume that he begins to suspect that he is in for a tale with a plot in it the early life of the two sisters in tue quiet rectory the motherly elder sister and her young charge julian gower with his brotherly love all naturally prepare the reader for what comes that the elder sister loves him with the love of a woman and does not discern that to him she is only a great comfort instead of a great hope the painful awakening that her childsister and not herself has won the prize and the loyalty with which she contends against her own disappointment keeping from all reaction of injustice and bitterness are made very touching aud very true mr jeafvreson shows his knowledge of women by a manly aud delicate reverence for them for which women will thank him which shows a far deeper insight than the supercilious display of some writers and some moralists who profes to think that dissimulation and inbred fa lshood rre the badge of all their tribe one of the very best passages in his book is where he goes rather out of his way to pay his own homage to give his owu testimony to their deive to be true und to do the thing that is riht the way in which the older sister bears her disappointment is very skilfully managed th readers sympathy never borders on contempt although we do not think that mr jeaitreson need have protested so energetically aboat her crimson blushes there was no cause for shaine or any sense of humiliation  she was mistaken but she had been misled by circumstances likely to have misled any one and she took up the penalty so bravely that the reader respects her as if she hod won instead of lost in the second volume the mystery of the book begius etty the young sister betrothed to julian linds out that she does not care for him lie is absent pushing his fortune abroad to enable him to keep a wife the grandfather had died some time previously leaving them in thc position whicn obliged them to earn their own living etty disgusted at schoolkeeping discontented with thc prospect of her long engagement elopes leaving no clue behind her except that sho is gone away with a military man elderly ugly taciturn whom nobody had ever suspected of being aware of her existence beyond though most distantly polite recognition the elder sister in the shanie and sorrow of the discovery abruptly leaves the cottage where they had lived since their graudfathers death and goes no one knows where to hide herself from all who ever knew her from this part the mystery becomes highly complex olive blake who has only once appeared before becomes ono of the actors  she marries according to a family compact the friend of though mau with whom etty left her home an excellent man of mature age she tells her own part of the storyhow after she had been a few months married she has a strange visitor a young and beautiful lady who declares that she is married to her husband now arthur petersham was the most unlikely mau in the world to do anything of the sort the reader never for a moment suspects him the character is well managed the reader is made to understand his powers of influence though he only appears in narrative and never in his own person of course the wife does not believe ettys story the marriage she asserts as having taken place at a certain church is not on the register her story is wildly improbable in all its details when her husband comes back she tells him the incident his explanation is perfectly coherent and satisfactory etty never appears again and olive blake never troubles her head further about her this is treated as her sin and we think morbidly exaggerated by the author olive blake is the least natural of all the characters she is too much ofthe personage so frequently met with in old novels who has a mysterious knowledge of every ones affairs and who interferes in the crisis of everybodys destiny that olive blake should once startle a person whom she had never seen by her shrewd intuition may be accepted but when it occurs several times it becomes a trick of machinery rather than a trait of character after awhile in her sorrow for the loss of her own child she remembers etty and is morbidly haunted by the recollection of her misery aud her own hardheartedness in though midst of this it comes to her knowledge that her husband excellent sensible affectionate as he has seemed to her and to the world hitherto without a flaw on his surface has in one flagrant instance at least and very recently been a profligate under aggravated circumstances and the conviction is present with her that ettys story is true without waiting to mourn over herself or to think of her own position she separates from her husband and resolves to find etty and to do her justice as she had ample cause for her own separation it excites no surprise or question in society and with mystery and secrecy and unrelenting persistence she sets herself to the work of unravelling the iniquity of her husbands wrong towards etty the difficulties are enormous all clue has been so skilfully and carefully destroyed so many years have elapsed that discovery of evidence seems hopeless the reader is made to assist in the search and to pick up and add link to link of the chain meanwhile the fortunes of the elder sister go on she too has hid herself with care from all who ever knew her she has to be found not by the reader for the reader knows all she is doing but by her friends she has to discover as she believes her sisters child to hear from a strange lady who addresses her in the park a story which is half of it true and half of it intended to mislead her into the belief of her sisters death after a life of shame this portion of the novel we object to very much indeedit is a fraud on the purest and noblest feelings of her sisteraudthough entered into with the best of intentions is so cruel so unnecessary that every reader will resent it because olive blake chose to play at providence what right had she to outrage a good and patient and deeplysuffering woman by a story she knew to be false and for the sake of effecting a possible good in an improbable manner  the elder sister deserved better than to be mado a dupe through the whole story olive blake in spite of her good work is detestableher character is not enough worked out to make her strange acts a study of human nature sho remains throughout the machine her conduct to the elder sister after the elaborate plot for bringing her and julian together has succeeded aud we hope she is to be as happy as she deserves is atrociousno other word will suit to try her fine nature to the utmost to see if she can bo unselfish and generous and trust her husband under the extremity of false appearances she goads her with suggestions of diabolical malice and when she has administered her tortuie till her victim faints she allows her to discover that she has been merely trying her olive blake being the mainspring of the book ought to have been made more like a human being or at least to have been developed with more care so that the reader might have accepted her for the sake of increasing his stock of psychological knowledgebut as she stands she is a disagreeable improbability as to etty the victim too much stress is laid on the accident of a legal ceremony it does not in the least lessen her wickedness  it only renders her less unfortunate and gives a reason why arthur petersham should find it worth his while to secrete her in a lunatic asylum after he had abandoned her and married another woman with all faults found aud objections made the reader will not fail to read the story of  olive blakes good work from first to last for the sake of the story and he will return to its pages for the sake of though many noble and excellent sentiments which in the interest of following the story he may not read with the attention they merit mr jeaffreson will yet write a novel far superior to olive blakes good work  he possesses though requisite qualities for telling a story to which there will be no exceptions,englishfiction

jack and three jills0 there is a good deal that is clever and more that is amusing in these two neat volumes which in their sober dress of plain red sides and salmonpink back appear to aim at looking like fiction in handyvolumeclassics1 clothing the reader will probably be sufficiently interested to read them through from cover to cover having done so he will probably wonder why he took the trouble as there is no particular plot nor any remarkable excitement and there is a perceptible though perhaps not easily defined flavour of vulgarity about the book not that the characters are vulgar people jack who by the way is george for the first seventy pages is evidently meant to be a sort of pelham written up to date who succeeds in life because somehow he cannot help doing so who belongs to the best clubs and moves in  county  and other very superior society but somehow we feel him to belong rather to bayswater or bloomsbury than to mayfair while yet we are ready to confess as mr russell lowell does in one of his pleasant essays that we tremble before the effort to define the vulgarity of which wre are conscious the fascinating widow or grasswidow with a past which is not a favourite subject of conversation who is the first of the three  jills is a good sketch and the relations between her and jack are capitally described jill the third the american heiress whom mr severn the successful and very selfsatisfied hero ultimately marries is also a very nice girl indeed her father cyrus napoleon washington q rock belongs to the tribe of gilead p beek he too has made his pile and by means of those wonderful oilwells which as mr rock explains providence for its own reasons has confined to the united states  jack and three jills by f c philips 2 vols london  ward  downey he is a good sketch of the shrewd drilyhumorous american selfmade man who has a proper respect for dollars without being in the least purseproud he likes literature and art he enjoys modern paris much and old london even more rummaging out every famous old spot with intense delight his daughter is an american girl of the good sort to prove whether jack severns affections were truly for her or for the dollars mr rock gives out that he is ruined jack however comes triumphantly through the ordeal and we are glad that the bells ring for his wedding with elizabeth rock and not with jill number two the rather vixenish lizzie vivian who swayed his heart for awhile the book will not bear quotation  its merits lie in the ease and fluency of the narrative the brightness and entrain of the style and a certain freshness in the sketching rather than drawing of the characters in the cheerful little drama its worst blemishes are faults of taste which collectively become distinctly bad taste and are to be regretted,englishfiction

a lonely life by the author of  wise as a serpent c eight illustrations london houlston and sons the life depicted in this novel is intended to teach us  how sublime a thing it is to suffer and be strong so excellent a purpose places it above the category of books written only to amuse though the style is so easy and vigorous the subordinate characters are so lifelike and the conversations so characteristic and spontaneous as to insure that result also we like the hero and heroine least of  all the group whose fortunes are revealed to us the peculiar nature of their early troubleswhich to a great extent isolate them from the rest of the world and have to be endured in silence seems to put them always on the defensive they are extremely good but it would be too much to expect that they should be also genial and gracious we cannot if we would reveal the whole of the plot for we confess ourselves unableto thread the labyrinth of ancestral wickedness which has robbed harold seton of the hopes and happiness natural to his youth and supposed position and we are furtherbewildered when at the close of the volume the tangled skein is supposed to be tnade straight for us these mysteries however in no respect affect theintrinsic value of the book and the authoress could well afford to dispense with the complications arising from misplaced passion and unhallowed ties she has not we are happy to say the hardihood to handle such subjects with the coarse freedom of the sensation school nor has she that rare union of delicacy and power which enabled mrs gaskell miss evans and one or two other lady novelists to make them the vehicles of profound moral teaching but she might fearlessly trust to her powers of description and her shrewd delineation of character to rivet the attention of her readers the heros painful doubts about his parentage are of course the iaison detre of his solitude but why the poor heroine should be placed in a similarly questionable position we cannot understand the lofty spirit of a portionless and dependent orphan would have been sufficiently tried in so worldly a circle as her aunts and so wvould the disinterestedness of her lover the story opens with an admirable description of a spot on the southern coast of spain  the monrstery faced nearly due west commanding a long sweep of the broken undulating coast line it was a bright summers day with just breath enough of soft wind to bring the water rippling against the rocks below the terrace with a soothing murmur loud enough to mingle in a dreamy way with the hum of the cicalas in tme trees around and with the faint rustle of the vine leaves and to turn over and over again the leaves of the olives and send a silver shimmer over their sombre green here and there over the sea were scattered a few fishing boats their sailshoisted in the vain hope of catching the fickle breeze as it rose and fell gleaming snowy white in the blazing sunlight close to the monastery itself there was a narrow line of golden sand brokenat intervals by jagged masses of dark rock intervening between the vineyards and the sea but at a little distance the rich bright green of the vines mingled with the more sombre hue of the olives seemed dippinginto the deep blue water while every touch of colour along the coast from the gaily painted boat or scarlet cap of some stray fishennan to the bright dress of some coquettish peasant girl shone out distinct and vivid in the clear air on the terrace a young englishman is seeking counsel from padre felipe whose lofty and energeticmindhas gained great influence over himt harold seton has been relating how somepapers which fell into his hands on his fathers sudden death bore the startling endorsement is harold seon mz vy son or not0i

he feels his own title to be doubtful may on his death pass undisputed to ralphs children padre felipe adviseshim to enter the church and with high resolves and hopes estranged from earth harold does so we next find him rector of middleborough and the authoress excels in describing the jealousies and trivialities the indifference to public aina and the zeal in private spites which distinguish the narrow and divided circles of a typical country town how harold defies conventionalities and reforms abuses how he scandalises the exclusive and daunts the belligerent our readers must discover for themselves foremost among the autocrats of middleborough are mrs thornton and lady battersby smooth selfish elegant creatures who had rather not be told anything distressing lady battersby has two daughters one  faultily faultless icily null  but the other terribly unorthodox and a thorn in the side of her aristocratic mamma agnes battersby is young wild and high spirited and so revolts against the affectations and formalities of her mother and sister that she adopts the opposite extreme of slang and audacity if she were not so innocent and goodhearted she would be simply intolerable  even as it is nve trust very few girls of twenty would rush into such immediate and unbounded confidences with a young and handsome rector even retailing to him scandals wvhich most matrons would prefer to ignore agnes is a great horsewoman and persuades harold seton to let her ride a highmettled mare of his they have a terrible accident against a closed tollgate and agnes is crippled for life aided by harolds counsel and sympathy she passes bravely through this fiery ordeal of calamity and from the couch to which she is thenceforth a prisoner gives invaluable help to all his benevolent schemes of necessity she is on intimate terms with his curates but we are rather startled to find one of them announcing to agnes his engagement after the following fashion though she has been his confidant throughout the love affair and says that her invalid condition entitles her to  unlimited platonics arthur in a state of temporary insanity burst in upon agnes soon after luncheon and throwing himself down upon his knees beside her couch bestowed a shower of kisses upon her  get up and behave yourself you savage   she said  i need not ask what has happened  oh agnes you are inspired  it was just as you said she would not have me because she thought i didnt know and when she found i did she was in a fair way i believe to persist in her refusal because she thought i had proposed because i pitied her but it is all right now and i am perfectly madpositively drunk with happiness you need not tell me thatlook at my hair  he coloured furiously  oh agnes i beg your pardon a thousand times i am very

arthurs suit to the same lady only once like enoch arden harolds selfrepression breaks down in bestowing on evelyn a parting embrace he owns that he has alwvays loved her which is the more

thc shadow of the rope by e w hornung chatto  windus this is not so much the story of a murder as a narrative of the experiences of a woman who was acquitted after trial for murder it covers the year which elapsed between the time of her trial and the day upon which her honour was vindicated by the discovery of the real murderer yet it is not a detective story and the authors work is above the level of his material as bearing upon that fact the following paragraph taken from this novel and dealing with one of its characters has a certain interest of its own  44 the novels of charles langholme were chiefly remarkable for their intricate plots and for the hope of better things that breathed through the cheap sensation of the best of them but it was a hope that had been deferred a good many years his manner was better than his matter  indeed an incongruous polish was said by the literary to prevent langholme from being a first favourite either with the great public or the little critics as a maker of plots however he still had humble points the public thought mr hornungs heroine guilty of the murder and resented her acquittal hoots and yells rang in her ears as she left the old bailey she was without a friend in the world she had a proud sensitive nature and was the kind of woman who earns the name of lady what becomes of such characters sentenced to life instead of to death in this censorious scandalloving world of ours mr hornungs story is a fairly successful attempt to answer the question,englishfiction
  tomorrow  by victoria cross walter scott publishing company this novel comes to us marked third edition from which we must assume that the public demand for it has been considerable it is not easy to discover why perhaps it is the air of spurious philosophy and the specious assumption of a knowledge of the world perhaps it is the concentration of the author upon a single passion there is nothing in  tomorrow  to excuse or explain the popularity of the book a young man of a most selfcentred and displeasing type fails to publish his books in england because he is too frank but he knows he is a genius  what need to tell me i possessed a power that inflamed every vein that heated all the blood in my system that filled though they seemed buoyant every cell of my brain  as much need as to tell the expectant mother she has a life within her own but paris is more broadminded and to paris he goes the story is occupied mainly with his relations with his friend howard a poet and his loveaffair with his cousin as to the former howard burns his manuscript and kills his dog as to the latter lucia dies on her weddingday of  that last year of virgin purity of life that had broken her strength to bear the book is on this level throughout it is an example of sheer hysteria and possibly hysteria may be taken by the ignorant and innocent for passion they may be assured however that it is nothing of the sort this story has no kind of claim to consideration as a reflection from life even its absurdities are not amusing,englishfiction
less black than were painted less black thar were painted by james payn 3 vol chatto and wind us we remember once hearing a story anent the bethnal green museum which recurs to us in forcible illustration of this novel one of the native visitors staring openmouthed at the pictures is said to have reached the climax of her admiration when a sympathetic friend imparted in awestruck whisper the hardly credited information that  they were all done by and i canvas coloured to order heads arms and legs grouped by machinery and pictures turned out by the gross was what inartistic experiences had evidently suggested to the  untutored mind as the natural order of things les extremes southeast touchent our experience tends to a rooted belief in the existence of a class of machinemade novels and our admiration is hardly second to that of the traditional old lady from whom we quote when we meet with one bearing unmistakeable traces of handwork whatever heresies may obtain concerning critics it is nevertheless a fact that to be able as in the present instance to pronounce a novel original in conception artistic in treatment and thoroughly readable as a result does afford the reviewer most genuine satisfaction but we must sketch the story which has won from us so warm a meed of praise and in so justifying our opinion we shall be doing no injustice to the reader since to indicate the plot is to show the least charm of the book it illustrates the laureates ideal being the story of a boys  maiden passion for a maid which in the end  makes a man of him it is a tale of true love begun in earliest childhood and beset by almost every possible social obstacle richard talbot the son of squire talbot of talbot tower is the hero and when we ae first introduced to him on a visit to his grandmother lady earnshaw he is a wrelldrawn and very loveable specimen of an etonian of seventeen something of the schoolboy something too perhaps of the scapegrace and certainly all the loveableness cling to him throughout his history his father leads the life of a religious recluse stiriving to  live down  the sins of a dissolute youth and between the morbid man and thc highspirited boy there is much love but little sympathy necessarily thrown much for companionship into the society of grooms and gamekeepers dick naturally develops his strongly inherited instincts for their pursuits and perhaps quite as naturally falls boyishly in love with the bright beautiful little daughter of george parkes a gentleman whose antecedents are hardly worthy even of his present position in the squires preserves lucy and  master richard  are about the same age and some episodes of the  calflove stage are prettily sketched a kiss however which is exchanged and overlooked in most humorous circumstances brings affairs to the knowledge of the elders and to the consequent parting friends of course interfere  the clergyman and his wife and dicks  cousins and his aunts and even his own especial chum  pussy greene all protest in their several ways against the impossibilities ot such a marriage and finally the girl herself gives back her troth for a village maiden of seventeen it may be objected that she evinces quite exceptional gifts of sense and resolution  and we are afraid that the wisdom and tenderness which events subsequently show her to possess might be deemed exceptional in a maiden of any degree but it is nevertheless a consistent character throughout and a very charming one dick  gets over it to all appearance and goes to college is somewhat wild and reckless and when ha comes into his fortune contrives to dissipate it with alarming rapidity but through it all it is evident that the rare capability  to love one maiden only and to cleave to her is his and and in the end they marry and are as happy in spite of all drawbacks as such true love deserved the social complications which ensue on their marriage are extremely well told but hardly admit of quotation  handwork however is as evident in the sketching of the minor characters as in the distinct portraits of the hero and heroine we took an especial fancy to lucys good ugly dwarfish  aunt susan whose  piety waa of the most crude and simple sort it had no colours but thento use a vulgar but very expressive phraseit  washed  v ii p 172 equally good in her way too ia mrs freeman the before named rectors wife who  had not an angle about her except at the tip of her tongue and who indulges in that most provoking habit from which we all occasionally suffer at our friends hands of  having foreseen it all alongwhatever it was  pussy otherwise leonard greene is one of the full lengths and seems to have been done from the life he is delightful and gives frequent other evidence than the authors word of possessing a sense of humourthat precious gift which makes even ruffians endurable to him who possesses it and the absence of which in the gentler sex is the cause of no little of their unhappiness and discontent v ii p 171 we have no space to particularise or to quote from the other dramatis personae it is emphatically a novel worth reading and not the least of its attractions to us is the fact of ita being true to its title pessimism in so many forms ia fashionable nowadays that it is pleasant to be reminded in a roundabout way that we are after all less black than were painted the novelist in these times finds a larger audience than even the popular preacher and it is refreshing to find one occasionally who is not unmindful of his responsibilities and who holds the wholesome theory that in the long run  beauty of form has but a short start of cleverness and but a little longer one of goodness which once having overtaken it in the affections moves on with strides that the other can never rival v i p 59 we call this healthy doctrine and it is worked out without a suspicion of preaching which indeed would destroy the effect but as a set off against the detestable aubumtressed heroines from whom we so often suffer and who seem to rely mainly on their back hair and their bigamous tendencies for our sympathy the novel which makes a lucy lindon the central interest we hold worthy of especial recognition,englishfiction

israel kalisch by w l george constable 6s it is not a necessary fault to a novel that it be a tract some of the best of novels have been tracts as for instance one of our conquerors anna karenina crime and punishment jude the obscure the question is what sort of a tract is it if anna karenina had been a cushion on which the objectlesson was thumped instead of being a living soul who demonstrated it in her vitality her book would still have been a tract but it would have been no more and in israel kalisch its eponymous hero is less a living soul than a convenient cushion not that mr george identifies himself with his sermon that need not be the jewish lad who grew to a man of striking appearance flaming red hair and beard pale skin and wonderful blue eyes who by his large idealism and quick sympathies things always anarchic in their tendency became an active anarchist and finally met his death by the misthrowing of a bomb may not hold mr georges views and it does not matter whether he do or do not the point is that he is more a lay figure for these views than a recognisable soul of whom they are an integral part the other characters in the book live though they are rather distinguished by their description and by the employment of certain phrases and actions than by a real difference in personality but they and kalisch live as it were by reason of their environment and the strength of mr georges book lies in his depiction of that environment that was so in the city of light it is even more so now he describes evidently as the result both of fairly wide experience and painstaking examination certain aspects of cosmopolitan life in new york and london where israel lives his life struggling painfully that it should be lived and seeks to understand the wretched pattern that society in its cowardice and avarice has made of life men like leidunvitz and warsch women like sonia and even karsavina whom israel saves from suicide and who loves him wildly for his idealism and personal beauty are like points where that environment has uttered itself in an expressive symbol the dirt and poverty that being in a nonenglish atmosphere do not necessarily degrade the fierceness of those that are ground down the strikes that fail the desperation that this inevitably engenders the curious sense one of the most remarkably accurate things in the book of getting outside the english classstratification in the very midst of an english system  are all faithfully presented it is more than photography it is more than stereoscopy for there is atmosphere and yet the book fails in a literary sense and not only because the style is without form or value it will be read however and it will have its effect for it is good journalism  5rail kalisch iby w l george 6s conbtalble there has been a definite  purpose  in each of the two earlier novels which mr george has written but neither in  a bed of roses  nor in he city of light  was the essential motif so insistently obtrusive as it is in this study of the life and death of an intellectual anarchist from its very nature the story is one of sordid life on the continent in new yqrk and in london but the sordidness is merely that of the material circumstances in which the characters live and the tale is saved from being  unpleasant  in the shavian sense of the term by the subsidiary loveaffairs of several of the characters and in particular by the devoted passion of karsavina for the hero israel kalisch the conception of israel kalisch is firstrate while he is thoroughly sympathetic with his hero mr george is not unduly carried away by his creation and he uses kalisch very skilfully as a foil to other of his fellow anarchists the book indeed is extremely clever mr george has the gift of being able to put a political sermon or rather a political debate into the form of fiction without either destroying the value of his real thesis or obtruding the teacher too much upon the storyteller and so long as he retains this power he will be read with interest by people to whom most of the views held by his characters are utterly obnoxious,englishfiction
victor and vanquished by mary cecil hay 3 vols hurst fc blackett the great feature in  victor and vanquished is the extreme mobility of lip which characterises the actors ladies and gentlemen alike are found with quivering trembling and shaking lips the moment their feelings undergo the slightest shock as the story is highly sensational and situations more or less ex ting abound these good people go through fe with many contortions of countenance here is also a great deal of crying and kissing id a general want of selfrespect among the laracters the most remarkable episode in ie tale is the death of the hero who makes ie edifying end usually allotted to the conimptive young lady this gentleman is the ghtful heir to a baronetcy who having been njustly sentenced to penal servitude the snnexion of ideas seems curiously close in dine minds is now out on a ticketofleave nd is ensconced in a cottage at high ithelston on his family estate here he is ccupied partly in saving money to pay off he sum supposed to have been lost by his orgery partly in educating the son of the eal culprit who has been deserted by his ather himself a resident in the immediate leighbourhood gerard is also endeavouring o prove his legitimacy and to oust the eigning baronet these occupations are lowever unhappily interrupted by a chance neeting between gerard and the villain relfrey when the former pitches the latter into m old mineshaft in a lake with the apparent esult of drowning him it requires no great istuteness to opine that so profligate a villain vas not born to be drowned in fact the jvhole thing has been planned by him with a riew to gerards conviction of his murder and iris own escape from a neighbourhood which was becoming embarrassing the result is a remarkable trial in which all known laws of evidence are set aside and gerard is acquitted of au act which is sworn to by three eyewitnesses in consequence of the spirited declamation of an old woman who proves that the prisoner is a very good fellow and the deceased no better than he should be we do not complain of technical inaccuracy  few novelists know as well as dickens that  what the soldier said isnt evidence  but we are appalled at the suggestion of long independent speeches by the different witnesses in addition to the chartered libertinism of counsel with this episode the interest reaches its climax gerard of course proves his legitimacy and soon after dies his sister marries sir neil athelston his successor in whose house she has been a governess under a feigned name and who showed her the true touch of the quality of fictitious baronets by offering to seduce her when he thought she was unprotected miss marjorie castillain to whom he was engaged at that time consoles herself with a colonel of much gravity and wisdom that gentleman no doubt has his work before him for a more unnatural sister and daughter than this hoydenish damsel it is impossible to conceive indeed with the possible exception of the colonel there is not a lady or gentleman in the book,englishfiction
  the american prisoner bv eden phillnnffa methuen  co this book is laid in mr phillpottss familiar huntinggrounds but instead of being a study of dartmoor rustic life and character it is an adventurous romance centring round the great war prison near tor royal in the earliest days of last century there are rustic characters in it to be sure and some very good descriptions of dartmoor scenery but it is frankly an adventure story and not a novel of character rustic or otherwise it holds too for us the suggestion of an author whose true bent is the study of character and scenery and natural conditions as they affect character striving after a new effect a new vehicle of expression from a sense of expediency and forgetting his object as often as he becomes truly interested in his work this is not a pleasing or satisfying suggestion for one likes to feel that an author is wholehearted in his work that sense we do not have in reading the american prisoner and consequently we think that mr phillpotts has come very near to falling between two stools yet were this the work of an unknown writer it would be meritorious and promising as it is we look rather for achievement than promise the book is a painstaking and wellwrought experiment but we think the author would be well advised to follow faithfully what appears to be his own natural bent his dartmoor farming lore is most attractive reading and his conversations between labourers and their kind are excellent,englishfiction

  the little regiment and other episodes of the american civil war tttll  by stephen crane william heinemann mr crane has attempted the bold and dangerous task of writing two books on exactly the same subject from exactly the same standpoint and making use of exactly the same background this has proved a stumblingblock to many more experienced authors and it is high praise to say that the little regiment in every way a companion volume to the red badge of courage is not one whit behind it in power or picturesqueness it is true that war is a farreaching inexhaustible subject but mr crane does not content himself with birdseye views of the battlefield he takes his stand with the rank and file of the army with the men who fight wherever their feet are planted until more orders come knowing absolutely nothing of the general significance of their actions the awful monotony of his pictures is almost depressing  there is no room for variety of any kind the present volume is made up of six episodes the story entitled the little regiment stands out from the others as the most finished the most complete piece of work mr crane has given us it is a short sketch but brimful of the grim reality of war although individuals seem almost insignificant in such a picture each man is perfectly realised dan and billie live before our eyes and we feel sure we should recognise  the man who sat on the horsehair trunk  among a thousand as a word painting the little regiment is truly wonderful in every sentence we can hear even more clearly than in the red badge of courage the pantherlike screaming the witches crooning of the shells the cracking of the skirmishers the spattering and zipping of the bullets while through all these pulsates the fierce elation of the men amid the horrors great dashes of crimson and blobs of blue break occasionally through the dim and mystic clouds of grey mist and the whole demoniacal howling of the battle quivers in our brain for hours mr crane relies for his effects on daring and original colour similes he is a word artist of infinite resource and for everything he invents a special hue the sense of smell which plays such a prominent part in zolas debdcle is conspicuous by its absence we certainly miss the odeur de la guerre mr cranes peculiar genius is admirably adapted to the exigencies of the short story he writes at such fever heat and puts so much of the rush and turmoil of battle into his short quivering sentences that a longcontinued story like the red badge of courage comes as a strain to the mind of the average reader who closes the book with a genuine sigh of relief in these episodes the pace is faster the intensity more striking than ever  but the pauses between the stories give time for breathing compared with the little regiment the other episodes are more sketchy and less compact an indiana campaign is a pleasant piece of comedy which comes as a relief amid the allpervading gloom but mr crane lacks the necessary lightness of touch the veteran the story of an old man who meets his death in the flames while trying to rescue some colts is a trifle theatrical and commonplace a woman figures in three miraculous soldiers and a grey sleeve but she seems out of her element and only half realised a mystery of heroism a new version of an episode in the cave of adullam and a splendid psychological revelation of the feelings of a desperado is in itsway as perfect a piece of work as the little regiment though the tone is quieter and more subdued,englishfiction_contra
new novels katharine frensham by beatrice harraden blackwood  sons a lasting affection for a story called  ships that pass in the night may be a readers misfortune but is certainly neither his nor miss harradens fault but it does obscure the merits of some of her other stories this one is a study in temperaments not altogether well realized we have a man afflicted with too tender a conscience too sensitive a nature and too slender a power of expression restored to happiness and a balanced mind through the sympathy and devotion of the woman who gives her name to the story thornton as he is called is a distinguished man of science though the true scientific attitude and nature do not seem well suggested an unsympathetic and exacting wife has from the outset of their union wrecked his peace of mind and his career and even helped to spoil the affectionate relations between the father and his boy thornton is represented as being of so unselfish and chivalrous a nature that he finds it impossible to take his courage in both hands and end this distressing tyranny but at length and on this everything is supposed to turn he in a dream in his study speaks his mind and she also in a dream in an upper chamber becomes suddenly conscious of the true state of his feelings towards her the horror of this telepathic revelation kills her the situation is not easy of acceptance apart from that its effect on the nature of such a woman as she is made out to be is rather incredible a somethiog farfetched and laboured about much of the plot and circumstance is a contrast to the air of spontaneity and ease of ships that pass in the night the influence of the good heroine almost immediately sets in but she is not permitted to restore the sufferer wholly till the end eemorse reserve and a poorly imagined female evil genius stand between the pair whose respective auras as we are told with wearisome frequency are an excellent match a want of simplicity and too much iteration in the dialogue and sentiment are very visible to like the perfect woman nobly planned before whom everybody in a book falls in worship is perhaps always a little difficult a great part of the action of the story passes in norway and so we get some pleasant descriptions of the manners and customs of the country a very vivacious old danish governess is much to the fore throughout  katharine frensham by beatrice harraden blackwood 6s preliminary paragraphs have made it clear to all men that miss harraden has spent considerable time in norway during the preparation of her new romance otherwise the reader might be tempted to suspect that she had put in her local colour from a volume of travels and a phrasebook surely an experienced author should be too wise to let her background transform itself into a foregroundr yet this is what occurs throughout the novel miss harraden cannot convince herself that close accounts of norwegian local customs do not conduce to the dramatic effect of a story which concerns itself after all with english people and that atmosphere is not to be conveyed by scraps of foreign dialogue with translations in brackets the human problem set forth in katharine frensham demands a treatment more profound and subtle than the author has accorded it in one of his strongest books william dean howells wrought out with relentless logic the effect produced on two sensitive natures by an imagined guilt and a haunting dream here the motive is similar clifford thornton cannot rid himself of the sense that he is guilty of his wifes death because in a dream he has uttered his longrepressed bitterness and she in a dream heard his arraignment peculiar insight and skill are needed for such a psychological problem but in  katharine frensham  it is comfortably clear all along that clifford is going to escape from the shadows which indeed are only there to emphasise the coming light the book is pleasantly written and  knutty the quizzical danish governess is an amusing acquaintance but though  katharine frensham  may be a cultured and pleasing story it is not life or in any true sense literature,englishfiction_contra
tugeru aram wthat has mr wills made of bulwers idea  what will mr irving make of mr willss version of i eugene aram were questions much mooted when we last glanced at what the theatres were doing they were answered on the seventeenth of april when the new play was produced at the lyceum before a crowded and sympathetic audience with every accessory of scenery decoration and costume which the most fastidious admirer of realism could desire mr wills has made a few interesting tableaux out of what bulwer executed as a romance and conceived as a drama to which he doubted his own ability to do justice but he has not made a good play out of it any more than he reduced the readymade tragedy of the life and death of charles the first to the conditions of a good acting drama mr irving makes the most and the best of m1r willss tableaux but he is overweighted by the disproportion of his part and he has to struggle against the inherent unsuitability of the story of  eugene aram for representation on the stage at all unless it were given in its entirety mr wills claims to have adhered neither to bulwers romance nor to hoods poem and in a certain sense he has written his play independently of either though he has taken some of his effects from both it would however be clearly unreasonable to expect that this play should be considered on its own merits only and not to some degree with regard to its proportion to and relation with bulwers novel to which the murderer of daniel clarke owes his posthumous renown outside the records of the  annual register and the  newgato alendar thus considering it the question is naturally suggested why did not mr wills inspired by bulwers idea of a lonely student possessed by remorse and fear out of which he is only partially beguiled by love and whose fate comes up with him just as he is about to marry a beautiful girl refer to bulwers view of how the subject ought to be treated in a dramatic instead of merely adopting it in its romantic form  he had bulwers own exposition of his notions on this point and he had the  fragment of the drama which bulwer commenced but did not proceed with and they make it clear that the novelist perceived and appreciated the nature and uxtent of the difference between the romantic and the dramatic capabilities of the story of crime and misery which had strongly fascinated his imagination bulwer turned the drama into a romance mr wills has turned the romance into a drama in the face of the novelists careful demonstration of the vital distinction in fact the antagonism between the two the novel takes up the murderers life at the point where it is most adapted for description that is for the reverse of dramatic treatment but the  fragment takes it up at the point at which the dramatic element is in its full force that is when motive is most powerful and action most prompt the  fragment might never have been fashioned into a good play but any play founded upon the life of  eugene aram which departs entirely from the method of the fragment must necessarily fail to be a good play in this instance the dramatic instinct has deserted m1r wills and he supposes the existence of a state of consciousness on the part of the audience such as the novelist has it in his power to iniduce by description digression or suggestion but which it is the dramatists business to create we cannot imagine shakespeare bringing the guilty queen on in the first act in macbeth bemoaning herself and washing her hands in her sleep and then the unravelling of motive and the description of the murder of duncan all done backward in a frenzied soliloquy but we follow the skulking figure of rudge the murderer of his master and of his fellowservant through all the pitiful stress of his dastard fear and his remorse which is never repentance until the author of  barnaby rudge discloses the secret with a sense that the exigencies of romance are adequately observed the failure of this dramatic instinct renders the first situation in mr willss play weak and incongruous why should the marriage of the only daughter of the vicar of an important parish with a village schoolmaster be a matter of rejoicing to everybody the vicar included  only it would appear in order that mr wills may not adopt the reasonable side of ibulwers story of a romantic girls love for a learned recluse not divided from her by a hopeless inequality of station while he equally with lbulwer does depart from the fact that euene aram had a wife living at the time of his detection in the revelation to his wife of arams crimeits motive and its perpetration having been made plain to the audience by a prologuethere would have teen an opportunity for the exhibition of true dramatic power in both author and actor an opportunity far more worthy than the declamatory incoherent selfaccusation at the feet of a bewildered girl to whom her moody lover has ever been a problem imposed upon mr irving in a scene impressive indeed demanding the utmost exercise of the actors peculiar skill but which elicits no spontaneous response apart from the tribute of admiration due to that skill because it is untrue to the facts to nature and to the previous indications of the piece in the soliloquy which follows the entrance of eugene aram it is certainly implied to the audience that the remorseful man is in love for the first time in his dark and mysterious life and one of the strongest points of analogy between mr willss play and bulwers romance consists in the conviction entertained by ruth meadows that she is eugenes first love just as a similar conviction delights and satisfies the sentimental madeleine lester of the novel but this theory maintained to the end in the one instance is abandoned in the other in a fashion which is destructive to the ideal of the murderers character as it is put forth in the first scenes it is difficult to believe that the play was written otherwise than piecemeal that the story of the motive for the murder of clarkewhich is neither that imagined by bulwer nor that which really actuated eugene aramwas not concocted for the purposes of the concluding scene so discordant is it with all that precedes it the defect of the play as a composition is the absence of any indication of a previously or actually existing passion in the man to whose past so terrible a history attaches which can explain or account for that history like bulwer mr wills rejects the view of eugene aram as a common thief and assassin but he displays nothing like equal skill in the substitution of a supposed motive for the real one bulwer went as near to the palliation of the murder committed by the schoolmaster as the ingenious representation of an idee fire a devouring passion for learning and the revolt of a gloomy morbidly selfconscious mind against the poverty which fettered all its movements could enable him to go in the  fragment as well as in the novel but mr wills following neither has failed to explain the eugene aram who comes upon the scene a melancholy man indeed but whose melancholy according to his own subsequent explanation of its cause would have barred the approaches of the passion of love that ilulwers eugene aram should have possessed an emancipating angel in madeleine lester is intelligiblehis crime had nothing to do with a woman that mr willss eugene aram should have fallen in love with the parsons daughter is inconceivable his crime having been inspired by the base deception of a woman and his remorse kept alive if he could have forgotten the woman and the crime well and good but he never does forget and the discord makes the whole thing unreal the want of dramatic proportion affects the other characters as well they have no individuality apart from their relation to eugene aram parson meadows is a singularly credulous not to say silly old gentleman with an accommodating indifference to social distinctions which we are inclined to believe was less common in england in the last century than it is in this and so deficient in perception that he could hardly claim with hamlet to know a hawk from a handsaw considering the facility with which he invites houseman one of the most ruffianly ruffians ever produced upon any stage to join the family party on the day before the wedding of his daughter dr primrose is a smart man compared with mr willss parson who has a number of pretty speeches to deliver about arams gentleness and tendt ress about his putting the worm in his path into a place of safety releasing imprisoned birds and winning his pupils hearts they are very pretty speeches indeed there is a good deal of prettiness in the play and a little real poetrybut the gentleness and tenderness of eugene aram have to be taken for granted he is from first to last under the absolute dominion of remorse his love is more full of self pity than of passion his self absorption does not yield to the wouldbe joyous influence of the occasion while yet there is nothing to excite the ever latent fear in his breast it is difficult by the way to conceive a more inconvenient fatherinlaw elect than mr meadows for a man whose dread of the mere passing presence of a  stranger  is so great that the mention of the arrival of such a person suffices to distract his attention from the pretty protestations of his bride on the eve of their wedding here again mr wills while adhering to a portion of bulwers conception of the situation neglects a material constituent in it the murderer in the romance knows who it is who is lurking about threatening to reveal his secret to boland lester but the murderer in the play displays terror at the extremely natural occurrence that it stranger has introduced himself to the notice of the vicar of knaresborough and yet he is wholly unprepared to find that the stranger is houseman his former accomplice again in the story of the dreaded and threatened exposure mr wills is in accord to a certain extent with bulwer but not far enough bulwers aram is a comparatively rich man at all eventshe is in a position to make the coarser villains scheme of clhantage feasible but the village schicolmaster who is going to marry the parsons daughter has no money to be bullied out of and is a likelier subject for the tactics of conciliation which has an eye to the future the concluding scenes which are unlike either the novel or the facts are constructed entirely with regard to the characteristics of mr irvings acting they are made for him as exclusively as his costume is made for him and they become him as well this is in this particular case interesting but it is not drama and in the end we believe it is a system which will be found to be as injurious to the actor as it is unjust to the dramatist it is the most infallible method of encouraging mannerism that could be pursued not mannerism in the higher sense of characteristic conception and rendering but the mannerism which is as often as not mere affectation and which lends itself readily to the purposes of burlesque it dispenses the principal actor in a liece from the finer kind of observation while it taxes his energies in one direction it leaves a whole set of faculties without demand upon them in another it tends to drive him into exaggeration on the one hand and on the other into the carelessness which comes from the absence of comparison and by placing every one else at a disadvantage it deprives him of legitimate assistance pieces made to order in this way are to true dramatic writing just what zuccheros pictures were to really artistic portrait painting in the present instance to only one person besides eugene aram is any interest even supposed to attach it is to ruth meadows his betrothed a part by no means illplayed by miss isabel bateman but hopelessly ineffective because endowed with no vitality except that of the circumstances inconsistent and unnatural because ruth is merely a reflet of eugene arams moods and characteristics bulwer took care to establish an interest in his readers minds for madeleine lester to depict her in strongly individual colours and to sketch her life and associates before he plunged her into the deadly peril of love for an undetected criminal to tell all about her enthusiasm her lofty visionary mind and the studentfancies she holds as faith but that a parsons daughter whom we meet as an ingenue presiding over a village choir lauded by her gardener as the household angel a being of white muslin blue ribbons poetry and posies should mingle the most innocent and orthodox piety with a declaration that if eugene arams hand were even stained with crime she would still regard him with the passionate worship which he has inspired is unnatural and unpleasant not only or chiefly because the sentiment is at variance with every principle on which her life has been trained with every other to which she gives expression but because there is no reason for its suggestion except the authors absorption in eugene arams supposed state of mind and his inability to shift himself to that of any other person however comparatively important in the drama so as to give consistency or vitality to the other characters it is no wonder that miss isabel bateman is artificial and constrained all through she has a most unmanageable lover to deal with one so totally selfengrossed that she is made to appear as she must feel an interruption whenever she is not merely a chorus and the fact is that the only real chance she gets of producing any effect of signifticance is during the brief interval when eugene aram is off the stage in his case also by far the most effective scene is that in which he is quite alone when in the churchyard the murderer in his unbearable agony of remorse makes abject confession to heaven the dramatist puts forth the best that is in him the sense of interruption and incompleteness is lost in that solemn scene full of breathless interest the solitude of the guilty soul isolated by its incommunicable grief is broken by the only commune which has no discord in it and for the first time the legitimate condition for the employment of crime as a motive of dramatic action the inspiring of pity and of fear is fully attained mr henry irvings acting in the character of eugene aram is quite up to public expectation he plays the part with wonderful minuteness elaboration of detail and variety of expression considering the limited range of the emotion and its terrible profundity the slight demand for subtlety in the earlier scenes because every one is perfectly willing to be deceived and the complete surrender of the later scenes in which the presence of houseman in one and that of iruth meadows in another is of no practical account he is unreasonably suspicious and uneasy and preoccupied all through the first scene with ruth but that is the fault of the text he has to interpret  the fine touches in the interpretation the despairing glance over the girls head as it lies on his breast the vague absent smile and the lapse into thought far away from her even while the love words are on his lips and the caressing hands are touching her the writhing under the torture of praise and love in the address from his pupils as it is inflicted by the lips of his bride the shrinking from the pretty details of the weddingall these are his own in the agony and terror of detection in the morbid dread of the poor remains of the man he has slain in his dreadful question to houseman  diditstir  throughout the whole of the concluding scenes mr irving displays increasing power and intensity of expression but the situations are unduly prolonged and in the concluding scene in the churchyard he has too much ground to cover it is impossible to follow him through the contortions of that final agony without feeling that physical effort has too much place in it that it is suffered to divide the attention of the audience with the terrible mental struggle destined to end in utter defeat and death in a proportion which injures the effect of the whole in that one instance only the play is better than the interpretation the words are faultless the action is overdone many other passages of considerable beauty adorn mr willss play but they do not suffice to rescue it from the sentence of mediocrity as a dramatic composition that it is very much better than many plays with which the public have been satisfied of late years is not weighty evidence in favour of either the play or the public but we are far from accepting  eugene aram as the best that mr wills can do the author of  medea and the man o airlie and even of charles the first with all its faults as a drama ought to produce lieces which certain actors should aspire to perform not only pieces which aspire to be percormed by certain actors in the inversion of the roles of

8fc if c pp45 we are adherents to the old doc trines of hume and paley that the constitution of the house of com mons is best as it is because that con stitution is in our opinions the only one which can be permanent nor do we see any thing in the reasoning for parliamentary reform which is not derived from pure theory the fact appears to be this in the counties cities or towns where the property lies in one or two or very few rich per sons the members returned are com monly ministerial but in places where the property is much divided the refresentatives are mostly in opposition toperty will command influence and the augmentation of voters where the wealth of the place is in few hands would probably have no other than the present result and elsewhere surely no advantage would be gained by the other party if the electors for westminster were doubled or tripled as the influence of property cannot be destroyed but by military despotism we do not see what important change would ensue unless there were also changes in the state of the property men will vote according to their inte rests and the proprietor of old sarum whether the burgesses were ten or a hundred or a thousand if he owned the whole or a majority of them would return the member by means of such large proprietors the crown is alone enabled to maintain its proper weight in the constitution and as one ostensible pretence of parliamentary reform is to ease the people of taxation by diminish ing the national debt every advance in that project would more and more throw the great capitalists upon landed sroperty and augment the very inuence which it is the professed object of parliamentary reform to reduce in short we consider it purely in an impartial abstract view as a bubble and one which must ever be so unless froperty be previously subdivided our imits do not permit us to give other very cogent proofs that the idea is and must be of no other result and so far from ministers having advanced the in fluence of the crown by extravagance as has been pretended the more the national debt is increased the more their influence in parliament dimi nishes because the landed property is not absorbed and monopolised by the capitalists mr bick nell a moderate respect able and gentlemanly writer wishes to prevent bribery in any possible brm but can he suppress expectancy and indirect modes of conferring

trevlyn hold or squire trtvlyrcs heir new novels bythe author of  east lynne 3 vols tinsley brotherstrevlyn hold is more interesting and less melodramatio than most of mrs woods later works there is nothing startling about it not even a ghost she has succeeded in working out a good story full of action and plot without the aid of any very gross crime there is not a single murder worthy of the name not a robbery commonly so called not a forgery not a divorce case and only a very mild commonplace trial before a few county magistrates and yet strange to say in spite of this forbearance mrs woods new novel is more exciting than any she has produced since her first success in east lynne this is partly owing to her having refrained for once from imparting to her readers any lessons in teetotalism or political economy so that the story runs its course uninterruptedly and is full of interest from beginning to end another marked improvement in trevlyn hold is that there is more delicacy of touch in the delineation of the characters more light and shade than is usual with this author there aresome good points to be found even in members of the unpopular family and we are led to suppose that some of the persecuted race are liable to occasional failings of temper which render them infinitely more lifelike and true to nature than her heroes usually are mrs wood true to herself however is far from neglecting her favourite theory of retribution villany she believes brings its own reward even in this world innocence is sure to triumph sooner or later whether this is always the case in real life we do not feel so confident but in the world of fiction where the author has an unlimited power of bestowing rewards and punishments it would be hard if the wicked were to go scatbless and if the virtuous failed to obtain their rights at the end of the third volume the story of  squire trevlyns heir is as follows the old squire dies leaving one single daughter and two married daughters to succeed to his estates of his two sons one has run away in early youth and is supposed to have died abroad the other always a delicate invalid has died of consumption also abroad leaving a wife and an infant daughter but the squire never knows for it is fraudulently kept from him that joes widow has given birth to a posthumous son who should of course be heir to trevlyn hold the squire is a passionate vindictive old gentleman and tyrannical withal he is angry with his eldest daughter for having married tom ryle the gentleman farmer and he is angry with his son joe for having married the clergymans daughter and it is not difficult to persuade him to leave his property which is not entailed to the other married daughter mrs james chattaway and her children james chattaway has for years established himself at  the hold as confidential adviser and manager of the estates and by persuading or bribing the unmarried daughter to aid him in keeping the secret mr chattaway succeeds in concealing the birth of joes son and securing the inheritance for himself after his own sons rupert and joseph the squire accordingly bequeaths the hold to his second daughter mrs chattawaythus cutting off all hope for though children of his son joe and of his eldest daughter mrs ryle at the time the story opens james chattaway has been for born years in possession of trevlyn hold and his son cris lords it over his cousins bravely as the young squire should do mrs kyle is bitterly aggrieved that her son trevlyn kyle is deprived of his lawful rights and the neighbours generally regard the chattaways as usurpers and interlopers and feel convinced that rupert trevlyn poor joes orphan boy should be if all had their rights the master of trevlyn hold mr chattaway has received into his family joes children for their widowed mother is also dead and a pleasant life rupert and maud trevlyn have of it there mrs chattaway a weakminded helpless woraau does her best for them but she is as much afraid of her husband as they are and she can do but little to help them maud is made governess to the younger chattaways and rupert is honoured with the office of clerk at some mining works on the estate cris and octave chattaway taking good care meanwhile that they shall not be spoilt by any foolish overindulgence from softhearted mrs chattaway aunt diana tbe unmarried miss trevlyn who also resides at the holl is anxious that no gross injustice or cruelty should be perpetrated and so far as she is concerned administers justice to all her nephews and nieces with an even hand the hero of the tale is george ryle mrs ryles stepson a thoroughly upright conscientious young man who with the most unselfish motives manages trevlyn farm for his stepmother and halfbrother pays off all chittaways unjust claims upon them and is ready to retire in his brothers favour the moment he is required to do so of course george ryle falls in love with maud trevlyn and though persecuted with attentions from octave chattaway never swerves from his allegiance to the oppressed governess and equally of course is handsomely rewarded at last rupert trevlyn is however the bestdeveloped character in the book and in his wrongs and sufferings the interest chiefly centres worn out by a long train of daily insults from his uncle and cousins and stung to madness by a horsewhipping unjustly administered for some trifling offence rupert seizing a burning torch plunges it into a hayrick which stands temptingly close at hand and thereby ruins all his hopes of any mercy from the avaricious chattawaywe will not here relate the end of the story for it would forestall the pleasure of reading the book itself assurance may be given that though cruel chattaways are defeated in the most surprising and unexpected manner and that  the hold  becomes the property of its rightful owner all in good time there are some very welldepicted scenes scattered about the three volumes the accident at the mine and the burning of the ricky ard the death of farmer ryle and the advent of the mysterious stranger with the red umbrella are all excellent some of the characters too are original and well contrasted one with the other gentle mrs chattaway and her strongminded bisters airs ryle and diana trevlyn are good so are nora the bustling housekeeper at the farm and ann canham the weakeyed but worthy charwoman at the lodge take it all in all  trevlyn hold is a successful novel and will be more popular than many of its predecessors though perhaps it is not up to the standard of east lynne which seems to be still the work of this prolific author,englishfiction_contra
fiction thorley weir by e f benson smith elder and co 6s there is never any question about the interest of t mr e f bensons stories they invariably claim if possible an uninterrupted attention they have however generally one improbable character or one who behaves rather improbably in certain situations here we have craddock a cool calculating man who makes a fine income by employing his artistic sense and knowledge in shady waysprincipally by obtaining from promising young authors and painters an option on their work for three years ahead posing meanwhile as a generous patron by giving them cheques which seem handsome to the inexperienced youths but which are trivial compared with what they might have earned had their subsequent plays and pictures been in the open market craddock is very cleverly drawn but for such a capable man of the world he collapses quite too easily when cornered and detected in some underhand dealings however the story is undoubtedly interesting and worthy of all the praise which it will surely obtain the plot it will be seen is original and the river scenes in which the love affair of the young artist is set are in mr bensons best vein several of the characters touch almost overstep the line of comedy and come perilously near the realm of farce but are saved just in time the relations of the artist and his charming mother are excellently shown and form one of the most pleasing features of a capital novel,englishfiction_contra
i strictly tied up 3 vols hurst and blackett       11  evidently by an irishman this novel is most iulln written though the story is often forgotten by the author or allowed to drag while he dashes gaily along saying what he has to say mrs foulis a young heiress and the wife of a month is left a widow at seventeen and at thirtyfour finds herself mother of a grownup daughter on whom she believes her money to be strictly tied up the daughter cold and cunning yet stupid allows her self to be run away with by a scheming patchedup baronet of fiftyeight who imagines he is winning a rich prize and little thinks that his son is meanwhile making love to the widow how the latter coy and prim and sweet distressed at the ingratitude and deceit of her daughter and alone and lonely allows herself to be won by the revising barrister and how after the marriage ceremony they find out that the money is only tied up on the daughter in default of a male heir and how they acquaint the scheming baronet and his sulky bride of this and how they settle money on their belongings all round and are at last rewarded by the birth of a son to inherit the tiedup money is all most amusingly told the sketch of lady foulisville and her repeated failures is well drawn and it seems almost unconsciously on the authors part is exceedingly pathetic the irish scenes are perhaps the best things in the book and the account of the embassy to nicholas macswinny the miller is told with vigour and humour with a little more story and conversation the conversations are few and many of them disappointing this would have been an excellent novel as it is the padding is so bright and fresh that one forgets to be angry with the author for not getting on fast enough,englishfiction_contra

r 1 ghetto tragedies by i zangwill mcclure co it is a sincere pleasure to meet another of mr zangwills books about the jews he again showswhat indeed was evident in 4 the children of the ghetto that in this subject he has found his true sphere and that instead of being merely a purveyor of amusing stories and good jokes he is also an artist and the art displayed here is of a very high orderthe art of revealing he beauty inherent in what at first sight is merely ugly or commonplace for mr zangwills polish jews are certainly not obviously beautiful they might almost be called repulsive in some aspects they have associations of squalor and unintelligent superstition which it is difficult to overcome ana indeed mr zangwill does not attempt to overcome them he presents them in all their native ugliness he glosses over nothing he hides nothing and yet he adds just the touch of beauty which raises the commonplace into a fitting subject for art he knows just where to introduce  the droppings of warm tears and the touches of things human till they rise to touch the spheres the most wonderful story of these four is that entitled the sabbath breaker it is about a horrible old polish woman dying in hospital she has been a nuisance to all about her with her querulous exactions but just as she is dying she falls into a torpor when she lives over again the one great episode of her life the episode which makes her human and glorifies her otherwise miserable existence the other really excellent story is 4 the diary of a meshumad of which the chief interest lies in the tenacity of racefeeling displayed even in a jewish renegade the first story is the weakest although the weird likeness of the dwarf to satan is an effective dramatic touch  novel notes ghetto tragedies by i zangwill mcclure as an interpreter of the jew to the gentile at once a naturalist painter of hebrew speech and manners and a revealer of hebrew ideals mr zangwill is already known in this field he has a magnificent opportunity and few rivals the life of modem jews even in london where they are more absorbed in the population than anywhere else has recesses and sanctuaries which few gentiles guess not only in the east end among the poor and the wretched are their religion and ritual a great fact but behind the complacent comfort of jewish villadom there lingers still a wealth of eastern ceremony and sentiment a picturesqueness of custom out of which the spirit has not all died and a tenacity of racial habit without parallel in a shifting age modem hebrew life presents the rare spectacle of a cease less struggle for money which is quite unable to kill the religious and the poetical sentiments mammon is not wholly victor it is not however with the judaism of bayswater that mr zangwill deals here but of the east end and of foreign countries a few of his pages almost convince us that his race has found a masterly interpreter in mr zangwill and the rest is pure disappointment of the four stories  satan makatrig  the diary of a meshumad  incurable and the sabbath breaker the second and third deserve high praise and now and again in al of them the inner life of judaism its exalted moments its fervid domestic affections the significance of its symbols the pathos of its memories are depicted in a way for which we have only the most sympathetic admira tion the religious ecstasy of rivkoly in the first story the early racial instincts of the apostate in the secondinstincts triumphing over all the influences and the selfinterest of his later lifethe painful adherence to every possible letter of the law even in its heroic breach in  the sabbath breaker are described with quiet force but here hesitation comes in in the first place he has not proved that he can write a story rather he has proved that he can markedly fail satan makatrig  is the most ambitious from a narrative point of view but with much good detail it is a jumble of improbabilities a heap of uncalled for exaggerations it is a story of neither this world nor another neither natural nor supernatural striving after effect yet ineffective a study in religious fanaticism and of blasphemous mania it needed sobriety of treatment for want of which it has little coherence and carries no conviction it is difficult at first to say wherein lies mr zangwills defect but we steal upon it in  incurable this sketch of life in an eastend refuge has in it an incident very striking and truly pathetic sarah the bedridden paralytic has a faithless husband she taxes him with his neglect and desertion and he does not deny it but excuses himself with shuffling whining cowardice his wife is not without a feeling of bitter indignation at her luckless fate and scorn for his weakness but she will not have him live in sin and so she commands him to bring her the gettthe voluntary acceptance of which by the wife annuls a marriage the episode is really sublime but it is nearly spoilt by the accessories by the heaping up of the agony of the surroundings by a struggle for effect which overreaches itself the second story which is more reflective than narrative is artistically far better it is the diary of a russian jew who became an apostate in his youth married a christian and brought up his son paul in the christian faith but in the afternoon of his life he finds that the old belief is strong in him still that old memories are dearer and nearer to him than any of the advantages of his apostasy than the thought of his dead wife dearer than anything save paul and paul ignorant of his origin is an orthodox bigot an inciter of antisemitic riots and cruelty the four tragedies are all remarkable full of tender statement and wrapped about by picturesque circumstance but mr zangwill is not yet an artist his earlier literary sins have left him an unfortunate legacy no one can write bachelors clubs and  oid maids clubs with impunity the popular success of such attempts is dearly bought by any one who aims at literature and finds his hand subdued to the baser stuff it has worked in mr zangwill is by nature an idealist he is an idealist who went astray for a time but he is on the right track now,englishfiction_contra

cargoes and a hint of a promise that mr jacobs may one day write a good novel though we are far from suggesting that we are tired of his excellent fooling the crew of the seamew are the most delightful of companions and the king of them all is that hopeful boy henry henry must not be lost sight of he should still serve both mr jacobs and us on many future occasions and something is owing

brown mans servant quite successful as a horror  the skippers wooing by w w jacobs c a pearson limited from the point of view of pure art  the brown mans servant which is the second and shorter of the two stories in mr jacobss volume makes the greater claim it has a pretty touch on the uncanny the characters are a jew pawnbroker and a burmese the brown manwho wants a diamond which the jew has got into his clutches and refuses to surrender this is how the mysterious brown man is introduced 44 the cat still dozing became aware of a strong strange odour in a lazy fashion it opened one eye and discovered that an old shrivelled up little man with a brown face was standing by the counter it watched him lazily but warily out of a halfclosed eye and then finding that he appeared to be quite harmless closed it again the intruder was not an impatient type of customer he stood for some time gazing round him then a thought struck him and he approached the cat and stroked it with a masterly hand never in the course of its life had the animal met suoh a born stroker every touch was a caress and a gentle thrum thrum rose from its interior in response something went wrong with the stroker he hurt the cat started up suddenly and jumped behind the counter the dark gentleman smiled an evil smile and after waiting a little longer tapped on the counter the brown man threatened to send a devil to work his revenge that evening the cat goes apparently mad and the jew stumbles over its dead body on his way to bed this is the prelude to a terrible night i do not propose to give mr jacobs away by revealing tiie form whioh the devil takes but in the morning the jew shoots himself the story is told with considerable talent tersely and without irrelevancies its companion is cast in a lighter vein and smells of seawater ropes ends and shag tobacco the skipper of a small coasting schooner has fallen in love with a boardschool teacher she refuses to marry him until her longlost father is found the skipper proposes a reward to his crew and the consequent adventures of sam dick the cook and the boy henry are to my mind immensely diverting henry above all in prosperity or adversity is a fund of joy generally the laugh is on henrys side but when the gymnasium mistress carried him out of the garden with stolen apples rolling from his pocket the tables were turned for he met the cook outside here is a sample of henrys wit and humour 44 they had got down to the river again and he hesitated in front of a small beershop whose halfopen door and sanded floor offered a standing invitation to passersby 4 could you do a bottle o gingerbeer  inquired the mate attracted in his turn 4 no said henry shortly 41 couldnt i dont mind having what youre going to have the mate

his face and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand regarded the offender closely  so long as it dont turn it red i dont mind he said patiently  and i dont think as ow your swipes would hurt anythin the skipper11 wooing is extravaganza throughout but it shows mr jacobs to be possessed of real humour and humour of a more humorous sort than certain humorists have lately vouchsafed to us taken together the two stories quite sustain the high promise of many cargoes  r the skippers wooing and the brown mans  servant by w w jacobs pearson  co i we do not remember any previous attempt to exploit the language and modes of thought of the east coast smacksmen the rather farcical but honest and successful wooing of capt wilson of the seamew is wholesome and pleasant reading in spite of the occasional failures of his devoted crew of three men and a boy to second his endeavours these simple mariners expose themselves to many adventures and frequent lapses from such cardinal virtues as truthtelling and sobriety in their quest for the missing parent of the fair annis whose hand is to be the reward of success it is possible to read these studies in humble life without the sadness and loathing which attend other realistic descriptions of latterday social phenomena  the brown mans servant is a short and vivid description of a recondite and horrible murder thrown in apparently as a

some sheaves of corn  anl when he took oil his hat to ask a blessing on the repast his thick black hair clustering round his sunburnt temples and wiped with his sleeve the healthy perspiration from his brow and looked fondly and gratefully in his barbaras face as he took the bread and milk from her hands i thought i never saw a handsomer rustic pair they ate their meal with a pleasant countenance and did not discourage the joke and jeer of rustic fun that went round among the reapers and as the latter rose to return to their work i saw a tear steal down barbaras cheek as with some strange emotion she gazed upon her husband  while when the reapers had gone he placet his arm kindly round her waist as il to acknowledge in love and kindness that this was a moment of real happiness soon however does it vanish  the lady is seduced from her husband and child and for a season leads a life of dishonour and here is the contrast   james johnston went about the cauld rigs ofthe mailing a perfect object of brokendown manhood suffering and despondency th only consolation he appeared to take in life was in the nursing and tending of his little laugh ter but providence in its mystery seemed to have set its mark upon him for even this last tie to the world was threatened next to be torn out of his shattered heart the winter time had set in cauld and grim and a lonely blackness seemed to brood over the ntlhbourhood of leafless carloghie when one dark night towards the middle watches a solitary figure of a woman came stealing towards the farmhouse of reen braes she was dressed richly for a pedestrian yet there was in her appearance and manner au air of wild and rockless dilapidation she sought the window where she saw a light burning i need not say this was the once handsome and proud lady barbara of carloghie with hesitating steps and rising emotion she drew near to the little window there was no screen and she looked in as well as her blinded eyes would allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is far away with them that never loved her as i have done  and now thou art her last saddest remembrancer and cold deaths creeping up to thy young heartand 1 am a bereft and brokenhearted man he stopped suddenly choked by his sorrow and thought he heard a noise without it was barbara groping agitatedly for the latch of the door the sounds were low but became shaip and abrupt and the door moved as if the walking spirit of death sought hasty admission in another instant the figure of a female wanderer stood before him and the pale and haggard countenance of bis own barbara appeared by thc dim light ofthe small lamp more like a deadly ghost than a living being k it is indeed barbara herself she said after gazing ionland sadly in his altered countenance come to lay her head beneath your feet fames johnston if yell only let me acknowledge i ve been your ruin and kiss my bonnie bairn before she dies  the lord prepare me for this trial he said staggering back to a seat  babby is it you come to mo

husband  yell no put nie out at this door till ny puir bairn wins to her last rest  till the breaths out ol marys body said james  ye may sit there and greet by her side but yeve done us bitter wrong lady babby as ye truly say and another night ye shall never abide under my roof the two parents sat and watched the dying child and at times between their sobs ol sorrow stole a nameless look at each others faces at length in the darkest hour that comes before the break of the morning the pretty bairn gasped its last and was relieved from the troubles of an uncertain world nothing was saidnothing could be spoken as the women that waited without came iu to compose the limbs of the child  its over now and my deeds done said lady barbara rising  it is not fit that i should sit longer in an honest mans house with a steady stop she walked tow ards the door and ere the light of morning lind opened out fairly upon the breaking sky her figure had vanished beyond the fields of the farm and no one inquired whither she went     the fairly kirkyard where mary johnston was buried is pleasantly situated a little above the rtiar water whore the bridge crosses off towards carloghie castle on the night after the funeral james johnston was a  restless mau  and when his frit nils looked in  his pale face and wandering eye they shook their heads and said that it would be well if nothing fearful should happen when the darkness came on however he found himself unable to stay in his house and made his way towards the kirkyard to try to get relief by indulging his sorrow oer his daughters grave it was dark as pitch by the time he entered the little stile and groping among the tomb stones he could not readily find the spot where his bairn lay isle had just found the green mould and the loose sods when seating himself down upon a broad stone lie saw something move between himself and the starless sky but quite near on the oilier side of the grave  who is there  he called out with some terror  is there any ono watching in this dreary kirkyard that can have griefs to bear equal to mine  k deeper deeper and sadder far janies johnston  said i faint womans voice  for the grief of guilt

monthly review of literature domestic and foreign gaston de blndeille or the court of mharu iii keeping festival in ardxen a rolwe by mrs raddiffa 1826 in the memoir of mrs radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes there is so comprehensive and altogether so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy ite breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated departed spirits alas alas gaston de blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to the writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department now we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature the primary ones themselves i love hate ambition jealousy avarice have f their entrances and exits inthe breast but  c these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so i large a space in the basis of all characters c that they are usually and readily excitable ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production and a after even the fullest development require li but a very brief suspension to recruit their d forces but with the lesser and secondary t and artificial tastes those associations which ti are no more than the reaction of some si individuals peculiar constitution and talents t upon the taste of the age when these have 1 swayed the public mind for a while and v run their epidemic couse are felt no more a for a long a

a murderer to justice these worthy persons however one and all are far more afraid of the secular than the spiritual arm and not one of them has virtue or nerve to boldly help the demon in his persecution of a royal favourite the old plea of magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt afforded by the spectre here was a dilemma for the authoress and she found no escpefor like the egyptians of old whatever ghost did was supposed imitable by man but the end must come sooner or later and the accused lords sudden death and subsequent reappearance and confession of the crime to his royal master bring the longresisting mind of the king to conviction who believes at last with about as

new novels in summer shade by mary e mann 3 vols henry  co by a judicious use of padding miss mann has managed to expand into three volumes a story which might well have been told in one to put it plainly the story which undeniably has some good points about it drags dreadfully in the telling the central idea of claudes gradual conversion from contempt to love for mary burn is well conceived and the characters of claudes brother the bigoted clergyman of the heroines father and mother and of the heroine herself are well drawn but claude himself is unpleasant and it is difficult to understand how mary could ever have become so devoted to him as she is besides the book would be immensely improved if it ended with the lovers reconciliation after their first quarrel the second appears to be unnecessary and the whole history of the sisters adventure in london is sufficiently improbable altogether it is a depressing book with its narrowminded earson and his silly wife the pompous ero the sodden millionaire the decayed father and mother and the loutish lover still much is to be forgiven in a novel like this where the characters are not mere puppets but living beings even if we do not particularly care to know about their doings  in summer shade by mary e mann 3 vols henry and co  in summer shade is an excellent storyat least it is excellently told to some of the incidents we bear a grudge but in very few recent novels will there be found anything approaching its grasp of character and firmness of touch the writer looks at life with a very straight eye she certainly does not err on the side of idealising character and is not at all averse to laughing at those with whom she is on friendly terms the burnes householdthe weak amiable brokendown father the mother with her gypsy blood and her tawdry indolent ways and the family of beautiful daughters that have struggled up somehow without education or ready moneyare capitally drawn mary the heroine is a most faulty young woman she very often does not do her duty she is reckless and bold of speech and absolutely lacking in judgement where her own affairs are concerned she is also worldly but we understand the fascination exercised by her warm vitality her infatuation for the highbred poorsouled claude is as irritating as the things one hears of in real life and we hand mary over to her fate with a wrench of disappointment and mourn deeply the fate of the boorish honest bob and the generous spoilt and drunken spilling but if we differ from the authoress on some points of procedure she has our interest nevertheless all along her charaters are not made of ink and paper but of flesh and blood and her book has no flimsiness in either its thought or workmanship  in summer shade bv n1x l f 1nlann by i iolin lonii wc have learned to expect something pungent and stimulating in each of mrs manns took anl there can be no disappointment here though we have met another girl like her heroine mary in her pages before we dont complain ihe proud energetic uneltih creature struggling with alverse circumstances mande on one side better on the other worse by poverty is attractive enough to le welcome in many guises the picture of the outatelbows burner houselhold is matterlv and the sepirate portraits of tile rector and his 9tatelv brotlhlr claude are a11so excellent one grievance we have rnted her material the story could 1 no possibilitv have ben at once sincerely and uniformly agreeable but the unluck that dogs poor bob burton is too consisent we have the conviction that he was only killed in the end by the author that her favourite malv who with all her sterling qualities dearly loved fair externals might make a more brilliant mirriage with ee of convcleme,englishfiction_contra
fiction the queens tragedy by robert hugh benson pitman bs whatever else may be thought of father bensons latest historical novel no one will fail to find it fresh suggestive and interesting it keeps one asking is this true  was that wisely done  which was the right course in those circumstances such questionings mean that the book both holds attention and stimulates the mind to speak of the fiction as distinct from the history is really impossible for the two are interwoven like warp and woof so i address myself to the latter at once different as the judgments of protestants and catholics havecbeen about queen mary all agree that her reign closed in disappointment even before the worst had arrived father benson describes her feelings thus eighteen months ago she had been so happy the legate hd come with a splendour that promised great things england she thought had been restored to unity  her husband had been with her the babe had leapt in her wombthe dear babe that was to take up the government when she laid it down now it seemed as if all were a ghastly delusion the legate indeed still here but how powerless the heartshaking scene in westminster hall was no more than the rehearsing of a play that seemed postponed indefinitely her husband had disappeared into silence and the leap of the child was a thrill o a horrible disease    she had begun by hoping that    b restoring little by little the old worship the light of faith would be rekindled and her people had answered by attacking her priests mocking her religion and weaving sedition and heresy so inextricably together that it was impossible to punish the one without glorifying the other that is graphically as well as truly and sympathetically put in mary we see good intentions and mistaken policy tending to failure and failing while on the other side stands elizabeth worldly wise and unscrupulous knowing that she will win and winning in conclusion marys  star sets in gloom while the courtiers almost to a man slip away to worship the rising sun the main interest therefore and the chief problems are connected with mary but there is also a romantic element guy manton a cambridge master of arts is introduced an unconventional but interesting character whose development shows us what father benson thinks would have been the line taken during those troubles by one  of cathouc character he  is human of course and we see in him the degrading effect of the burnings having watched them he becomes aa he himself confesses a hard devil the obsession is admirably described with all the power of psychological and religious analysis in which father benson excels the narrative too here reaches a high degree of excellence man tons fidelity is put to a dramatic test and he wavers in the end however his better nature conquers but at was said before the true interest of the book lies in pure history and what of that history  to me it seems that in its main outlines it is unimpeachable the trials the successes and failures of the historical characters correspond with what actually took place for the rest the author has attained that degree of vrai semblance which is to be expected in a historical novel as we descend to details however we note the points at which differences of opinion will begin to assert themselves extremists will of course never be fully satisfied the admirers of foxe though they will find some things to their liking will not find enough believers in the inspiration of nicholas sander will not relish the way in which la ti mer and his confreres are praised  for as much as they did wisely enthusiasts for elizabeth and they are many will say that her portrait has been too darkly drawn but for my own part i think that a more notable error is one bearing hardly on queen mary as for elizabeth though no one would assert nowadays that se was truthful yet on the other hand no evidence is forthcoming to prove her such an unblushing hypocrite and traitor to her sister as she is here represented to have been this is true i think and yet father benson does not seem to me to have here exceeded the licence always allowed in a historical novel for as soon as he looked beyond marys reign and considered the contrast between elizabeths conduct before and after its terminationand perhaps pondered the wording of the coronation oath which she took in the hands of the old catholic prelates when she had fully decided on the measures for the overthrow of the old religionhe would feel fully justified in attributing to her as much as he has done of trickery and of faithlessness but however this may be i pass to a more important question is the mary tudor of this novel correct ly drawn from life  she is here a stupid woman conscious of her lack of wit and gaiety  unable to win love and affection and she is constantly losing herself in dreams her  mans voice  and prematurely aged appearance are insisted upon in and out of season i do not think that this is good portraiture it was perhaps tiue of her last days when the bloodletting and the other barbarities of contemporary leechcraft had brought her down to a shadow of her former self but this was not the woman who has made her mark on our history the dispatches of the ambassadors who came into actual contact with her show that she was active matteroffact well informed queenly and gifted with great insight into the men and matters that came under her notice it may be regretted that father bensons story concerns itself with the gloomy part of her reign exclusively even if otherwise faultless a picture so drawn is bound to be somewhat onesided of course there are also smaller points which might be discussed if space allowed he seems to me to be too hard upon philip too favourable to pole and to underestimate marys dislike of her halfsister which so good an authority as a venetian ambassador has called  hatred when elizabeths life was in the balance it was saved by philips intervention this would hardly fit in with some of fathers bensons most striking scenes whatever may be the objective truth about the points i have criticised it is clear first that they will not affect the the queens tragedyexcept in details which are nonessential and secondly that father benson has been so much on his guard against showing too much partiality for his coreligionists that when he does err it is generally to their disadvantage vuviau iv iuvii uiaauvauiac jh pollen sj  the queens tragedy  by robert hugh  benson sir isaac pitman  sons it is the novelist rather than the annalist who seems able to tell the truth about mary tudor that she was human and a woman is of service to her reputation as soon as we come close to her but proximity in this case can only be attained by imagination mr benson has not only come close to her  his mind has also glowed with sympathy for her she is in his pages a piteous woman the sport of extreme irony without peril to her devoutness and on her deathbed visited graciously by phantasmal children of heaven she is unintellectual she toils at embroidery  ridley and latimer are burnt and we see the candle lit that is not extinguished  yet for an hour or two we are loyal to mary because mr benson though no apologist is the voice of the pathos that is hers first love a passion for philip of spain in the breast of a woman of thirtyseven is tragedy in suspense from its commencement and the novelist makes her foolish heart flutter before us till we need the annalist to reduce the temperature of our pity there is no love story in the book except the queens instead of the usual fictitious wooing there is a deeply interesting study in manhood the subject being a fellow of cambridge who has left the university to become one of the queens gentlemen his aim is to be hard enough for his loyalty and the witnessing of torture he succeeds in spite of his tenderness for a friend in trouble a priest however is shrewd enough to divine that he is a man at wilful war with his own nature the writing at the end of the book is fine and grandiose  the queens tragedy by robert hugh benson 6s pitman one matter for congratulation is that mr benson has not made his new historical novel from the easy recipes that have been so popular of late years that they have grown tircsomelv conventional he has given us no lovely persecuted heroine and no dahinv and irresistible hero who is always arriving everywhere just in the nick of time to do something thrilling and saive the situation in a style that is admirably lucid and simple though one wvishes he would curb an inclination to colloquialism when one reads of people being horribly il horribly distressed or horribly startled i he teils the story of the dark and troubled reign of queen mlary as it was known to guy manton who served her alaestv as a gentleman usher he has drawn the pathetically unlovable character of mary clearly and with a very sympathetic insight and has woven the principal events of her life and the leading men of her age into a brilliant and fascinating romance that is the better and more intvresting fo being occasionally coloured ith something of partiality for her cause the closing sccne where the queen lies dying deserted and almost alone is a finrw inainecd and poignant piece of work alike for its characterisation

in the hope of winning her heart and her interest through these pretty parables alice listened always with wideeyed composure but one day when she had attended in spirit the touching scene of a little

the productions of this class now we have no attempt at fine writing no urgent and agonising appeal to our sensibilities no long exhaustive descriptions of natural scenery no dilettantism no theorising on art or its schools no fragments of ethical philosophy no metaphysical disquisitions this change is due in a reat measure to the influence of dickens and thackeray it has the poetical

tlte fortunes of nigel literary notices by the author of waverley sec  knifegrinder story  lord bless you i have none to tell sir poet ry of the a ntijacobin we have copied the motto with the title of this new production of the most fertile imagination ofthe day because it will spare a world of criticism as a tale the fortunes of nigel is a mere abortion and the author is so conscious of it that he has constructed an intro ductiou of no mean length to prepare us for the fact and to excuse itan introduction by the way which wa should have liked full as well if it had exhibited less ofthe equivocal slang of blackwood magazine we hare no objection to a little deportment en cavalier from an individual who cfttsctyqs of merit and the art of pleasing despises the cent ari the oimmonplaces of minor ci iticim but wd sunpttci be joktiworsdl sober contidb inatbcati tn be grimier and thal  the reaauoder of our brief observations will be less vafrracious whatever the defects of the story or the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political emergencies before his accession to the throne of england and the sole business of the story is to relate nis fortunes tn a journey to london to induce honest king james to repay it here we roust

at court aud it is this disgrace which supplies nearly the whole of the incident bearing in mind the authors account of hit manner of writing his unfavourable scottish portrait ture may be almost accidental but it is an accident from which our northern brethren are so genet all preserved we have hitherto concluded that its avoid ance might be safely left to instinct the story opens iu the very best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it is accounted for while physically accurate is certainly imaginatively disgusting contrary however to all anticipation abe does not prove to be the heroine and the lady who is so is after all only a diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public will be extremely

the deud secret new hovels by wilkie collins 2 vols cranbury  vanswo injustice will be done to mr colling if we trace the outline of his story before estimating its qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage becomes transparent in the opening chapters to all resent and to come therefore be it known that porthgenna tower with the premises adjoining is the tomb aud temple of n great family mystery captain and mrs trevertonthe former the lord of lands and monies the latter the daughter of an actress have there their local habitation  with them resides their only child rosamond mrs trevertons servant is called sarah leeson and in the first scene this woman is summoned to the deathbed of her mistress she is compelled by her domestic allegiance to write a letter to her master which the wife signs anil the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both be dont talk so dont talk so tellme quietlydear dear mother tell me quietly hush hush i am going to tell you she threatened me on her deathbed if i thwarted her she said she would come to me from the other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead

new issue of the dead secret in our literary summnzar last week  btit a niore detailed criticism is called for alike by the justly eminenit positwn of the author and the sterling character of the work itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a printers error,englishfiction_contra

  roman bitnet by georgia wood pang born houghton mifflin  co the country which lies over against canada bounded on the north by the st lawrence river and on the east by the adirondack mountains has furnished excellent materials for several american novels the mixture of races and especially the french strain among the people suggests good studies in characters of unfamiliar kinds the author of  roman biznet seems to be well acquainted with the land and people and she has made good use of her knowledge and experience biznets father with some blood of an old french family in him was a vagabond wanderer and a heavenborn musician and the authors interest in her work is mainly concentrated upon showing what would happen to the son of such a man brought up in more favourable circumstances the character is cleverly worked out and the only fault to be found with the book is that the author cultivates a taste for obscurity in phrase as well as in her method of narration it is a tribute to her skill to say that the reader finds himself drawn on to read the book through and to admit a little reluctantly perhaps at the end that the task is not so bad as he expected the following is a specimen of the sort of thing that impedes one in the course of the story and in all these dreams there was a jekyllhyde polarisation of two men distinct though folded up in each other like spheres united by that incomprehensible fourth dimension which mathematicians find amusing nonsense like this with a ridiculous affectation of learning is apt to turn a readers attention away from the real merits of a by no means incapable study of an interesting bit of character,englishfiction_contra

i land at last a novel in three books by i edmund yates author of broken to harness i running the gauntlet c chapman and hall in literature there is one thing that distinguishes alike the bad and good for although among signs of excellence it is one of the most indispensable it is one also that stupidity has in perfection and fails the more with while it is the very life of true success it is common only to good and bad writers in the middling writers it is usually wanting and the want of it is the main cause of their dreariness the answer to that riddle is individuality the worst writers are always distinctively absurd and are even relish able for the strong human flavour of that personal twist of character which makes their absurd notions and their peculiar ways of putting them good at least as amusing studies of real life at the other end of the literary scale the really good writer in energetic exercise of his own judgement and fancy is strongly himself and his individaality is clearly marked upon his thoughts and on his manner of expressing them between the good and bad lies the wide desert of the middling writers who are the servile herd of imitators constructing an

writer of the last century whose collection of popular stories volhs miirchen was edited by wieland his works ara classical but we must think them somewhat vulgar and cannot but applaud the omission of needless indelicacies in the translation of this very tale libussa is an excellent example of the spirit in which he took up old legends and of the halfmodern satirical garb he dressed them in two very powerful stories somewhat alike in their moral drift are the criminal from lost honour of schiller and the michael kohl haas of heinrich von kleist schillers would show that the extremes of guilt are never more surely engendered than by degrading punishments awarded to trivial offences von kleists that a man driven to desperation by the denial of justice may be made a criminal by his outraged sense of right this latter tale is unequal but we know few things in fact or fiction more masterly than the first half of it the scene where with forced calmness michael listens to the outrages committed on his servant is a piece of high tragedy the writer afterwards plunges into historical detail and somewhat soils his fancy with the thick dust of german chronicles but heinrich von kleist not to be confounded with an older author christian ewald von kleist was a remarkable person he belonged to what was called the romantic school bis works are edited by tieck at the beginning of the century and several of bis dramas particularly the kiithchen von heilbronn still keep the stage he bad a morbid aud sickly temperament and so much was this embittered by his hatred of the french invasion that he killed himself in 1811 when little more than thirty years of age two other stories in the collection may be named together as alike in tendency and belonging to the same class of vivid thoughtful satirical fantasy pieces these are the sandman of hoffman and the wonders in the spessart of karl von immermann we see in both the intention to laugh at the speculative and morbid tendencies of the germans and in both that nice and curious art which leaves the reader doubtful if the means employed have been fanciful or real there is no such natural form of supernaturalism as the german other nations at the best make clumsy work of it we should like to have quoted from the sandman which for the mingled satirical fantastical and horrible is a masterpiece of hoffmans brilliant genius but we can better detach one or two of the imaginative wonders of the spessart by immermann whose sudden death two or three years ago in the prime of his life and intellect was a

think of another dish to celebrate the departure for tomorrow that pie must be on the table m  your pleasure shall be done my lord replied the dwarf and retired but he went away uneasy for the day of his disgrace and misfortune had come he did not know now to prepare this pie isle went therefore to his chamber and wept over his fate when the goose mimi who was allowed to walk about came up and inquired the cause of his grief when she heard of the pie  dry your tears said she  this dish came often to my fathers tible and i know pretty well what is necessary for it you have only to take such and such things in certain quantities and should these not be all that are really necessary i trust that the taste of these gentlemen is not sulhciently refined to discover the deficiency  at these words the dwarf danced with joy blessed the day on which he had purchased the goose and set about making this queen of pies he first made a trial in miniature and lo the flavour was exquisite and the mastercook to whom he gave the small pie to taste praised once more his great skill l the following day he prepared the pie un a larger scale and after having garnished it with flowers sent it hot as it came from the oven to table after which he dressed in his best and went to the dining hall on entering he found the steward engaged in carving the pie and presentnig it on silver dishes to the duke and his guest the duke swallowed a large piece turned his eyes upward saying  ha  ha ha  jutlv is this called the queen of pies  but my dwarf is also a king of cooks is it not so my friend   his guest took a small morsel tasted it carefully and smiled somewhat scornfully and mysteriously the thing is made pretty well replied he pushing his plate away but it is not quite the soueraine as i well imagined  at this the duke frowned with indignation and turned red saying  you hound of a dwarf how dare you do this to your lord i i will have your big head cut off as a punishment for your bad cooking    1     ah my lord said tfte duart tremnung  xor neaveu s sake have compassion on me  i have made that dish indeed according to the proper receipt and am sure that nothing is wanting   tis a lie you knave replied the duke giving him a kick  tis a lie else my guest would not say there was something wanting i will have you yourself cut up and baked in a pie   have compassion on me  exclaimed the dwarf shuffling on his knees up to the prince and clasping his feet  tell me what is wanting to this pie and why it does not suit your palate  let me not die for a handful of meat or flour   this will not avail you my good nose replied the prince laughing  even yesterday i thought you would not be able to make this dish as well as my cook know there is wanting a herb called sneezewithpleasure which is not even known in this country without it this pie is insipid and your master will never eat it in such perfection as i do  at this the duke flew into a rage and cried with flashing eyes   i will eat it in perfection yet for i wear by my princely honour that by toinoirou i will either have the pie set before you such as you desire it or the head of this fellow shall he spiked on the gate of my palace go you hound i give vou once more twentyfour hours cried the duke now the herb wanted is the very herb that will disenchant the dwarf and being lucky enough to find it

the new humptydumpty by daniel chaucer lane 6s miss di pradella explained how you were taught to do the splits you stood upon two chairs and they were gradually drawn apart there is only one serious novelist whose mind is stored with such weighty secrets of the musichall as this this phrase a respectful reference to the empire ballet a savage contempt fortradespeople and familiar conversation concerning the forms of the roman catholic and the greek churches betray the identity of daniel chaucer the new humptydumpty in its fine detail and lucid statement of complex adventure is another stage in the development of a genius that is struggling from a youth spent in the subtlest impressionism to the most literal realism of treatment from the fifth queen to the panel in fact yet again it is an echo born the past when joseph conrad collaborated with another to write romance there was in that the same manly combat with fortune the same adoration for the noble highwayman but this is touched with the virtues of experience there is a fine mastery over events in the story of the splendid count sergius mihailovitch macdonald who for his ideal of benevolent despotism moves a counterrevolution in the republic of galizia and sets on the throne the boyking who would like to be a chauffeur and who having served his ideal is shot down on the night of victory because he once refused to admire the poetry of the elder dumas there is a new power in the gnomelike figure of the wretched little mr pett the socialist turned nietzschean tory and a wilder humour about the merry and disreputable miss di pradella with her passion for embroidered pillowslips of course daniel chaucer is always very childlike and one of the habits of childhood is to chuckle over jokes that it cannot explain so the savage satire with which he cudgels countess macdonald a horrible picture of what a wicked fabian would be like is sometimes incomprehensible the same combination of wit and obscurity that made one feel the force of the satire one was not permitted to understand was observable in high germany but the book as a whole is a complete reaction against daniel chaucers earlier manner one can remember the time when daniel chaucer committed the sin of henry james in every supersubtle sentence but that influence has gone the last pages which contain mrs petts description of the death of sergius mihailovitch belong to the manner of joseph conrad the weathercock veers to many winds but it is always the same weathercock and the individuality of daniel chaucer is always precious whatever wind it follows  the new humptydumpty by daniel chaucer 6s john lane the new humptydumpty is the young king of galizia whose people have rebelled set up a republic and made it necessary for him and his mean pompous old mother to escape out of it they settle down in england very much as a certain real king and his household are settled in exile amongst us at this time and presently a little group of plotters is gathered about them scheming and intriguing to replace the dispossessed monarch on his throne it is an amazing group including an american millionaire an english lady and his lordship her dissipated husband a fatuous chauffeur a lightcomedy actress a lady of lighter reputation still a bumptious cockney journalist and for leader of them all the russian count macdonalda wholly likeable and charming character the one utter idealist and fine spirit in the sordid selfsceking shoddy company the american millionaire helps to finance the adventure with a couple of millions on the understanding that he receives valuable mining concessions the english lady aldington and her husband contribute to the treasury because they own profitable tin mines in the country that the republic is governing the count who under the tuition of the egregious cockney journalist mr pett has been an anarchist and a socialist and squandered his fortune for the good of those causes has now taken up the kings cause on pure idealistic grounds and for no possible good to himself incidentally he is hampered with a very jealous wife the daughter of a london shopkeeper a girl he had married in his socialistic days he is further hampered by the american millionaires sentimental daughter falling in love with him and by falling in love himself with the unhappily married lady aldington wnrhich opens the door to some biting satire on our divorce laws as the whole story opens it to a satiric handling of modern methods of company promotion and to an ironic presentation of the grotesque realities that underlie the outward glory and dignity of kingship the characterisation is masterly and the satire of the book especially when it is concerned with the futile personality of the exiled king or that of a certain degenerate russian grand duke or that of the great little mr pett cuts home but it is all done with so light and whimsical a touch that even when it is most biting it is irresistibly amusing there is nothing cleverer or more entertaining among the new novels than this witty and brilliant story of how all the kings financiers and motley hangerson and that one delightful idealist went to work to put humpty dumpty together again  the new hmnptydumpty fiction by daniel chaucer john lane 6s  mr daniel chaucers work has the quality of a really good champagne it exhilarates and the general effect is that of a slight but quite pleasant intoxication no novelist eludes classification so successfully other writers are grave and gay in turns but mr chaucer is grave and gay at the same time he is at once a keen observer of contemporary movements a social satirist an explorer into the strange realms of phantasy and a purveyor of honest entertainment his style is marked by a distinction that lifts it to a very high level and his dialogue is a feast of delights one may perhaps take mr chaucer halfseriouy for it seems to us that it would be as great a mistake to see too little in his story as to see too much he chronicles with a certain eager avidity the lives of wellbred people of dissolute habits for the crankconsidered purely

the inheritor by e f benson 7s mud hutchinson blended in mr bensons new novel with characteristically natural descriptions of life at cambridge and in cornwall is a macabrec and melodramatic vein the earl scenes in which the ragging of undergraduates is described with sympathetic gusto and the commonroom conversation of the ions with perhaps too broad a touch of caricature hardly prepare the reader for what follows maurice crofts a young classical tutor is shiv and reserved and has made no real friendship in his life until he comes under the spell of steven gervase an undergraduate who for some apparently inexplicable reason has suddenly broken off his intimacy with the babe that  large stupid boy with just perception enough to guess that his schoolboy friendship with steven aas outworn and that another friendship just as absorbing but far more mature had arisen little by little the subtle influence of steven over maurice is unfolded but it is not until the two are holidaymaking at his lonely home in cornwall that steven is fully revealed as a strange kind of modern pagan with the hereditary curse of his family overshadowing him the reader must discover the climax for himself mr benson is too vigorous and adroit a storyteller not to give the semblance of reality to a somewhat unpleasant fantasyv but for ourselves eve prefer him as the unalloyed chronicler of ordinary lives,englishfiction_contra

belforest a tale of english country life new novels  by the author of mary powell c 2 vols bentley few writers have a better oyo than the author of  mary powell for discerning all that is picturesque in domestic ufo there are no characters perhaps in  belforest that may not be met with in our everyday experienceno incidents that would be considered very extraordinary even in the quiet circles of a country village but the figures are carefully drawn and the grouping is skilfully managed so that every portion of the picture is effective although it is composed of homely materials the author has evidently bestowed a good deal of thought on artistic subjects and she carries out with her pen the principles that she would recommend to those who work with the brush and palette her first rule we should imagine is to go to nature for models her second to select from among natural objects those which are pleasing and reject those which are rough and coarse her third to make an harmonious arrangement of the various tints and to throw a genial warmth over the whole there are many other kinds of art besides this but this is by no means a bad kind moreover it is essentially womanly and ladylike womanly because it is gentle and unassuming and does not aspire to heroics and ladylike because it is always refined and disdains to borrow  humours from the stable and pothouse the scene of  belforest is laid in a retired village untainted with suburban innovations but near enough to london to be within a walk of the dulwich gallery here wo find a young artist leonard antony lodging at the village postoffice and sketching everything in the neighbourhood whether living or inanimate nessy saffery the postmasters little daughterwho is esteemed a young lady of property on the strength of possessing an annuity of thirty poundsaspires to be initiated into the mysteries of art and it is ludicrous to contemplate the horror of the london zeuxis when asked to give lessons to the child of a village grocer nor is it less amusing to behold the blank dismay of miss saffery when leonard antony persuaded at last to undertake the charge sets her to draw straight lines on a piece of inillbuard though pour child has been fondly imagining that she is to start with a grund subject and a bright glow of colouring that she is to commence at once on a glorious work of art such as that on which mr antony himself is engaged the sudden fall to something little better than pothooks is terrible and nessys irrepressible anger nearly creates a fatal breach between the singular allies this quarrel between the clever and sarcastic young man and the demure little girl of thirteen makes a very amusing scene and it ends in a compromisemiss saffery being permitted to handle the brush a little while she graciously consents to use the chalk and millboard a good deal in avery short time she makes rapid progress the village magnates purchase her rustic sketches and even her instructor nods approval from his lofty pedestal however she is not intended to be a painterat least not in the present work perhaps the author intends to give us a continuation as nessy is not yet married or even in love and there are one or two other threads that might be taken up but  belforest has its own share of the romance of life apart from nessy several of the characters have a comic vein and the dialogue often causes a hearty laugh without ever becoming vulgar,englishfiction_contra
ftco old mens tales  the deformed and  the admirals daughter saunders and otley conduit street eloquence and passion are the characteristics of these volumes  hut the eloquence is employed only in the

1 kissing the rod a novel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth novel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends who were neither slow nor cold in recognising the merits of his earlier stories and who sincerely regret the imperfections of his present book he clearly stands in need of repose and we urge him to rest now so that heand wemay be thankful for better work hereafter,englishfiction_contra
fiction shakespeares christmas and other stories by q a t quillercouch smith elder 6s of the seven stories in this volume not a single one perhaps could have been written by any one else but mr quillercouch everybody who likes qs work will enjoy them the only question is as to how much there is here which might lay claim to a place in a selection of the writers very best things and that is an interesting point when  q is on the table for when a tale or a salad is good enough to appeal alike to the eclectic and to those with more catholic palates one always wonders what the particular ingredient may be the absence of which would just spoil its peculiar zest for the few and yet make little or no difference to the many most people if asked why they like q will answer readily enough citing his masterful romanticism his sensibility to light and colour or the sap that runs so strongly through bis graceful springy tales of adventure by those signs they would readily pick out an unsigned tale as his even if the scene did not happen to be laid in the west country or the peninsula during the  backalong times when we fought boney but when mr quillercouch is at his happiest there is something else tooa kind of lyric salt as it were in the very air of his tales the res ult one thinks of all the lyrics he has ever read and loved which gives them a stimulating sting and tone in one of the best of these tales indeed the lamp and the guitar a lyric is actually introduced and used as a motif and a ringing raiting little song it is to prick you into alert apprehension with the very first line you can hear the guitars snapping and chiming to it from  my love she lives in salamanca down to  copy luisalove all spain  and when luisa herself sings it bravely with the rest it is not mr quillercouchs fault if you do not want to know what kind of pain the irony in it gives her the pathos of it all is that pretty luisa who flings her charm over a tittle band of patriots in the peninsular war loves not all spain but one alone of her countrymen who jealous magnanimous melancholy only finds out too late i that she had lived and would at any time have died for his sake yet manus macneill secret service agent who saw something of this romance and jotted it down in his memoirs does not dwell overmuch upon it though fuentes the spaniard was bis colleague and friend he had seen no doubt too many sad things in spain but the gusty glimpse that the reader gets of the story is perhaps all the finer for that turning from tragedy to comedy a certain  virtuous good song  ye sexes give ear i  lends title and theme to a capital breezy tale of a boatrace rowed and won against men by six strapping women ot saltash while lyric snatches abound again in the piece which gives its title to the book  shakespeares christmas  is not so much a story as a kind of daring brilliant invasion torch in hand of the intimate haunts of the elizabethan dramatists but torches however well they flare and however high you hold them are apt to throw disconcerting shadows especially if the night be foggy and in this succession of weird scenes the lights and shadows flicker somewhat bewilderingly over shakespeare and the burbages william herbert and nashe and young ben jonson as for john shakespeare that lusty roaring countryman who comes up from warwickshire for a london christmas he sees only  life  in the tremendous revels in the tavern on bankside it is left to the somewhat sorry london apprentice whom he carries with him to become a helpless spectator of the murder which follows hard upon the evenings amusement but mr quillercouch sees further than either and if the doubtful reader be in search of a clue he may perhaps find it in the quotation from bunyan which does duty as a foreword to the whole matter if this vivid excursus is neither quite history nor suite fiction it is at any rate the one thing in the book aat is sure to arrest the attention of all who open it it certainly fosters the hope that some day mr quillercouch may cover instead of continuing to experiment with a really big canvas,englishfiction_contra

kathie brande a fireside histor of a quiet life by holme leo 2 vols smith elder  cothe story of kathie brande is intended to set forth the beauty and virtue of selfsacrifice but for a sacrifice to be noble the object must be worthy otherwise the heroism is a mistake and the generosity waste with a great power of selfsacrifice the author has not endowed kathie brande with any sense of justice nor with the power of discerning the greater from the less in the interests and affairs of life hence the great fault of the book which entirely mars the effect intended and instead of inspiring the reader with any enthusiasm for his duties leaves a depressing enervating influence the tone of the story throughout is morbid and painful kathie brande the heroine is the eldest of the familythe fither is dead and she is the stay and comfort of her mother all this is extremely good and very well told there is one brother stephen a handsome and entirely worthless young man the idol of his mother who subjects the rest of her family to privation in order to send this son to college that he may enter the church for no other reason than that his father and grandfather had been clergymen before him kathie has meanwhile become engaged to an excellent man and they are to be married in the springwhen news comes that the brother has been expelled from college in disgrace and overwhelmed with debt kathie and her mother resolve to pay to the uttermost farthing and for thia the mother gives up her annuity and kathie a legacy and her intended marriage in order that by hard work and pinching economy the spendthrifts debts of honour and debts of extravagance may be paid the weak and partial mother allows this and goes on adoring the son who has brought all this evil upon them the lover behaves nobly and the engagement endures for seven yearsat the end of which time kathie suddenly breaks it off because as the last sister wishes to marry kathie chooses to remain to work for her mother the lover remonstrates and pleads that he has enough for her and her mother and would gladly take both kathie replies like a heroine my mother would never bear dependence even on her childrenand after having used up the seven best years of a good mans life and worn out the elasticity of his spirits and character she is utterly unable to see ber own injustice and persists in immolating both him and herself the mother who ia an exasperating model of maternal excellence accepts this sacrifice also  and when it is just too lato to retract what has been done she dieb leaving kathie an unprotected heroine on the face of the earth with the testimony of her own conscience that she has sacrificed the solemn troth she had plighted to her lover in order to take up a burden which waa uot laid upon her to discern where one duty ends and another begins to keep the balance of responsibilities true not to give one a fantastic preference over another is essential to a healthy morality moral deformity has its rise like physical deformity in the undue exaggeration of some one organ over all the rest,englishfiction_contra

  ashiros kassi the copt a romance of modern egypt by edwin de leon late united states consulgeneral for egypt chapman and hall oriental social life is a tolerably new subject for a novel and mr de leon has succeeded in producing by help of it a very readable and interesting volume his official position and long residence in egypt have evidently given him exceptional facilities for becoming acquainted with eastern customs throughout the book a feeling of sympathy with and appreciation of the modern oriental is apparent marking the superior adaptability of the travelled american to the travelled englishman there is none of the intensely patronising assumption which our own countrymen are in the habit of using when describing their dealings with an inferior race  and with the exception of lady duff gordons letters from egypt we do not remember any more appreciative descriptions of oriental society the story opens at the hotel dorient in cairo in which is assembled a party consisting of mr van camp who is described as a genuine knickerbocker his daughter the heroine of the story her brother a young englishman who with a republican indifference to titles is sometimes styled  sir charles  and sometimes  my lord and miss priscilla prenmiris a strongminded spinster of the modern american type the hero of the story askaros kassis appears on the scene and enchants the fair young american by his general appearance and feats of horsemanship this paragon of an egyptian has had every advantage as to training and education having been sent early to england and instructed at eton miss van camps brother who it appears has partaken of similar advantages at once recognises askaros as an old schoolfellow and a close intimacy ensues it appears that askaros has incurred the hatred of the then viceroy abbas pasha by putting himself under the powerful protection of one of the consulsgeneral accordingly he is soon seized by the viceroys order and imprisoned in the citadel of cairo but not until he has succeeded in making himself useful to miss van camp by twice saving her life the consulgeneral on hearing of the imprisonment of his favourite demands his liberation and the unfortunate viceroy is heavily browbeaten by the unbending consul askaros is liberated but having been concerned in an intrigue with a princess nezle a relation of the viceroy which now threatens to produce unpleasant consequences ho thinks it best to leave egypt and finally seeks the protection of the great sheik abou gosh of the beni hassan who is then encamped with his tribe in the valley of jericho meanwhile the american party in company with sir charles who is an avowed admirer of miss van camp have proceeded up the nile to luxor from whence the englishman is recalled by the news of his fathers death and his accession to his title when next the party meet it is in venice the americans travelling there for pleasure and askaros having been exiled from egypt here miss van camp and sir charles quarrel and askaros marries the heroine whom he takes back to egypt of the succeeding adventures the abduction qf the wife of askaros into the pashas harem and finally the murder of abbas pasha we can only say they are related with considerable dramatic power and that the author shows a minute acquaintance with his subject though abounding with startling incidents the book ia not sensational in the modern sense of the word and the reader who desires some acquaintance with eastern life and habits of thought will do well to read  askaros kassis the copt,englishfiction_contra
miriam or the power of truth a jewi8h tale by the author of  influence eighth edition 12mo pp 388 london 1845 hatchard and co a eighth edition of a fiction proves that it must possess some at least of the qualifications for popularity and that implies the presence of characteristics that appeal to our common nature and therefore proceed from sincerity of purpose in the writer miriam is a religious tale written with a distinct and avowed purpose and this may be one cause of its great success but that alone would not have carried it through eight editions and we find in fact that it is interesting in its story and eloquent in its language and though to us it ap pears to be too much amiplified and might be improved by the curtailment of many of the dialogues and descriptions and the omission of some obtrusive reflections and sermonizing still to other tastes this has proved to be no objection and success is a fair test of fitness to please the public,englishfiction_contra
letters from egypt 186365 london saturday june 10 1865 literature by lady duff gordon macmillan  co narrative of a years journey through central and eastern arabia 186263 by william gifford palgrave 2 vols macmillan  co it is a rare thing to have two works so important on cognate subjects issued on the same day and by the same publishing firm as lady gordons letters and mr palgraves narrative since lane produced his modern egyptians we have had no such pleasant addition to our knowledge of arab life on the middle nile as these letters from egypt by lady duff gordon offer a few bits from these pictures have already appeared in the athencwm kindly transcribed for our use by the eminent lady to whom they were addressed but let us hasten to add in fear of misunderstanding that the volume is a new book as fresh in interest as it is sweet and bright in style lady gordon has lived with the arabs and become bint el beleda daughter of the country the present visit to the nile was not her first bhe stayed her year and a half upon the river and its banks and she has friends and kinsmen in important posts in egypt this should be said by way of warrant that her stories of the people and their ways of living and thinking are not dropped by her in either ignorance or sport these stories will be rather surprising to people who have been taught to regard the arabs as dirty and lazy hareem life as a sink of iniquity and islam as a foul and corrupting creed a pious old scotch friend who called on lady gordon at eluksur told her in the course of a long and orthodox wail on the state of egypt that there was some truth certainly in the moslem faith but that this portion of truth was the work of satan whose  toeenisters the ulema were lady gordon adds that as satan would have it the people were just then reading the koran in the hall and that one of them who was giving a feast that day at his own expense came in at the instant and gtitely offered the scotch critic a dish of sweets he is very fond of telling these little anecdotes in favour of arab toleration of her arab teacher sheikh yoosuf a teacher of the law a man whom the jews would have called a rabbi a masterwe grow in these letters to be fond as of a familiar friend and this no less on account of his childlike wisdom and insight as to moral and spiritual things than for nis gentleness of manner and his purity of heart sheikh yoosuf is indeed woefully ignorant of many things he never in his life wore gloves ate with a fork or tasted pale ale he has but a vague notion of the dignities and uses of a bishop and never heard of a public meeting in his life yet in lady gordons opinion this untutored son of the desert has a good deal of natural piety and of acquired toleration he abstains from tobacco and preaches to his neighbours once a weekon friday he reads and believes in the holy books including the new testament which last he says is a true book only the bad christians have perverted its sense in many ways when it was proposed to send a young boy to england the simple sheikh desired lady gordon to read the gospels with the boy before he left egypt so that he might understand them truly and not fall into peril of his soul through the inventions of vulgar and bad people yoosuf has some ideas which lady gordon quotes with high approval  i was talking the other day with yoosuf about people trying to make converts and i uttered that eternal betise  oh they mean well true 0 lady perhaps they do mean well but god says in the noble koran that he who injures or torments those christians whose conduct is not evil merely on account of religion shall never smell the fragrance of the garden paradise now when men begin to want to make others change their faith it is extremely hard for them not to injure or torment them and therefore i think it better to abstain altogether and to wish rather to see a christian a good christian and a muslim a good muslim after telling a story in which a doctor of the law had likened her to a good moslem lady gordon sums up in a few words her observations on the religious change now passing over islam i believe that a great change is taking place among the ulema that islam is ceasing to be a mere partyflag just as occurred with christianity and that all the moral part is being more and more dwelled on my great aliin also said i had practised the precepts of the koran and then laughed and said i suppose i ought to say the gospel but what matters it the truth el hakk is one whether spoken by our lord eesa or by our lord mohammad to like the arabs as lady gordon likes them you must not only live among them but have some natural genius for the study of their manners very particular persons are not likely to do it to pious british females in general the egyptian fellaheen will always present themselves as poor things french women do not easily get used to them rachel for her sins went up the nile and stayed three months in the very village occupied by our countrywoman  she hated it so that on embarking to leave she turned back and spat on the ground and cursed the place inhabited by such savages we can well believe it and yet sheikh yoosuf lived there as well as mustapha the consular agent who keeps a clerk and lends his horses and gives dinners and receives no pay what is a man like yoosuf to mdlle lecouvreur french women says lady gordon generally do not like the arabs who they say are not at all galants as i write this i laugh to think of gcuanterie and arab in one sentence and glance at my brother yoosuf who is sleeping on a mat quite overcome with the simoom which is blowing and the fast which he is keeping today as the eve of the eed elkebir as an arab dare not look into a womans face unless she is his wife or slave it is quite easy to see how a french actress should find him wanting in gallantry eating with the hands instead of with knives and forks is another great trial of manners in which the poor arab comes off badly in the opinion of most europeans a great deal can be said in favour of eating with the fingers and lady gordon says she has come to prefer food with fingersarab fingers as she explains  which are washed fifty times a day we have ourselves been on the nile and have tented in the desert and we can say thus much in confirmation of our authors experience that we have no objection to eating with fingersfor arabs for ourselves we prefer knives and forks more than once we tried to dip into a common dish of stewed olives mutton and lentils but the english feeling in favour of forks was too strong and after two or three trials we gave up the attempt to conquer this particular prejudice but then our opportunities were limited we had not been a year and a half in an arab village and learnt like lady gordon to live upon nothing like every one who dwells in the east lady gordon sees how wonderfully the daily life of sheikhs and peasants explains the holy scriptures and she has many a sly little laugh in her letters over the ignorance of men who ought to do better things for example she says in one placei received an illustrated news with a print of a ridiculous rebekah at the well from a picture by hilton with regard to eastern subjects two courses are opento paint like mediaeval painters white people in european clothes or to come and see mawkish misses in fancy dress are not benat elarab like rebekah nor would a respectable man go on his knees like an old fool before the girl he was asking in marriage for the son of his master of all comical things though victor hugos  orientales is the funniest elephants at smyrna whynot at paris and london quelle couleur locale sheikh yoosuf had a good laugh over hiltons rebekah and the camels more like pigs as to their heads he said we must have strange ideas of the booka of towrt the pentateuch in europe and sheikh yoosuf is assuredly right about our strange notions of the pentateuch of all the great questions which agitate human beings that of the relations of man to woman is beyond compare the most complex and attractive and it is also that in which eastern life affords us an experience wholly unlike our own in egypt as in every part of islam the man has rights which europe denies to him and the woman has rights which europe denies to her the chief of these rights are that the man can marry four wives and buy as many slaves for concubines as his purse will permit and that the woman has a perfect claim to maintenance and to all her powers as a citizen and a human being in europe where men have made the laws and the public opinion we think a great deal of the fact of polygamy and in many of our thoughts the whole system of life in tne east appears to turn upon this domestic arrangement as the cardinal fact it may be that it does so turn many male voices assure us of it but then we know that it is extremely hard for a man who merely stays in cairo or sails up the nile to learn anything trustworthy about the hareem only a woman can enter that secret corner of a moslems home and few english women have had the opportunities of seeing and hearing of these strange matters for themselves miss martineau speaks very strongly against hareem life but then miss martineau is neither a mother nor a wife and her knowledge of conjugal relations is necessarily slight and secondhand it is doubtful whether any english matron would consider an old maid a fair judge of married life even in our own country on this delicate topic lady gordon is particularly full and explicit we believe her letters were written to her mother and her daughter ladies with whom she had no reason to be reserved on such points and whether her observations on arab domestic life should prove to be final or otherwise the matter which she presents is curious and startling to begin with unlike miss martineau she is enamoured of oriental female charms if i can get hold of a handsome fellaheh here i will get her photographed to show you in europe what a womans breast can be for i never knew it before i came here it is the most beautiful thing in the world and gloriously independent of stays or any support lady gordon is so well known in society as a woman of beautiful race that her compliment to the egyptian peasant may be taken at its highest value without injustice now let us descend at once on the domestic carpet says ladygordon thereare a good many things about bareena hm which i am barbarian enough to think extretaely good and rational i heard from an earwitaeae a conversation which passed between an old turk of cairo and a yoong englishman who politely chaffed him about muslim license upon thu the venerable turk who had been in europe asked toms questions ae to the nature and number of the englishman relations to women which the latter was wholly unable to answer  well young man said the turk  i am old and was married at twelve and i hare seen in all my life seven women four are dead and three are happy and comfortable in my house where are all yours as a woman is never seen but by her husband or possessor the word has acquired another meaning it was a very difficult question for the european to answer on another occasion we read  i heard a curious illustration of arab manners today i met hasan the janissary ofthe american consulate a very resjhjctable good man he told me he had married another wife since last year i asked what for it waa the widow of his brother who had always lived in the same house with him like one family and who died leaving two boys she is neither young nor handsome but he considered it his duty to provide for her aud the children and not let her marry a stranger so yon so that polygamy is not always sensual indulgence  and a roan may thus practice greater selfsacrifice than by talking sentiment about deceased wives sisters i said laughing to omar as we went on that i did not think the two wives sounded very comfortable  oh no not comfortable at all for the man but he take care of the woman that is what is proper that is the good muslim this feeling says lady gordon is universal in egypt in noticing a few days ago the mohammedan laws we spoke of the husbands obligation to maintain his wife at all costs lady gordon tells a little story in point  a man married at alexandria and took home the daily provisionn for the first week after that he neglected it for two days and came home with a lemon in his hand he asked for some dinner and his wife placed the stool and the tray and the washingbasin and napkin and on the tray the lemon cut in half well and the dinner  dinneryou want dinner where from what man are you to want women when you dont keep them i am going now to the kamee to be divorced from you  and she did the min must provide all necessaries for his hareem and if she bas money or earn any she spends it in dress if she makes him a skull cap or a handkerchief he must pay for her work all is not roses for these eastern tyrantsnot to speak of the unbridled licence of tongue allowed to women and children zeyneb hectors omar and i cant persuade him to check her  how i say anything to it that one child omar is a perfect treasury of unconscious fun and knowledge he is an index to egyptian life here to wit is a curious trait in europe men may speak to each other of many delicate things which they could not speak to a woman about in egypt it is the other way a man may speak to a woman not his wife of things which it would be considered indecorous for him to mention to a man tims when seleem effendi told lady gordon about his purchase of a young black slave for his hareem omar said it is proper to say such things to a lady but wrong to mention them before men again omar gave lady gordon a very particular account of his own marriage  i intimated she writes that english people were not accustomed to some words he used and might be shocked upon which he said  of course i not speak my hareem to english gentleman but to good lady can speak it from omar indeed we get many a curious glimpse into this unknown hareem life  he tells me his domestic affairs and talks about though women of his family whioh he would not do to a maa he refused to speak to his brother a very grand dragoman who was with the prince of wales this man came op to us in the hotel at cairo and addressed omar who turned his back on him i asked the reason and omar told me how bis brother had a wife an old wifebeen with him long time very good wife she had had three children all dead all at once the dragoman who is much older than omar declared he would divorce her and marry a yoong woman omar said  no dont do that keep her in your house as head of your household and take one of your two black slavegirls as your hareem but the other insisted and married a young turkish wife whereupon omar took his poor old sisterinlaw to live with him and his own young wife and cut his grand brother dead see how characteristic the urging his brother to take the young slavegirl  as his hareem like a respectable man that would have been all right but what he did was not good ill trouble you as mrsused to say to settle these questions to every ones satisfaction omars account of the household of his other brother a confectioner with two wives was very curious he and his wife aad they all live together one ofthe brothers wives has six children three sleep with their own mother and three with their other mother and all is quite harmonious it is certainly very odd and quite unlike what english people fancy polygamy must be until we came to govern india and to study the mohammedan law most of us imagined that an oriental woman was a slavea slave to a brutal and voluptuous tyrantwho found a ready punishment for her infidelities in the bowstring or the rack we never dreamed that an arab wife had rights we never conceived the idea of an oriental being compassionate towards the weaker sex and were probably unacquainted with the moslem duty of  concealing evil once on a time lady gordon surprised her pious servant into the avowal of a doctrine that will undoubtedly shock every  wellregulated mind  it is impossible to conceive how startling it is to a christian to hear the rules of morality applied with perfect impartiality to both sexes and to hear arabs who know our manners say that europeans are  hard upon their women and do not fear god and conceal their offences i asked omar who is very correct in his notions whether if he saw his brothers wife do anything wrong he would tell her husband nb he cant endure her  certainly not he said  i must cover her with my cloak of course the offence of unchasteness is very great but though arab holds it to be equally great in man and in woman and his instinct revolts gainst the terrible punishment sometimes inflicted on the weaker party to this sin mr palgraves narrative of a years journey through central and eastern arabia is a much longer and graver work than lady gordons  letters having a different kind of interest for its readers and indeed appealing to a different class of readers altogether lady gordons is a book for everybody a volume for the summer lawn for the seaside and the easychair an idleness a delight and a pastime mr palgrave addresses the geographer and the politician who must take to him map in hand and with all that has been written on arabia fresh in his mind he is expected to know everything about places the very names of which are not to be found in ordinary maps of the countrymaan for example mr palgraves point of departure the  narrative in truth is a piece of solid reading both in its matter and its type in the east a man travels at a great disadvantage compared to a woman a woman may enter an arab nouseholda man may not more than half the worldand by far the most fascinating portion of itis therefore cut off absolutely from masculine observation a man can see the outsides of things in towns the walks the public gardens the streets the caravanserais and in the country the fields wells mountains sand plains and so forth but of the domestic life he can study absolutely nothing still even in matters open to mans observation there is a great deal yet for ns to learn in the arabian peninsulageography ethnologytopography and agriculture and we will say very confidently that in these mattera of public knowledge no work of recent yean has added so much to the stock of general information about arabia as mr palgraves  narrative mr palgrave has gone over a new route from the dead sea to the persian gulf and contrary to the expectation of most persons he has found that instead of a magnificent waste peopled only by a few nomadic shammar and anezi bedouins it is in a great measure a settled country sprinkled with towns and villages having resident kings and sheikhs with a fixed policy a peaceful commerce ana extending alliances in fact the result of his journey is to give us a new map of arabia more than a new map indeed he gives us unlike lady gordon who has been studying arab life in its domestic as well as in its publio aspects he thinks poorly of his oriental friends and he is especially fierce upon their religious practices mr palgrave asks his reader to dismiss all his romantic and excited notions about bedouin freedom arabic culture and mohammedan piety these are all delusions he asserts in a thousand places the bedouins are false and brutal savages the arabs have no science never had any he says not even the moors of cordova and granada and while he maintains that the faith of islam never exercised much real influence in arabia he somewhat inconsistently as it seems to us declares that islam is one of the main causes perhaps the chief cause ofthe backward condition of arabia these views being novel to say the least we should have been glad to know a little more of the critic than he has been pleased to tell us is he free from national and sectarian bias  what were his objects in travel  how far were his disguises and misrepresentations necessary to his safety what are his religious opinions two rays of light we get upon these questions in the preface mr palgrave tells us that he was in connexion with the order of jesus and that louis napoleon paid his expenses what mysteries of purpose these two statements may be held to cover we shall not affect to guess but mr palgrave would not hate made them public unless he had desired his reader to bear them in mind with the caution implied in this reference to the circumstances under which mr palgrave travelled in arabia we may quote his opinions about the arabs the wild arab of the desert and the settled arab of the inland towns arab nationalitythus far like that ofthe historical jew or the highlanderis and always has been from the very earliest times based on the divisions of families and clans tribes as they are often called nor is the name misapplied if taken in its original sense of hereditary alliance without the additional idea of barbarism and unsettled life often annexed to it in its modern application the tribes or dans were soon by the nature of the land itself divided each and every one into two branches correlative indeed but of unequal size and importance the greater section remained as townsmen or pea sants in the districts best susceptible of culture and permanent occupation where they still kept up much of their original clannish denominations and forms though often blended and even at times obliterated by the fusion inseparable from civil and social organization the other and leaser portion devoted themselves to a pastoral life for which the desert that is about a third in extent of the arabian peninsula affords ample scope they too retained their original clannish and family demarcations but unsoftened by civilization and unblended by the links of closedrawn society so that in this point and indeed in this alone they have continued to be the faithful depositaries of primaeval arab tradition and constitute a sort of standard rule for the whole nation hence when genealogical doubts and questions of descent arise as they often do among the fixed inhabitantsor dwellers in brick to give citizens and villagers their collective arab denominationrecourse is often had to the neighbouring bedouins for a decision unattainable in the complicated records of town life whereas the living gwillym of the desert can readily explain every quartering and surcharging in every scutcheon of arab nobility but in all other respects in religion arts science and civilization these heralds of the wilds have naturally enough retrograded rather than advanced one step beyond their first condition how indeed could it be otherwise with the desert for their only teacher and camels and ostriches for fellowscholars  hence while the fixed population have added to their first stockinhand of knowledge and arts many of the new acquirements and ameliorations which the progressive law of the human mind when under favourable circumstances never fails to bring among men the bedouins have on the other hand receded to the utmost limit of barbarism possible among arabs and have at last become such as we now see them till they bear the same relation to the rest of their fellowcountrymen that a wild crab offshoot below does to the thriving and fruitladen branches above even their vaunted hospitality to strangers though it is not denied is explained away into something less than the wild virtue which it looks like in our ordinary books their openhandedness often springs more from the childish levity of the savage than from true and praiseworthy liberality of character like an infant that stretches out its small hands and opens its little mouth for whatever comes within its reach be it a guinea or a cherry and with almost equal readiness lets its new acquisition drop no sooner than grasped the bedouin is at once rapacious and profuse coveting all he sees without much distinction of its worth and lightly parting with what he has already appropriated from very incapacity to estimate or appreciate its value to give to beg or to plunder are for him correlative acts all arising in the main from the same immense ignorance of what property really is and what its importance and thus he is often soarce more entitled to commendation for the one act than liable to berious blame for the other  in a word he knows no better besides he has in general but little to offer and for thai very little he not unfrequently promises himself an ample retribution by plundering his lastnights guest when a few hours distant on his morning journey it may be added in this connexion that mr palgrave runs down not only the bedouin but his camel his ass and everything that is his against the camel he nurses an implacable hatred and our old favourite ship of the desert comes out very badly indeed from his shaping hands but the great vials of mr palgraves wrath are reserved for the bedouin upon whom and upon whose friends he has poured out all his indignation for example  the european public is deluged with accounts of arab customs arab ways arab qualities houses dresses women warriors and what not the most part from materials collected in syria mesopotamia egyptirak perhaps tunis algiers and morocco or at the best in djiddah and on the ites sea coast sometimes a romantic spirit will rnnsh scenes among the hybrid bedouins of palmyra as portraits of arab life sometimes we are invited to study arab society in a divan at gabo or aleppo such narratives however accurate they may be for the localities and raoes they dsasribe have not an equal claim to the title of correct delineations of arabs and of arab customs the case appears to me much as if the description of a backwoodsman of ohio should be given for a faithful portrait of a yorkshire farmer or the ways and doings of connaught for a sketch of norfolk life and manners syria and egypt palmyra and bagdad even less mosoul and algiers are not arabia nor are their inhabitants arabs the populations alluded to are instead a mixture of curd es turcomans syrians phoanicians armenians berbers greeks turks copts albanians chaldeeans not to mention the remnants of other and older races with a little a very little arab blood one in twenty at most and that little rediluted by local and territorial influences that all more or less speak arabic is a fact which gives them no more claim to be numbered among arabs than speaking bad english makes an englishman of a native of connaught or of texas for the popular figure of the bedouin i must add that even were he sketched as he rarely is from the genuine nomade of arabia it would be no juster to bring him forward as an example of arab life and society than to publish the pickwick papers or nicholas nickleby with scenes in high life or tales of the howards on the back these unlucky and muchtalkedof bedouins in the syrian also miscalled arabian desert are in fact only hybrids crosses between turcoman and  curdiah tribes with a small and questionable in  fusion of arab blood and that too none of the best i like a wineglass of thin claret poured into a tumbler of water in short among these races i town or bedouin we have no real authentic arabs  arabia and arabs begin south of syria and pales  tine weet of basrah and zobeyr east of kerak  and the red sea draw a line across from the top of the bed sea to the top

on monday evening in a paper to be read before the geographical society is better known to travellers  but even here mr palgrave supplies a vast deal of detail as to men and things useful to a politician the route of his travel lay through iliad to hof hoof and kateef overland then bywater to bedaa linja sharjah orniuz sohar and mascat adventures in the desert and a storm at sea varied the journey with a dash of personal danger but the end of all was happy the traveller returned to europe by way of bagdad aleppo and the syrian coast mr palgraves journey is described with a minuteness truly arabic he seems to have listened to the coffeehouse storytellers until he has caught their manner of narrationa chief merit of which is that the story shall never end hence we have digression upon digression parenthesis within parenthesis so that nearly every page contains a reference to something already told or a promise that byandby it shall be delivered more at length the effect of such a method of storytelling may be very delightful in cairo or damascus where the sun ia fierce and the palmtree shady and a man may sit with his amber tube at his lips and dream away his hours in luxurious peace but in busy london with the pulse of life and thought electric in speed the effect of this manner of longdrawn discourse is not so acceptable the reader is always expecting to be told mr palgraves secret all the more so when such a barbarian as telal is taken into his confidence but he waits and hopes in vain the general of the jesuits and the emperor of the french keep their own whatever it may be and mr palgrave has probably made to these authorities a secret ana separate report we take what we are offered and are thankful for it but we cannot help following the train of speculation suggested by the preface and wondering whether the result of this daring journey has been to enrich the generals library or the emperors stable,englishfiction_contra
browinlows mrs olipitants recent novel was originally published in blackwoods 3magazine but it extended over so many numbers that it was scarcely possible to form anything like a correct estimate of its qualities in its present form the story will be looked upon with much interest the impression produced by the minute characterpainting and patient fidelity of the chronicles of carlingford  being yet fresh in the recollection of most readers of fiction brownlows  will be chiefly welcomed on account of its negative virtues there is an entire absence of the melodramatic vulgar and coarse qualities which make so many modern novels offensive mrs oliphant is never affectedly cynical her characters never talk bombast and she never for a moment approaches that region of detective murder and adultery fiction with which we are familiar these are merely negative virtues but they are none the less grateful on that account when we come to the positive merits of the book we regret that they have been partially obscured by the disproportionate length of the story the simple incidents of the tale the characters and the dialogue suffer alike from a diffuseness which may have been dictated by the exigencies of magazine writing but which should never have been per mitted to disfigure a reprinted work the condensaion of these three volumes into one would have produced an admirable little story pointed and straightforward as  nina balatka  in its progression and perhaps not unworthy to be wompared with that little gem of fiction in style and treatment the skeleton of plot which is clothed by such a mass of writing as  brownlows by mrs oliphant author of  chronicles of cadgfor edinburgh blackwood these volumes offer is exceedingly simple and it is withal novel and interesting the head of the l3rowiilowv family is a solicitor in a country town to whom a certain mirs thomson leaves a fortune of fifty thousand pounids in charge for her daughter who some years before had married a common soldier and been disowned in consequence this dauglhter has not been heard of since and in the event of her not being discovered within twentyfive years from the date of the bequest the money is to revert to mr brownlow he immediately proceeds to ferret cut the missing woman but wholly fails advertisements and private inquiries are equally unavailing and in the end the existence of the woman is almost forgotten brownlow removes to a fine house outside the village which comes in the end to be called  brow nlows and here he lives in good style with his daughter sara and his son jack the twentyfive years are drawing to a close and nothing has been heard of a claimant for the fifty thousand pounds when a young man applied to mr brownlow for a situation as clerk this young man whose name is powys says his mother comes of a good family who once lived in these parts and that his father was a soldier altogether lhe gives sufficient particulars to convince mr brownlow that this young mans mother is the owner of the money the use of which he has enjoyed so long he forbears in the mean time to force a full disclosure wvhich would lave necessitated his surrender of this fortune but he engages young powys to be one of his clerks and then asks him to visit brownlows with a view to his forming a mateh with sara this young lady has philosophic views about marriage and privately declares to a friend that she does not believe in love and that she will marry any suitor whom her father recommends this she promises to mar brownlow and there is no doubt from the special favouritism which mr brownlow evinces for the penniless young clerk that she must consider the latter to be the coming man meanwhile another woman called mrs preston and her daughter come to the neighbourhood and take lodgings in a cottage which adjoins brownlows on the day of their arrival the girl falls on the snow and sprains her ankle and jack brow nlow who is passing carries her into the house subsequently he calls to see how she is falls in love with her and she with him the course of the story from this moment ought to be clear to every experienced novelreader powys falls in love with sara and is so bewildered with mr brownlows patronage that he hardly knows whether to make an avowal or not finally he comes to mr brownlow with a bundle of papers which he fancies will prove his gentle lineage and the father discovering that the young man is no relative whatever of the missing heiress quietly packs him out of the house mr brownlow anticipates no opposition to this disposal of matters from the philosophic young lady and he is therefore thunderstruck by the effect the news has upon her this scene is described with much vivid force  hush he said still smoothing her pretty hnir  we have never had many words about it it is all at an end i thought it would be a relief to you to hear  to bear what cried the girl sharply with her head averted and then to her fathers utter cansternation she withdrew as far as she could from his arm and suddenly burst into tears mr brownlow was totally taken by surprise he had not been able to read what was going on in his daughters heart he could not believe now that she understood him he put his hand upon her arm and drew her back  you mistake me my darling be said i mean that you are quite free saraquite free it was wrong of me to ask any promise from you and it was foolish of you to give it but providence thank god has settled that it is all over there is no more necessity cant you forgive me you have not suffered so much from it as i have done before i could have come to the point of sacrificing you   sacrificing e  cried sara suddenly flashing back upon him in a storm of passion and indignation her cheeks s0orching yet wet with tears her big eyes swimming  is that all you think of  you had a right to sacrifice me if you likednobody would have said a word they did it in the bible you might have cut me into little pieces if you liked but oh what right had you how dared you to make a sacrifice of him   him  cried mr browolow and he took a step back in consternation and gazed at his child who was transfigured and a different creature her cheeks blazed under her tears but she did not shrink weeping blushing wounded ashamed she still con fronted him in the strength of some new feeling of which he had never dreamed powys returns to his desk and tries to forget the temporary madness which had induced him to think of sara brownlow so matters roll on and the last day of the twentyfifth year has been reached on the morrow mr brownlow will be a rich man and he hopes by sending jack into parliament to make him forget the daughter of this poor woman pamela preston whom he has vowed to marry shortly before twelve however mrs preston rushes in calls jack and sara to witness in presence of their father that she is in time to claim the money and denounces mr brownlow as an impostor who has cheated her and her daughter and kept them out of their righits brownlow is overwhelmed with the discovery and for the moment harbours the thought of murdering this halfmad and brokendown creature whlo is come to destroy the futureof his children but sara notices this strange look on her fathers face takes the woman under her protection and makes her sleep in her bedroom for that night 3nrs preston shortly afterwards dies jack marries paniela and gets the brownlows and the money  andi zara marries powys whose claims to gentle lineage are tound to be of some value such is the thread on which mrs oliphant has strung her present sketches of character and these it must be said are in parts so full of sym pathetiz power and analysis that one all the more regrets the  spinning out  of which we have spoken sara brownlow is a charming study and the courtship of jack and ipamela preston is described with a quaint humiour and an unaffected tenderness which one does not frequently meet in novels mrs oliphant rarely uses lay figures her characters arc restricted in number and she draws from the life mr llardeastle is rather vague perhaps because he is unimportant and mrs preston is a little theatrical  but those characters on which mrs oliphant has expeuded labour bear witness to the faithfulness ot the hand which wrote the  chronicles of carling ford ivhoever reads  brownlows  through will be satisfied and grateful the misfortune is that the unnecessary copiousness of writing about insiginificant details may at first sight act as a

the nobilitys ballrooms are essentially the same beings as those young bucks old fogies and pretty flirts the natives of much inferior social circles higher up are better manners certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of english society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design perhaps mr thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern english aristocratic society his pictures most likely are not faultless whose are a line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation a man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation and now what is the nature of this fashionable world according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   vanity fair  pendennis  newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one the land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life mr thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that haut tonne is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of haut tonne can present us for the most part with such elements as these is the marquis of steyne a representative personage and his sister lady kew and the most noble farintosh is miss ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and lord kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman does love among these upper clwases usually signify flirtation and life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the world a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand marriage a convenient arrangement and religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like potichomanie and death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones self a still more disagreeable occurrenceare these the polite definitions l it would appear so perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes but do the middle get off any better rather worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of vanity fair than themselves a doleful and depressing view of human nature surely true we have mr pendenniss mother and lady walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have mr pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model i wife and worship him the colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of mr i thackerays creations we can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement with tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample of a young

existence in his companion the youngpainter john james tidley mrthackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin the application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low

emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and

a great mystery solved a great mystery solved being a sequel to the mystery of edwin drood by gillan vase london  remington and co the  mystery of edwin drood  is no longer to be regarded as a mystery under the very promising title of  a great mystery solved we have here a book destined to end the worlds suspense and to quiet all regret that the  fragment of a story so full of promise how condescending to be sure to the late mr charles dickens  could not be finished by the great man who commenced it mr gillan vase is the name of the heroic mortal who has not feared to puck up the pen fallen from the dead hand of charles dickens and to finish off his incomplete work for him courage rather than modesty would appear to be the distinguishing virtue of mr gillan vase he does not himself appear to be afflicted with any timidity about this  ambitious attempt to finish a work commenced by one of englands most illustrious writers  but since  it has been deemed advisable we presume by mr vases publishersthat he shouldnot apologise of course but let us say offer some explanation to his readers for what he aptly describes as this  audacious venture mr vase with some naivete proceeds to relate how he came to enter upon the undertaking some years ago then mr gillan vase first read the fragment of the  mystery of edwin drood grieved at the abrupt interruption of the story he waited impatiently in the hope that some one else some one of dickens many literary friends would gather up the broken threads and weave the story to its end mr vase had apparently overlooked the note affixed to the last number of  edwindrood in which the friends of mr dickens stated their belief that what the author would himself have most desired was done in placing before the reader without further note or suggestion the last pages written by him only a few short hours before his death at any rate mr gillan vase grew weary of waiting and brave man that he is began to solve the mysteryat first only for himself and for some appreciative friends but after a little while a very strange thing happened something stirred within mr gillan vase  something strangely like ambition1  i soon discovered he observes almost to my consternation that i had entered upon a road from which there is no turning back even though only the grisly hag disappointment should be in waiting at the end i had raised a monster which took possession of me body and soul for whoever takes up an authors pen however thoughtlessly is very soon not its master but its slave wc are not quite sure whether the last somewhat alarming statement is to be taken as applying to the pen of authorship generally or whether it applies to the special case of picking up other peoples pens and adopting so far as ones ingenuity admits of ones doing so their manner of writing but in thc latter case thc observation is singularly appropriate a distinguished american medium has we believe claimed to have received the only time and authentic conclusion to thc mystery ol edwin drood  from the spirit of charles dickens himself i mr gillan vase it will be observed does not claim to be the spokesman and slave of the spirit of dickens but only of his pen and this exactly represents his position he uses indeed the selfsame pen and dips it in the selfsame inkand forms his handwriting upon the same model but if the pen be the pen of dickens the hand which holds it and the spirit which guides the hand are those of mr gillan vaseof mr gillan yrase with a  something stirring within him strangely like ambition we are not quarrelling with mr gillan vase because of his ambition vaulting ambition is no crime in literature even when as sometimes happens  it ocrleaps itself the head and front of mr gillan vases offending is not that he has attempted to continue dickens to the best of his ability and has fa lcd but that he has with a great deal of perverted ingenuity set seriously to work to mimic dickens and in a lamentable way may besaid to have succeeded it is the reverse of the old fairy vale when straw was spun into gold mr vase has indeed gathered up in his hand the broken threads of th story but these threads of pure gold have magically and imperceptibly become transformed by his touch int common straw and the worst of the matter is that it is extremely difficult to realise afterwards that they ever were threads of gold honest and eccentric mr grewgious is made to insist so frequently upon his angularity and to smooth his head with such wearisome persistency and to deny his susceptibility to anything like sentiment being so patently open to sentiment all the time that at length he becomes not only a little like a hypocrite but even a good deal like a bore bright openhearted mr crisparkle in though same way makes his open heart a weariness to the spirit stately miss twinkelton quite descends from her dignified but gracious pedestal and becomes a vulgar and spiteful old maid setting her cap at every stray bae h dor she may chance to meet mrs crisparkle the pretty od luna shepherdess becomes such an artificial china shepherdess that it would be a great consolation if she would only get broken and put upon one side aneldurdles eventhe incom irable durdles becomes simply a very illmannered stone un son addie ted to bad language when in his cups and the strange the fatal part of the business is that all this mischief is done without any glaring departure from the style and plan of the original on the contrary such constant care and watchfulness have been observed to make the different personages of the story act up to their several characters they an so laborously themselves and insist so upon making us remark that they have lost none of their idiosyncrasies and peculiarities in passing out of the hands of their creator charles dickens into those of their showman mr gillan vase that our distaste towards them in their last state semiehow spreads back to them in their first and wc are afraid that no one who has been sufficiently unfortunate to read a great mystery solved will ever again be able to revert with the same pleasure to the mystery of edwin drood it docs not appear tonnes that a writer who constitutes himself thecontinuator of to use his own expression  one of tin most illustrious of englands writers has the smallest claim to any indulgence wo have not therefore hesitated to express our opinion that a great mystery solved might much more appropriately be entitled a great work spoiled at the same time we do not mean to deny that mr gillan vase has displayed a good deal of ingenuity in handling an extremely complicated plot and in working out from it a sufficiently probable conclusion fleas are not lobsters and ingnuity is not genius and mr gillan vase is not charles dikens nevertheless epiite enough cleverness has been thmwn away upon this untoward venture to provo that the author if he will consent to drop the pen of dickens and t  take up his own is capable of producing a very readable nov1,englishfiction_contra

to be an authority on the subjectthe introducer into england of milkpunch she has left behind her apart from her published or acted works few trustworthy memories her origin is a matter of dispute according to accepted biographies she was of aristocratic birth and surroundings her father whose name was johnson member of a family established in canterbury being a relative of lord willoughby by whose interest he was appointed lieutenantgeneral of surinam and sixandthirty islands for this parentage there seems to be some foundation since it was on a voyage to the west indies for the purpose of entering on the duties in question that johnson died in common with the rest of her family aphra settled in surinam where her adventurous career began as though she had not names enoughand most if not all of the variants assigned her were accepted and employed by herself  the appellation astrea bestowed upon her by her admiring contemporaries was advanced by langbaine as her real name it was not until the 6th of september 1884 that the accuracy of the accepted biographies was called seriously into question in the athenaum of that date appeared a letter from mr edmund gosse to whom is due the memoir in the  dictionary of national biography chronicling the discovery in the register of wye in kent of an entry of the baptism on the 10th of july 1640 of ayfara daughter of john johnson a barber and of amy his wife on the strength of this notice mr gosse assumes that the alleged parent was a more distant relative whom she called father if we accept this theory for what it is worth the question is suggested whether the relations between lord willoughby and aphra if parental were necessarily legitimate it is possible that an investigationwere the matter of sufficient importanceof the records of surinam or dutch guiana might throw some light upon it on the cession of surinam to the dutch aphra who had lived at st johns hill the best house in the colonyreturned to london where a few years later she married behn a dutch merchant through whom she is said to have gained admittance at court in 1666 after his death she was sent as a secret agent to the netherlands returning thence when on the point of contracting second nuptials which however fell through owing to the death of her lover she was wrecked losing her entire property and narrowly escaping with her life the secret whioh in the course of her flirtations she had surprised of the intention of the dutch to sail up the thames and burn the english ships in the medway was derided at court her applications for a payment she had well earned were refused she appears to have been lodged in gaol for debt and found herself compelled to seek a living by her pen the tragedies with which she approached the stage were unsuccessful and it was not until she produced comedy after comedy licentious in intrigue and coarse in dialogue but possessed of a certain measure of vivacity and spirit that she won recognition during a literary career which lasted for something under a quarter of a century she acquired the intimacy of dryden killigrew tate otway and the wits of the day and when in 1689 she died owing to the ignorance of her physician she found a restingplace in poets corner westminster abbey where on a slab of marble her name may still be read the irony of fate thus pursued her to the end and the woman whose name not too justly has become a byword in such state doth lie as has been vainly demanded for more than one of the greatest poets of following centuries it was at surinam that aphra made the acquaintance of oroonoko the african prince whose adventures she narrates in the bestknown of her romances how much of the story she tells is fact and how much fiction is as doubtful as are most other things connected with her life and proceedings the novelist was credited by her contemporaries with intimate and dishonouring relations with her hero a gratuitous and wildly improbable suspicion for never surely did an amorous woman depict a successful rival in colours so bright as those bestowed upon imoinda the inspirer of oroonokos passion and the sharer in his fate seven years after mrs benns death the story of oroonoko was dramatised by thomas southerne who afterwards expressed his regret at having coupled so touching a theme with comic scenes of extreme coarseness southernes tragedy was thrice amended or imitated a pale and colourless rendering by dr hawkesworth being lukewarmly defended by jdr johnson from one or other of these dramatisations the popular idea if such can be said to exist of oroonoko is drawn the fable itselfwe leave the reader to accept the word in whichsoever sense it commends itself to himbelongs wholly to mrs behn and to her is due the credit of finding in a fugitive african slave a subject for romance at a period when the choice by shakespeare of a moor as a hero was being seriously rebuked that there is a basis of fact in the story of  oroonoko or the royal slave will not be seriously disputed the narrator claims to have been an eyewitness of the deeds she recounts and asserts  what i could not be witness of i received from the mouth of the chief actor in this history the hero himself who gave us the whole transactions of his youth she states also that she had had presented to her a set of feathers such as were converted into dresses adding what is credible enough that she gave them to the kings theatre  it was the dress of the indian queen infinitely admired by persons of quality and was inimitable a costume of the sort is characteristic it might be supposed of the aborigines of the island rather than of the african importations with whom they had nothing in common except experience of european treachery cruelty and deceit it is the indians of whom mrs behn speaks rather than africans when she says that such is their respect for truth and ignorance of falsehood that when the english governor who had pledged himself to meet them failed either to come or to send a message they mourned and fasted for the death which alone could as they assumed have caused his absence oroonoko himself is described as a black a perfect ebony or polished jet with eyes  the most awful that could be seen a nose  rising and roman and a mouth firmly shaped and with no signs of the thick lips of the negro his sentimental adventures may be assumed to be in part imaginative but his death in circumstances of revolting cruelty after heading a servile revolt has nothing that offends probability mrs behn is then to be credited with being among the first to denounce the horrors and atrocities of slavery had the whole of her novels been as simple and direct as this story they would have taken a permanent place in literature the more serious of them are however extravagant in action and commonplace in style most of them bear traces of foreignprobably spanishinfluences and some must be accepted as translations those which are of unmistakably home growth are like the comedies of the author more noticeable for licence than for any other quality in the king of bantam which is the most original as well as the most amusing the action is placed in a world such as we meet with in wycherley and the story exhibits the manner in which people represented as perfectly worthy and estimable and of established position plot successfully to extort from a rich and foolish dupe a portion for a deserving but dowerless maiden were anything new to be said concerning the immorality prevalent in restoration times justification for it might be herein found t with the life and writings generally of mrs behn it is superfluous to concern ourselves her plays a further reprint of which would be welcome constitute her chief claim to literary rank a few of her poems have won recognition her  love in fantastic triumph sat is in the best of recent anthologies and one or two other pieces such as her elegiac verses on waller have won recognition mrs benns unsavoury reputation is warranted it is probable however that less would have been heard concerning her delinquencies had scotts story concerning the old lady

  the archdeacon by l b walford pear son all students of fiction are familiar enough with the device of the preliminary chapter or prologue whereby the reader is put in possession of facts that may be essential to the due comprehension of the story proper mrs walford has adopted a curious variation of this method she too has indulged in a prologue in which the archdeacon is but an undergraduate only the prologue occupies more than half the book and forms almost a complete story in itself indeed we have in recent times seen many far more fragmentary tales discharged as complete stories at a longsuffering public then comes a gap of twenty years and the undergraduate reappears as a dignitary of the order which the title of the book denotes in his former capacity he has fallen in love with the first girl with whom he has ever come in contact for he belonged to a class of undergraduates less common we suspect twenty years ago than nowthe young men at once shy and  superior who doubtful of their power to impress society at large with their own estimate of their merits make a show of indifference to it and more especially to the feminine portion of it however he is fairly caught on the first opportunity but a worldlywise acquaintance intervenes goodness knows whyand scarlet fever aiding theobald yorke and the young lady drift apart and meot no more till he is the archdeacon and she a wealthy widow formerly she was the frivolous creature of society he the dreamer with high ideals now if we make allowance for the fact that their years have doubled the parts are exchanged he is a polished and cynical man of the world as the archdeacon of fiction is apt to be she is a woman whom trouble has taught to think and so the issue is joined as will be seen the theme offers possibilities which would not be beneath the notice of a stronger craftsman than mrs walford she has made a fairly attractive tale but hardly more chester the worldlywise acquaintance above mentioned is not exactly convincing one knows the kind of man mrs walford has in her mind but he would not behave that way it is always hard to keep the manners of two periods especially recent periods clear but we would suggest that the bicycle was not a universal adjunct to the biped twenty years ago nor was it called a bike nor would the most slangy of schoolboys have talked about lydies nor again had sanitary science taught us that the avoidance of infection took precedence of all social or friendly duties after all mrs walford has only done what many historians do in projecting modern culture into a semicivilized past,englishfiction_contra

norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale barton cathcart is the son of a farmer who had from a small beginning worked his way to a position of independence and comparative wealth and from this father barton inherits the strong new england spirit of pride energy and force of character modified by a trait of melancholy derived from his mother his sister alicesilent shy and gentleis until the last vohune little better than a lay figure serving as a foil to the brilliancy of her friend rose wentworth the daughter i of the village doctor who himself plays no mean part in  the drama around these twobarton and roseare col  lected various persons who have little indeed to do with j the furtherance of the plot but not one of whom we would 1 be willing to have left out they are as the seasoning to i the dish barton goes to college without any disclosure of 1 his feelings for rose returning to the village only for occa  sional vacations meanwhile she grows up to womanhood i her character formed partly by her fatheran idealist j owning a sympathy with all things animate and inanimate and partly by her fathers housekeeper agate bisselin  every respect the counterpart of miss ophelia in  uncle 1 toms cabin the same conscientiousness the same in  dustry and the same untiring energy which marked that i indefatigable lady rose under this training became as  near perfection as is possible for mortals barton finally i returns from college to take the head of the norwood ara i demy but rn such a state of religious doubt as to prevent j his speaking to roseunwilling to unsettle her peace of mind by confessing his doubts and yet too honourable to conceal them in the meantime frank esel boses artistcousin and tom heywood a young southern gentleman bid fair to become rivals of barton and indeed in the case of frank bose takes the rather doubtful step of refusing him before he proposes heywood is one of the bestdrawn characters in the booka perfect contrast in all things to bartonfair aristocratic with a sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a gentleman wants a decorous faith a good plain sensible worship and then with a good conscience he turns to the enjoyment of life leaving to the deity andexcuse meto the yankees the management of unfathomable mysteries he makes little progress with rose but the arrows aimed for her find their mark in alice cathcart and she learns to love the bright young southerner an accident which happened while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely broken in upon by the news of the bombardment of fort sumter and we have an animated description of the rapidity with which the war summons was answered our friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a representation of american inner life we can thoroughly

lamias winterquarters mildvery mild by alfred austin poet laureate macmillan 9s exactly but enough surelyperhaps somewhat too muchof that subject and our little horses are ringing a carillon with their bells as if to remind us it is time we were again on our way  one moment said lamia raising her hand deprecatingly  beforo we quit this fair 3pot of rest in southern air grace must be said for our al fresco repast you know what form we like that grace to take be it as brief as you will but it must be in verse we are not in sicily he said  nor am i theocritus but veronica asked me the other day if i could give her some idea of the short pastoral idylls written two thousand years ago which not all of us can read but of which all of us have heard i am not so presumptuous as to suppose i have succeeded in responding adequately to her wish but perhaps our almost sicilian surroundings and the indulgent temper of the hour may confer on the attempt something of the appropriateness it would otherwise lack the latter speaker of formal antiquated sentences was the poet and his audience consisted of veronica his wife lamia a young unmarried woman and the chronicler of the party who figures throughout as i  four personages who will be familiar to readers of the garden that i love and in veronicas garden and we have placed this passage at the head of our article because it is typical of the authors curiously oldfashioned manner of recording conversationsa mixture of the leading article and mrs opie why he should thus put back the clock we have no conception we cannot believe that there are readers today who favour in dialogue a return to the diffuse and artificial periods of our forefathers crispness and terseness have surely proved their case yet here is mr austin the titular head of english letters clothing his sentiments in copious and uncomfortable brocades that we hoped had long since been motheaten beyond recovery it is peculiarly odd because in the lyrics which are scattered through this volume mr austin keeps luminously and directly to the point indeed so careless is much of though prose so fluent and haphazard and journalistic that one cannot help feeling the author has considered it of inferior importance to the verses  they are the jewels the prose is merely the setting which does not really matter may easily have been his contention hence such an ugly phrase as  the purchaser alone gets any delectation out of them   such tautology as  a kindred need of this kind  and the verbosity of the whole everyone knows that it is more facile to be verbose than succinct we do not mean to say that lamias winter quarters is actually badwe do not consider that it isbut its lack of distinction in workmanship and the total absence of any vivacity any animating spirit any gaiety makes its triviality too noticeable such booksthe record of a family partys sojourn in a villa of tuscany must necessarily deal with trivial matters because domestic details are always trivial and the conversation of travelling companions usually so but there is a method of so treating the trivial that the result is literature mr austin has however not mastered it lamias winterquarters has all the machinery of a charming book and is yet without charm the poet is a bore he is selfconscious and pontifical he is often a prig veronica is dull and a near relative of mrs grundy lamia is meant to be a revelation of beauty and winsomeness but instead she has the skittishness of a governess at a picnic she is arch in the early victorian way she would tap you with her fan she gives the impression that she might even say with a giggle you naughty man and surely mr austin never intended that she tells the chronicler that he will never understand women she asks will it be very unromantic to seem hungry  adding  because if it wouldas i should not like to hurt anyones feelingsi can sat the edge of appetite with bare imagination of a feast or at most with the unsubstantial pageant of a mandarin orange subsequently it may be mentioned the party indulged in the pleasant and perfectly safe satisfaction of their appetite now such things as these we hold are not matter for a book they are only in place in an essay entitled our winter in tuscany read before a provincial essay society after subtracting these passages there is still a quantity of serious disquisition on a number of conversational topics but mr austin has not the art or the genius for taking pains to make it good reading the authors verse however is in pleasant contrast to his prose it has brightness and clarity as of old he shows too great facility in dropping into mere rhymed catalogues of natural phenomena but as these lists are lists of flowers and birds and beasts which are associated in our minds with rural contentment we like them they bring fragrant and delectable memories thus  goodnight now dwindle wan and low the embers of the afterglow and slowly over leaf and lawn is twilights dewy curtain drawn the slouching vixen leaves her lair and prowling sniffs the telltale air the frogs croak louder in the dyke and all the trees seem dark alike the bee is drowsing in the comb the sharded beetle hath gone home  good night the book has illustrations which appear to be engravings of photographs they are vividly bright and sunny and are excellent examples of their art but they are all too large for the page and give the book an awkward air but this we take it is not the fault of mr austin,englishfiction_contra
  new novels the god of clay by h c bailey hutchinson  co mr baileys new book by reason of its subject and its allotment into consecutive chapters ranks we suppose as a novel yet it is hardly that being an episodic resume of napoleons career as visualised by the imagination the thread of interest remains in the person of bonaparte who connects the tales the authors writing is forceful but he is still too abrupt and spasmodic a trick that came in with mr kipling fortiter in re characterises him but not suaviter in modo his writing is at times brilliant and he manages to carry you along with him however reluctant you may be you want to protest to point out that this thing could not have happened to demur to that astounding assumption to plead that he has not adequately explained that the puzzle remains that women do not do these things half a score of objections you would like to raise  but you have no time mr bailey rushes you along and never heeds and since you are genuinely interested in his narratives you give up and follow humbly out of a mass of incredible events and incidents which mr bailey does not even condescend to explain emerges nevertheless a vivid and powerful and faithful portrait of napoleon the form of this work we imagine was dictated by serial necessities which have hampered the author but the matter proves as we have pointed out before that he is in the forefront of our historical novelists,englishfiction_contra

was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the year round began the publication of the story without waiting to have  quite alone by george augustus sb three tolumes london chapom hall the whole of the manuscript in their hands mr sala did his best to finish the task he had set himself but failed  page by page he says  like so many drops of blod about two hundred slips of manuscript oozed from me between spring and summer they were written with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and sudden death in the month of august i brose down altogether and the mails went out without any of my tissue paper i had lost the thread of my narrative i had forgotten the very names of my dramatis pcrsowa i was in a new countrya new world among strange scenes and strange people hurrying from place to place badgered and hated always abused often in peril of my life and under all hazard compelled to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed it many steps beyond the outset from first to last the heroinewhose mysterious isolation suggests the title of the novelis the character of whom the reader is permitted to see and know least though it is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year round mr sala invites us to do so in fact promising that if a second edition of the book should be called for he will himself finish it according to his original intention as the story at present stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end clubloungers from the circumstance that she is constantly seen in all places of fashionable resort  quite alone this solitary young woman is the daughter of one francis blunt a roul who has squandered a handsome fortune and taken to

the way up the state of the novelist of today is peculiarly happy there is no modern thackeray or dickens to overawe him there is an enormous public prepared to demand his works at the circulating library if he is so fortunate as to please the popular taste  there are critics major and minor anxious to shine in reflected glory by being first in the field to discover great merit or even great promise and while the standard of the best publishing houses is high a novel must be very bad indeed not to find acceptance at the hands of one of those firms that seem to exist only for the purpose of purveying indifferent fiction it is not to be wondered at therefore that innumerable men women aye and those who are little more than children rush if not always into print at least into the production of manuscript yet while so much that is written and published is unworthy of notice it is nevertheless a fact that there has not been a period in the history of english letters when the average merit of novels was so high as it is now indeed it is not too much to say that if a reader knows   the way up by mi p willcocks 6s john lane how to pick his fiction he can find enough really good books in that branch of literature issued every year to occupy all his leisure he will not find a mir strudge a  kings mirror or a  beloved vagabond  at each dip in the luckybag of the circulating library but it is odds that he will get a readable novel since the retirement of mr hardy mr anthony hope mr percy white and m1r locke have held the bridge against all comers but they arc year by year being reinforced by newcomers among whom may be mentioned the authors of  broke of covenden  joseph vance  the man of property and  heather the only womanwriter who can be classed with these rising hopes of english fiction is miss willcocks who in the last five years has published  the wingless victory  widdicombe and a man of genius no critic  discovered  her but a publisher mr john lane who has a gift for finding meritorious unpublished writers of fiction in  the wingless victory  and  widdicombe both of which were popular successes there was much to please the critical as wvell as the uncritical reader there was a welltold story in each book and admirable characterdrawving in both praise could also be given to a man of genius though this work was not so convincing as its predecessors notwithstanding it showed a marked improvement in technique in  tle way up  miss willcocks has taken a broader canvas than she has before used upon which to paint her picture and up to a certain point in the story it is the best work she has ever done we feel her absolute mastery of the story and of the characters up to that point the point where she brings her heroine to london it would appear that the author has no inside knowledge of stageland wherein the heroine deports herself during the last chapters and the descriptions of the theatrical characters and of the theatrical atmosphere are far removed from life all that part is unreal this is to be deplored because of the great merit of the earlier part of the story the characterisation is particularly good michael strode the hero is especially wellconceived as a young man he sacrifices fortune without a pang in order to have opportunities to study the lot of the workman by himself labouring in a factory as  a hand  and as a middleaged man he is still filled with enthusiasm to improve the condition of the class whose interests he had made his own though he has married a wealthy wife he insists on living in a small house in the workmens quarter and it is his one ambition to make over the factory he owns acquired with his wifes money to the workmen to run for their own benefit he is so absorbed in his calculations and in his theories that he alienates the wife who was devoted to him and never attracts the only child of the marriage the wife too is happily depicted a pleasureloving minx whose love of gaiety and society is long held in check by her affection for her husband but the greatest character is michael strodes mother mrs strode is a figure that lingers in the memorya largehearted broadminded woman who loves her son and miracle of miracles in a mother sees him as he is with all his faults as well as with all his virtues she is cast in a large mould and in conceiving her the author has shown herself possessed of a very genuine gift of creation other characters deserve more consideration than space allows mrs lesueur cecily strode aviolet john pym and his wife are all real flesh and blood and assist to make the story very real indeed in spite of what has been said about the later chapters  the way up  is a book that no reader of novels should pass by and one which may not be ignored by that smaller public that is interested in the development of the newer school of writers of fiction lewis melville  the way up by m p willcocks john lane all the characters in this novel talk and act so as to interest us yet not so as entirely to exclude an uncomfortable doubt whether they talk and act as people do in real life they are grouped round a philanthropist who employs

fallacy of ghosts dreams and omens with stories of witchcraft life in death and i monomania by charles ollier au thor of  ferrers c london 1848 ollier ti i s is the antipodes of mrs crow es night side of nature airs crowe approaches her subject with a conviction that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and with so much faith in spiritual appearances as amounts to an admission that  there is something in it and an endeavour to treat the matter philosophically mr oilier sets himself to the task with a predetermination to negative the conclusion and with intent to disprove the assertions of those whom he terms the credulous it must be admitted that mr oilier is clever and smart and if ghosts are to be written down his pen will do it he not only collects all the established arguments against the supposed communications of the spiritual with the material world but he puts them in the most telling shape and where argument is wanting he is prompt with fun which is perhaps even more effective with the general public who prefer the pleasure of a laugh to the labour of thought now there can be no doubt that very few ghoststories will bear close examination and the fact is undeniable that a ghost never a ppears to the sceptical and healthy even the instances collected by mrs crowe are not satisfactory it is impossible for a cautious man to accept the 6xistence of ghosts as a fact upon any evideace yet adduced we do not venture a step beyond this we cannot dogmatically assert our unbelief because no plausible reason is or can be assigned why there should not be communing between the world of spirit and the world of flesh on the contrary the presumption would be not only that it is possible but probable that is to say such will be the conclusion of those who admit the extence of spirit and acknowledge a future state the only question is if it has been estbiehed as a fact and to that we must reply in the words of the scotch verdict not proven it is otherwise with dreams second eight presentiments and such like of these there is abundant evidmce as matters of fact and the difficulty lies in accounting for them by any other means than reference to agency which is usually called supernatural but which would be more properly termed abnormal because it is not a violation of any natural law but the operation of an existing law that is called into action only in certain conditions of mind and body the attempts to explain away these prophetic promptings of the soul by the easy assertion that they are accidental coincidences will not bear a moments reflection such coincidences cannot be accidental according to any known calculation of probabilities there is infinity to one against them and they occur too often and with too many persons and under circumstances too remarkable to be answered by reference to chance but what is chance  nothing more than the result of laws which we have not taken into our calculation in truth there is no such thing as chance every event is the necessary consequence of certain fixed laws and might be predicated with certainty if we had the capacity to grasp and trace them if then the coincidences in question are the result of fixed laws have we a right to assume that there is no meaning in them that the author of nature i affixed to them no purpose and that we are to treat them with disregard and contempt would it not be more philosophical to investigate them carefully with intent to ascertain if the soul have not even while in this its tenement of clay the power under certain conditions of the body to which it is linked of communicating with the spirit world and of obtaining by a kind of intuition knowledge which cannot be procured through the circumscribed media of the bodily senses and that this knowledge it is but how obtained we cannot tell which we term presentiment second sight dreams and which it perplexes us to account for because we have no memory of the circumstances under which it was obtained  it appears to us that this is the philosophical view of the question which has occupied so many pens pro and con and in this manner we should like to have seen it treated by mr ollier who has skill in writing to make philosophy popular we note as an instance of the sort of grtuitous assumption with which mr oilier has sought to explain away facts his account of the murder at dundry which was discovered by too persons having dreamed on the same night that the body was deposited in a certain well and mr oilier assumes that there can be little doubt that the general opinion among the deceaseds servants wvas that their master was murdered now this is a pure supposition and the fact was otherwise we were present at the trial and made very particular inquiry into the circumstances from the witnesses and the truth was that up to the time of finding the body in the well at the earnest entreaty of the men who had dreamed that it was concealed there not the slightest suspicion of murder had been entertained by any person in the family or out of it it was supposed that the farmer had either killed himself or died in a fit therefore it was that nobody thought it worth while to examine a dry well covered by a huge stone which it required two men to lift hence there was not in the minds of the dreamers anything that could have led their sleeping thoughts to the well besides if they had suspected murder why did not the well suggest itself to their waking thoughts when actually on the premises searching and it was before their eyes  it is at least an extraordinary fact that two persons should have chanced to have the same dream in itself a marvellous accident on the same night such combinations of accident would be more wonderful than the fact itself and more hard to believe than the explanation which we confess presents itself to our mind i as that which is the rationale of this and all  other revelations of the same kind namely that the state of mind and body which in mesmerism calls forth that faculty of perception beyond the range of the senses which we term clairvoyance exists also in certain other states of body and mind that one of the conditions under which this species of perception occurs is thati the attention should be intensely fixed upon the object that in the case under consideration there was the condition of attention fixed upon the object namely the missing farmer that in sleep the state of mind and body occurred wvhich permits of perception by other than the media of the bodily senses and then the object vas perceived by the sleepers and remembered by them as a dream it is a phenomenon every day witnessed in persons in a state of mesmerism and there is no reason why the faculty should not be developed in other states wve have little doubt indeed that when the subject comes to be investigated by a series of close observations it will be found that this faculty which is called clairvoyanee is possessed by nal of us but developed only in certain states of mind or body more frequently however than we at present ha ve any suspicion of we are not sure that many of the thoughts and much of the knowledge we possess is not obtained by means of this facultynay we are inclined to believe that all of that mysterious intelligence which we term instinct is to be traced to the same source but this is too large a subject to enter upon here for the present we close mr olliers book having derived from it much amusement and with a hope that lie will be induced to look more profoundly into the subject and employ his great abilities to its elucidation rather than to an endeavour to laugh it down the papers collected in this volume originally appeared in ainsworths m1agazine and that will account for their somewhat gossiping tone,englishfiction_contra
zbe izookinais table my friends book by anatole france translated by j lewis may 6s john lane my friends book  is not one of anatole frances most interesting or important works but that it possesses distinction and charm goes without saying it is in main the recollections of a man about his childhood and upbringing the life of a small parisian of the nineteenth century is shown us with that delicacy of touch and emotion with that kind of faint hint of gentle irony for which anatole france is so famous there is little plot in the story  in fact there is no plot at all in one sense the tale just winds along through the remembered episodes of youth here bright with the curious precise details of memory there hazy with the usual lapses of recollection the psychology of children has a singular attraction for anatole france probably it is that his own memories are peculiarly vivid and that all his books on childhood are to a large extent sheer autobiography the exquisite and cunning ease of his style is an almost perfect medium for so simple a story as this a child might read  my friends book  with delighta delight that would be shared by the most cultured people there is always in anatole france an ironic reserve which is very piquant you never quite know whether his tongue is not in his cheek one need only read the long conversation at the end of this book between octave laure and raymond upon the subject of fairy tales to be conscious of the feeling that vague suggestion of a mocking smile that hovers over all his work gives it a rare flavour that is all its own gives it a subtle and almost indefinable personality you might as well try to explain why it is that certain rooms affect one so queerly or certain scents or certain silences even and what makes anatole france especially fascinating is the fact that his mockery is so kindly that you never quite know whether it is mockery it is as elusive as a name that is on ones lips but will not shape itself into a word this translation appears to be competently made but of course any translation of a french stylist loses some precious essence which simply cannot survive in an alien tongue that is a sad but undeniable truth,englishfiction_contra

white and black a story of the southern states new novels 3 vols hurst  blackett england has pretty well recorded her views upon slaver there are various ways of testing a mans practical faith in his own opinions no belief can get itself established until it hos had martyrs who have dared to die for it people have ventured to suffer shame ignominy and the loss of all things sooner than depart from what they believe to be right short of these extreme testimonies but still a tolerably sharp practical test of a mans sincerity in his profession of faith is his willingness to pay down an inconveniently large sum of ready money for it men may sign bills as they run up bills without realising the fact but to pay ready money is a dead lift out of a mans pocket about which there is no charming illusion except in those oldfashioned plays where mr t p cooke as a sailor on shore representing the old british navy used to take out a long purse stuffed at each end with soidisant bank notes and guineas and hand it with an inimitable heartiness saying  here messmate take this it is prizemoney taken by the timbuctoo and his virtue was enthusiastically rewarded by the whole house but when it comes to paying the consciencemoney to a gruff stoneyvisaged taxcollector who never says or feels a  thank you kindly then paying for a principle sustains a tolerably strong test for everyday wear and tear now england has done this and more than this to express her detestation and abhorrence of slavery  and england more than any other nation has that quality which jockeys call stay in a horse and without which no generous enthusiasm is worth more than a flash in the jiangood to kindle but worthless for warmth now what england bas done once she can hold on by in all its consequences without weariness or fickleness the hatred of slavery by englishmen is a thing said and done and settled we have no more enthusiasm to bestow upon it all that goes now to feed our persistence in our opposition to it we do not talk about itwe do not discuss itbut we continue to pay taxes to suppress it wherever we find it whilst doing this like britons we must enter an emphatic protest against being bored with it in our novels and books of amusement exquisite white heroines who somehow turn out to be black in the course of the story and so can legally be treated as if they were tables or chairs or dogs or horses areto be pitied and we do pity them and we have pitied them accordingly but when under the pretence of amusing us we are presented with three volumes full of abolition speeches and details of all that a delicatelynurtured and highlyeducated young lady must feel who having been brought up as an heiress and in ignorance that she has isegro blood in her veins ami whose father is a furious brute who to revenge himself on an abolitionist sells his daughter down southor to have details of all the domestic misery jealousy and cruelty which the female quadroon slaves bring to the lawful wives may be all very true  but it is a great bore to listen to a sermon on doctrines we have lived by and accepted absolutely for years  precher un converti is the deadliest infliction that human ingenuity can devise short of bodily torment white and black is a good sensible novel of the kind the arguments and illustrations are all of our own persuasion irene is a heroine who is very troublesome to her friends and who might have kept out of all the adversities and dangers which befell her if in the beginning she had listened to advice and used some common sense but as she was predestined by the author to point his moral and adorn his arguments of course she could not help it she was born to ill luck we confess to feeling great sympathy with chauncy burgoyne the fine highspirited planter who becomes converted to abolitionist views and loses his life in their defence the story is as well done as a story of the kind can be but we protest against being dragged through details ofthe evils of slavery from brutal floggings to more brutal love besides which our sympathy for irene is entirely destroyed by the last pagi in the book which casts a doubt on her ever having been good for anything it may be that death has already removed the bonds of the young american girl it may be that she still lins degradtd brokenhearted we can only feel that if she could live degraded after allhehad known and feltand the sacrifices of noble lives that had been made for her she deserved her fate the slavequestion is avenging iself fearfully at this moment in america the halfhearted north is trying to go two ways at once in regard to slavery it wants all the credit of repudiation and all the convenience of cottongrowing slaves freed by othrs it degrades men of colour and makes their condition to the utmost generation that of pariahs pretends to afford them liberty whilst it insults them as human beings has the north dared to accept its own principles and act mi them  has it dared even to right for its belief in the right of slaves to freedom i and fighting for a point is the very easiest and most primitive form of faith in conclusion we beg to enter our own protest against antislavery literature the perverseness of human nature is great and a few more books like uncle toms cabin and  white and black would go far towards turning the current in favour of the masters instead of the slaves,englishfiction_contra
the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the author succeeded in the delineation  the queens manes a romauce of holyrood by g j whyte mielvle two tols parker so  bourn of historical character on the contrary the representatiobs which appear on his canvas are daubs or caricatures the wise and politic rtandolpha worthy ambassador even for queen elizabethbecomies a conceited dancingmaster the character of bothwell has been borrowed from the pretentious doggerel which mvr aytoun published some years ago under the name of a poem the borderer is delineated as from the first the unselfish lover of his queen  anl the brutality and cowardice which he displayed when he hat won the object of this pure devotion are glossed over in grandiloquent and meaningless sentences such as these 1the nman who would once have shed his hearts blood freely to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work there is nothing in the booknot even incident instead of the usual huntingfield with its impossible leaps we have a hawkingparty on the links of saint andrews composed of the queen and john knox than which we never read of anything more absurd these two volumes in short are as dull less authentic and far more lengthy than any record of the same period they have nothing of the novel but unreality

lyra nicotiana the pipe and the muse edited by w g hutchinson  canterbury poets  series walter scott although though stimulus and friend of many a poet tobacco has we may say at starting inspired little good verse in praise of itself these lyrics of pipe and cigar snuff and cigarette are for the most part very trifling affairs good smokers do not talk about tobacco much less rhyme a pipe is poem enough there are of course exceptions such as mr lowell and mr henley and mr leland but in the main it is the enthusiastic but inexperienced young who hymn the weed tobacco makes for reticence for contemplation tobacco is an oriental grave and sedentary silent and content this little book is a piece of western restlessness and frivolity the best thing in it is undoubtedly mr henleys rondeau  if i were king    if i were king my pipe should be premier the skies of time and chance are seldom clear we would inform them all with bland blue weather delight alone would need to shed a

should appear if i were king i less well known but not much less excellent is the same poets  inter sodales    over a pipe the angel of conversation loosens with glee the tassels of his purse and in a fine spiritual exaltation hastens a very spendthrift to disburse the coins new minted of imagination an amiable a delicate animation informs our thought and earnest we rehearse the sweet old farce of mutual admiration over a pipe heard in this hours delicious divagation how soft the song the epigram how terse with what a genius for administration we rearrange the rambling universe and map the course of mans regeneration over a pipe both these poems by the way are more than twenty years old mr henley is represented in all by eight pieces seven of which specifically belaud the pipe a meerschaum for preference it is therefore a little odd to find him figuring in the frontispiece with a cigarette between his fingers mr lowell also praised the meerschaum   the pipe came safe and welcome too as anything must be from you  a meerschaum pure twould float as light as she the girls call amphitrite mixture divine of foam and clay from both it stole the best away its foam is such as

immortal form the typo and very venus of a pipe and though meerschaum has othor adherents and eulogists among mr hutchinsons poets on the other hand though late mr r f murrays  ballade of the best

too alarming cigars cheroots and cigarettes come in for celebration but in the main the book is the book of though pipe as to brands of tobacco the poets are not explicit mr t b aldrich like the late james payn explains that he is addicted to latakia  but the question is left vague by his brother bards we cannot consider that mr hutchinson has done his work particularly well the number of pieces with no signature to thom or any indication of origin is much too large and considering how easy it is to trace the authorship of verses that appear in reputable newspapers it is a sign of carelessness on mr hutchinsons part that he appends to certain selections only  the globe  the st jamess gazette and so i on though editors of these journals would 1 have f urnished though names of their con1 tributors with pleasure again mr hutchinsons notes are very scant in the other anthologies included in the canterbury poets particularly in the case of the sonnets of the century collected by mr william sharp the general editor of the series the notes have been full and interesting but mr hutchinson has only thirteen to a volume of over two hundred and fifty pages there are cases where notes are positively needed or deserved there is a piece of blank verso by mr leland for example inscribed  to w g h ie mr w g hutchinson which we imagine was written especially for this volume  but

accompanied by so clear an exhibition of its structure and laws all comprised within such moderate limits he has done well in introducing so much ofthe anglosaxon grammar as is needful to enable the reader to trace the origin of our inflexions and study our older writers with advantage this we think a valuable feature as also the chapter on etymology the hints on composition too with the quotations from standard authors for the purpose of illustration and the appendix of exercises and questions add much to the practical utility of the manual we have noticed one or two errors which may be corrected in subsequent editions the hackneyed quotation from shakspeare  who steals my purse steals trash is here printed he that steals c the difference is not material but in

of intellectual culture in the hands of a competent instructor to acquire a critical knowledge of english the several elements of which it is composed the relative proportions of each the changes that they have undergone and the way in which they were at first introduced and have since amalgamated together demands a good deal of patient investigation add to this a thorough comprehension and ready command of all the terms of the language and it will at once be evident that no englishman can be really master of his language without having gone through a course of study beneficial as a discipline of thc mind and  fraught with information which a due regard j to national feeling must make him anxious to  receive the deficiency of inflections the numerous anomalies and the other imperfections which may be considered drawbacks to our tongue as a means of education are more than counterbalanced by thc fact of its being our tongue and spreading over so vast a portion of the inhabited world no man has done more than dr latham to place the study of english on its proper footing by his philosophical treatment of it he lins raised it to the dignity which it deservesand shown that while an essential in the earliest education of children it is not unworthy to hold a high place in college pursuits his present work is a sort of medium between his large and school grammars it is rendered much more interesting as well as more useful to a student than the school grammar by containing not merely a greater number of facts but also a more copious discussion of principles nnd a fuller explanation of though origin and reasons of particular usages on though other hand it is less abstruse and more practical than the large work on the english languageit begins with an account ofthe  general ethnological relations ofthe english language followed by a  history and analysis of thc english language this portion of the volume contains much historical and ethnological information it also describes the leading characteristics of the tongue at different periods and points out some of the tendencies of the present agc then folio about fifty pages on  sounds letters pronunciation spelling in which we find a complete list of all the simple sounds with their various combinationssome excellent remarks on the alphabet its history deficiencies and redundancies  the laws which regulate the changes of letters in different connexions and the reasons on which these laws are founded with an explanation of accent and quantity the next part treats of etymology and occupies a much larger space dr latham having previously explained the principles on which though changes ot letters rest is enabled to make the reader easily understand how the apparently anomalous forms of the plural number have originated as the possessive case is not generally understood correctly wc will cite what is here stated on the subject thu true nature rf thc ge nitrc  ins it isa ciinmon notion that t o giiive for fa tit cres is contracted from father li though  xsioit in our iryoi jesus christ his te which i nur ly a pleonastic one is the only touaduion fur tins assertion as the idea however is not only one ofthe commonet but also one of thc greatest errors in etymology though following three statements are given for the sake of contradiction to it 1 the expression the queens majesty is not capable of being reduced to thc queen his majesty 2 in the form his itself thc s has pn ciely the power that it has in fathers c now his cannot be said to arise out of at f his 3 in the slavonic lithuanic and classical tongues the genitive ends in s just as it does in english  so that even if the words father his would account for the english wori fathers it woutd not account for the sanskrit genitive pad as of a foot though zend dvghdhars of a daughter the lithuanic dugtcrs the greek 6zovtoq  though latin dentis cc the whole of this subject of etymology is handled in a most masterly manner all peculiarities of inflexion are carefully considered and if possible traced to their true origin or referred to some general law it is wonderful how few inexplicable anomalies are allowed to remain after dr latham has brought his powerful analysis to bear upon them by making free use of the anglosaxon and occasionally of other languages he gives the reader a thorough insight into all the varieties of inflexion and formation his account of the verb is highly instructive syntax and prosody are the topics discussed in the remainder of the work   the former naturally engrossing by far the greatest share of attention here too a truly philosophical spirit prevails in explaining rules of construction dr latham goes to the root of the matter and shows the dependence of the laws of language upon those of thought he decides in all disputed or doubtful cases by a reference to the idea intended to be conveyed rather than to the external form of the words used we give as an instance the following passage from the chapter on the  concord of verbs  in respect to the concord of person thc following rules will carry us through a portion of the difficulties  littlein sentences where there is but one proposition when a noun and a pronoun of different persons are in apposition the verb agrees with the first of themi your master command you not ctmmanils  your master i commands you not command  to understand the nature of the difficulty it is necessary to remember that subjects may be extremely complex as well as perfectly simple and that a complex subject may contain at one nnd the same time u noun substantive and a pronoun the keeper he the merchant c now all nounsubstantives are naturally of the third personjohn speaks the men run the commander gives orders consequently the verb is of the third person also but the pronoun with which such a nounsubstantive may be placed in apposition may be a pronoun of either person the first or second  i or thoui the commanderthou the commanderin this case the construction requires consideration with which does the verb agree with the substantive which requires a third person  or with the pronoun which requires a first or second  undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leading idea  and undoubtedly the idea which explains qualifies or defines it is the subordinate idea and undoubtedly it is the leading idea which determines thc construction of the verb we may illustrate this from the analogy of a similar construction in respect to numbera man with a horse and a gig meets me on the road here though ideas are three  nevertheless the verb is singular no addition of subordinate elements interferes with the construction that is determined by the leading idea in the expression i your master the ideas are two ti the idea expressed by 7 aud the idea ixprcsed by master neveithcless as the one only explains or defines th othu the corstnution is the sime is if the idea were hai your hiashr i is in the same condition the gmia statement is made concerning the matter and it is intended to say what he does the word  merely defines the expression by stating who the master is ofthe two expressions the latter is the awkwardest the construction however is the same for both from the analysis of the structure of complex subjects of the kind in question combined with a rule concerning the position of the subject which will soon be laid down i believe that for all single propositions the foregoing rule is absolute pulein all single propositions the verb agrees in person with the noun whether substantive or pronoun which conies first  but the expression it is i your master who command or commands you is not a single proposition it is a sentence containing two propositions 1 it is i 2 who command iou here the word master is so to say undistributed it may belong to either clause of the sentence ie the whole sentence may be divided into eitherit is i your master oryour master vho commands you this is the first point to observe the next is that the verb in the second clause command orcommands is governed not by either the personal pro noun or the substantive but by the relativeje in the particular case before us not by either or master but by who and this brings us to the following questionwith which ofthe two antecedents does the relative agree  with  or with master  this maybe answered by the two following rulespule 1when the two antecedents are in the same proposition though relative agrees with the first thus 1 it is  your master 2 who comma nd you pule 2when the two antecedents are in different propositions the relative agrees with the second thus 1 it u i 2 your matter who command you this however is not all what determines whether the two antecedents shall be in the same or in dif fcrent propositions i believe that the following rules for what may be called the distribution of the substantive antecedent will bear criticism  pule 1that when there is any natural connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the second clause thus in the expression just quoted the word master is logically connected with the word command nnd this fact makes the expression it is i your master who commands you the better of the two pule 2that when there is no natural connexion between the substantive antecedent nnd the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the first clause it is i john who command not commands you  to recapitulate the train of reasoning has been as follows1 the person of the second verb is the person of the relative 2 the person of the relative is that of one of two antecedents 3 of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the one which stands in the same proposition with itself 4 which position is determined by the connexion or want of connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative  respecting the person of thc verb in thers proposition of a complex sentence there is no doubt  your master who commands you to make haste am not is in a hurry here i am in a h wry is the first proposition who commands you to make haste the second it is not difficult to see why the construction of sentences consisting of two propositions is open to an amount of latitude which is not admissible in the construction of single propositions as long as the different parts of a complex idea are contained within the limits of a single proposition their subordinate character is easily discerned when however they amount to whole propositions they take the appearance of being independent members of the sentence with regard to the use of the subjunctive mood dr latham lays down the simple principle that whenever both conditionality and uncertainty are impliedno matter what conjunction or pronoun or other part of speech is employedthen and then only the verb must be in the subjunctive mood we have a little doubt as to the correctness of what follows whenever two or more pronouns of different persons and of the singular number follow each other disjunctively the question of concord arises  or youyou or hehe or i i believe that in these cases the rule isas follows1 whenever the words either or neither precede the pronouns the verb is in the third person either you or i is in the wrong neither you nor i is in the wrong 2 whenever the disjunctive is simple ie unaccompanied with the word either or neither the verb agrees with the first ofthe two pronouns  or he am in the wrong he or  it in the wrong thou or he art in the wrong lie or thou is in the wrong we need only say in conclusion that the english student is deeply indebted to dr latham for this valuable addition to his labours,englishfiction_contra
selections from the writings of walter savage landor arranged and edited by sidney colvin  golden treasury  series macmillan a landobian anthology has long been wanted and badly to the many landor has always been more or less unapproachable and has always seemed more or less shadowy and unreal to begin with he wrote for himself and a few others and principally for himself then he wrote waywardly and unequally as well as selfishly  he published pretty much at random the bulk of his work is very urge the editions in which he appears are rare or unwieldy or both and the majority have passed him by for writers more accessible and work less freakish and more comprehensible it is probable too that even among those who inspired by natural temerity or the intemperate curiosity of the general reader have essayed his conquest and set out upon what has been described as  the adventure of the seven volumes which were seven valleys of dry bones only a few have returned victorious of course the seven volumes are a world but it is objected the world is one of a peculiar pattern abounding in antres vast and deserts idle in gaps and precipices and  manifest solutions of continuity and enveloped with sn atmosphere which ordinary lung find now too rare and now too dense and too hypnotic moreovor it is peopled chiefly with abstractions bearing noble and suggestive names but all surprisingly alike in stature and feature all more or less incapable of sustained emotion and even of logical argument all inordinately addicted to superb generalities and a kind of monumental skittishness all expressing themselves in a style whose principal characteristic is a magnificent monotony and all apparently the outcome of a theory that to be wayward is to be creative that human interest is a matter of apophthegms and oracular sentences and that axiomatic and dramatic are identical qualities and convertible terms this is the opinion of those adventurers in whom defeat has generated a sense of injury and an instinct of antagonism others less fortunate still have found landor a continent of dullness and futility have come to consider the seven volumes as so many aggregations of ennui suoh experiences are onesided and partial no doubt and considered from a certain point of view they seem worthless enough but they exist and by existing they are in some sort justified landor when all is said and done remains a writers writer and it is impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with those who hesitate to accept him for anything else the number of those who do sofrom ignorance or distaste or downright stupidity is large it is probable however that by the publication of the present volume their ranks will be thinned perceptibly and their pretensions considerably abated mr colvin is a determined landorian  but his landorism is neither pedantio nor fanatical and has in no wise debauched his humanity his judgement of landorconveyed in a prefatory note which is certainly one of the best of recent yearsis exceptionally generous both in essence and substancetoo generous i think to be final but it is nicely balanced on the whole and strikes a possible mean between the enthusiasm of disdain and the enthusiasm of admiration mr colvin takes cognizance not only of what is good and sound in his author butto a great extentof what is bad and false as well he is quite willing to recognise the fact that the author of landors unpopularity is mainly landor himself and that unique as was landors talent and notable as is landors achievement the world is not altogether to blame for the attitude of indifference it has hitherto maintained to them he claims much for the man and perceives a vast deal in the work but he admits more or less explicitly its many faultsits abruptness its inconsecutiveness its want of tact the unreality of much of it the egotism of all his object has been to produce a landor who shall be generally acceptable a landor that is to say whose blunders shall be corrected and whose better qualities alone shall be in evidence this object he has attained and eminently well planned and brilliantly executed his work is really a model of its kind it takes rank with the best anthologies in english and i cannot choose but believe that it will succeed in conquering for landor an enduring popularity and will remain the textbook of his fame and the proof of his greatness as a writer i have already referred to mr colvins preface i shall add that it contains among other notable passages an analysis of the classic and romantic methods which is comparable with heines own the book proper is divided into three parts the first  dramatic and narrative is subdivided into two sections  of specimens of landor at his best and most coherent as a writer of what it appears to be the proper thing to recognise as  drama and of landor at his best and stateliest as a storyteller and an artist in allegory in the first one is surprised and not pleasantly surprised to find extracts from the  conversation between peter the great and alexiswhich mr colvin obligingly describes as this fierce historic satireand that between fra lippo lippi and pope eugenius which contains some of the worst  comedy  ever perpetrated even by landor the rest of this section has been chosen with perfect tact as has the whole of the second of the second part which is split up into nine subdivisionsof religion of love and human nature of  literature and language and so forth the interest is purely gnomic it is admirably edited and its effect is extraordinary such a hoard of verbal jewelsof maxims cut like gems and sentences that ring like golden oracleshas not before i think been brought together the lustre it reflects upon landor considered merely as an artist in words is remarkable never before have the dignity aud beauty of his style asserted themselves to such purpose  never before has the ocular proof of his genius as a writer appeared so majestic and so overwhelming the third partof extracts  personal and autobiographicalaffects us in a different way before we have only admired here we learn to love before we have dealt with landor the writer here we are brought face to face with landor the man the effect is irresistible mr colvin has performed hi task with infinite delicacy and skill and by selection and arrangement merely has given us a better and a nobler landor than we ever knew before no doubt the landor existed but he existed in seven volumes and his aspect was vague and nebulous his editor may be said to have rescued him from himself to have made him organic and comprehensible and to have set him full in the light of that affectionate immortality which is after all his due i regret that the space at my disposal does not permit me to do more than refer in passing to one or two of what i conceive to be the weak points in mr colvins preface as i think for instance he is grievously mistaken in his estimate of landor as a dramatist and i cannot ohoose but quarrel with his attribution to landor of the gifts of heroic imagination and a sound creative faculty to many of us landors imagination i3 not only inferior in kind but limited in degree his creative faculty is limited by the reflection that its one achievement is landor his claim to consideration as a dramatio writer is negatived by the fact that poignant as are the situations with which he loved to deal he was apparently incapable of perceiving their capacitiesinasmuch as he has failed completely and logically to develop a single one of them inasmuch too as he has never once succeeded in conceiving much less in picturing such a train of conflicting emotions as any one of the complications from which he starts might be supposed to generate to many of us there is nothing greek about his dramatic work but the absence of stage directions  and that quality of  landorian abruptness whioh seems to mr colvin to excuse so many of its shortcomings is identical with a certain sort of what in mea of lesser mould is called stupidity w e henley,englishfiction_contra

  lord of the world by robert hugh benson pitman  son mr benson is always so frankly and enthusiastically ecclesiastical or theological that he disarms criticism in a lay paper he has devoted his genuine literary gifts to the polemics of the roman catholic church and is as prolific a controversialist as that ancient establishment can boast not that he adopts the ordinary methods of breaking a lance with heterodoxies he has always used fiction as a means to the end his latest book is rather an extravagant example of his methods it is an imaginative picture highly coloured of the world at some future date given over to unbelief and utilitarianism in this world the roman catholic church alone survives as a depository of faith and the struggle ends in the practical destruction of the papacy shrinking for refuge to a humble home in nazareth apparently the struggle is signalised by the appearance of a benevolent antichrist but we do not pretend to follow mr benson in these somewhat incoherent imaginings we gather that the book ends with the end of the world judged as fiction it shows that an emotional brain of a distinctive character is behind the writing but its impassioned faith is the prevalent note and everything else is subjected to this,englishfiction_contra

our library table barbaras history by amelia b ed wards 3 vol hurst andl blacken  it i would be impossible for miss edwards to write i anything which should beuninteresting therefore i barbaras history has interest but the story 1 merely serves the purpose of rendering a note ji book of continental travel over beaten tracts  saleable and is not in itself either complicated 1 l or artistically worked out hugh farquhar is a highlyaccomplished gentleman who exhibits a large amount of booklearning conveyed in very clever and brilliant conversations which it would be delightful to listen to for halfanhour but dreadful to endure for any larger portion of ones natural life his conduct moreover is not at all in keeping or upon a par with that of ordinarily decent persons of his ser and the presence of the naughty italian woman under the same roof with his wife is an offence against goodbreeding and good taste which would be simply impossible in real life on the part of such a character the secretdoor in tile library is unworthy the writers inventive power and indeed the whole conception of the incidents to which it leads is faulty and improbable but that portion of barbaras history which occurs previous to her removal from her aunt mrs shakeshaft of stonycroft hall is charmingly told amidst glimpses of english scenery that discover the artist in the author and make those who most desire her success long to find her writing a story that shall rely wholly upon its vraisemblance to realities the most original and bestsustained character in the volumes before us is mrs shakeshaft and wve quite regret to lose her wholly in the second volume and to hear so little of her in the third as for barbaras family the whole might be left out of the book without causing any loss to its interest and with the exception of professor metze the german school is as unproductive of character yet with all its shortcomings barbaras history is replete with evidences of the authors talent clever and brilliant dialogues graphic descriptions of scenery and places with little ripples of wit scintillating here and there and frequent eloquence of language characterise these volumes which have the virtue of retaining the readers interest to the end  barbaras history rn by amelia b edwards tc 3 vols hurst  blackett if miss amelia edwards goes on writing such stories as barbaras history she will on some bright day of a lucky season wake up and find herself famous she hos made great progress since the publication of  the story of cervantes and her other books for children the patient labour of a long apprenticeship has not been without good results to the artist for now that she undertakes to amuse a superior and more critical clas3 of readers she brings to the task qualities necessary for the satisfactory completion of an imaginative work seldom if ever found in inexperienced essayists miss edwards however has qualities superior to mere literary facility and acquaintance with the artifices of her art she has humour insight into character a somewhat extensive knowledge of books and a mind thoroughly feminine in tone but strong enough to pass through fields of thought without leaning on a more powerful intellect wishing to do the lady justice we lay especial stress on our recognition of her strength and ability to stand alone  for while we give her full credit for having written a thoroughly readable and at some points deeply interesting novel we may not omit to state that she is greatly indebted to others for the plot principal characters and general tone of her book we tread on delicate ground and are anxious to avoid misconstruction no eharge of plagiarism is either made or insinuated in what has just escaped us it is quite possible that whilst the author was thinking out her story during quiet country walks and in the silent hours of sleepless nights she never gave a single thought to  david copperfield and  jane eyre a clever shy ugly awkward child of a poor proud selfish gentleman barbara churchill is sent from her dull london schoolroom into suffolk where the little girl has an eccentric aunt named ann shandyshaft a lady of landed property whose whims create laughter for miles around her residence stoneycroft hall the little girls journey from town to suffolk her reception at stoneycroft hall and the character of her relation are extracts from  david copperfield  with a difference little barbaras adventure with the dissenting minister who devours her sandwiches whilst the hungry child looks on feeling herself wronged but unable to defend her rights recalls the scene between david and though waiter in the coffeeroom where the latter drinks off the little fellows ale this is only one of many points of resemblance between barbaras history and copperfields experiences the aunts of the two children are distinguishable only by difference of income and social positionmiss ann shandyshaft being a much grander and wealthier personage than miss betsy trotwoodand by a diversity of taste which impels the latter lady to hunt donkeys and the former to drive pigs the intercourse of the one aunt with her nephew closely resembles that of the other lady with her niece it is however needless to enforce a parallel between the two ladies it is enough to say that it exists and then leave readers to detect for themselves the points of similarity adjoining the estate of stoneycroft hall are the domains of hugh farquhar a gentleman of vast powers and wasted opportunities hugh has travelled read suffered much and scandalised society a good deal more when little barbara crosses his path but though he has seen much of the world he is still a young man his country neighbours think he ought to marry and settle amongst them  but the owner of eleven thousand a year is of another opinion he is a gentleman who scorns social trammels and it is delicately hinted that he nurses a secret sorrow after a years stay in suffolk barbara and the two other principal characters of the tale are separatedaunt shandyshaft sending the child home to her harsh father and hugh farquharthe superb the sumptuous mysterious hughtaking his secret sorrow and flashing eyes to foreign landa after a while barbara is sent to a german college where she distinguishes herself as an artist from this point of the book almost to the end of the story mr dickenss influence ceases to make itself felt and the author works away under inspiration drawn from charlotte brontes novels the life of the german college is the college life of villettewith a difference  barbara no longer a feminine edition of david copperfield becomes a refined spiritualized jane eyre  and hugh farquhar who unexpectedly makes his appearance at the college plays the part of mr rochesteralso with a difference the girl and the man fall fiercely in love with each other but instead of throwing himself at her feet and asking for her hand he strives against a love in the gratification of which lies his only chance of happiness the secret sorrow already hinted at the black mysterious trouble of his days forbids him to make the girl his wife at length the offer is made and he is accepted  but even after matters have reached that point hugh farquhar flies from barbara not daring to marry her in defiance of principle of course the reader assumes that like mr rochester hugh farquhar is already married unable to live away from weird little barbara the tempestuous lover returns and they are married a period of continental travel succeeds the ceremony and after a while hugh reluctantly consents to return to england and settle with his young wife at broomhill as soon as she has entered the old mansion barbara begins to suspect that it contains secret apartments from which she is excluded and a mysterious occupant of those apartments whose acquaintance she is not permitted to make time and accident convert suspicion into knowledge barbara ascertains that a lovely woman is kept in the house of which she herself is mistressa woman of whom her husband has never made mention this is the most exciting part of the story first the reader suspects that hugh like mr rochester has a mad wife shut up in his house then that the mysterious lady is a mistress whom he dares to cherish under the same roof with his wife barbara and hugh at length come to an understanding about the mysterious ladythe husband telling his wife a rigmarole little calculated to impose on so j clever a woman and barbaraclever woman and jealous wife though she isaccepting the flimsy statement but the fire is only deadened i not quenched ere long barbara passing along a gallery overhears her husband in private conversation withins beautiful lodger they are sitting together like lovers the lovely italian woman is passionately reminding hugu of her devotion to him and declaring that barbara will never love him as she maddalena has loved and still loves him pleasant talk this for poor barbara a minute later she hears hugh address the woman as  poa mia barbara stays to listen no longer that same night she flies from broomhill and after sickness and peril makes her way to rome eventually a reconciliation is effected between barbara and her husband  and in order that the heroine may not be censured for pardoning the man who appears to have put upon her the worst affront husband can offer to wife miss edwards covers her hero with so thick and complete a coating of whitewash that there ia not enough darkness left to account for what has taken place in the story it is shown that hugh never married maddalenathe reader thereby learning that his indignation against mr farquhar as a bigamist has been murplaced and that in addition to the pleasurable excitement of reading a good bigamy case he has also the pleasure of discovering that the supposed criminal is innocent the whitewashing goes on it is shown that hugh cannot be said even to have seduced maddalenaaye more that he cannot be said even to have loved her true he was his mistress many years before his marriage  but he was drawn into the affair by pity not love for the woman who threw herself at his feet vowing that she idolised him the process of whitewashing is not yet done it is shown that hugh would have married her if he could have done so  but as her existing marriage with an aged and repulsive husband prevented him from taking that step he promised her never to marry any other woman it is proved also that hugh had long since ceased to give maddalena any special signs of personal favour  and therefore that though he was guilty of indiscretion in harbouring her in though same house with his wife he had in no way been false to his marriage vows it does not seem to strike miss edwards that the statements of this whitewashing part are not only inconsistent with her characters but break down the entire framework of her story it is not very probable that a fastidious refined and highly sensitive mana man without any alloy of physical or moral weaknesswould live with any woman under the circumstances described from motives of commiseration  sensitive men do not love women who throw themselves at their feet and play the part of whipped spaniels licking thc dust off their masters shoes it is simply incredible that a keen flippant sarcastic sceptic like hugh could have bound himself to such a worshipper by an unsought promise never to marry another woman  and even if in a moment of weakness he had given such a promise he most ussuredly would not have regarded it as a valid obligation years after relinquishing personal intercourse with the dishonoured beauty again if that had been the true story of his intimacy with maddalena what reason was there for keeping the matter from barbaras knowledge after he bad married her in fact the apology does too much bringing down the entire structure of the tale with a crash let us however say that we like missedwards all the better for her error con senting to humour the existing taste for bigamy stories she was determined not to make too great a sacrifice of womanly dignity for a consideration she would touch pitch  but pitch white and perfumedpitch which ehe might lay aside with clean hands just as mrs ratcliffe used to season her stories with the requisite amount of ghostly horrors capable of explanation in the last chapter so has miss edwards effected a compromise between her own sense of right and the depraved appetite of the public giving zest to her romance by the introduction of a bigamist who as the curtain falls is proved to be a man of exemplary character what her story loses by this compromise the personal character of the lady gains whether it will not be best for her both as a woman and an artist to have no further transactions with white pitch is a question which she will do well to put to herself,englishfiction_contra

retribution of the sins of though parents upon the children is worked out with the pitiless fatality of a greek tragedy a young englishman of high fa mil and expectations the son of a weak father and a hard worldlyminded mother who have both united to indulge flatter and spoil him goes to italy in a fit of wilfulness whilst he is thinking that he will study art and paint the great picture which is

finds that she belongs to a family consisting of the father an invalid the mother this daughter and a young girl her companion they live in a mysterious seclusion absolutely isolated from society in an old palazzo in bologna their only acquaintances are the marchesa who lives or starves iu a distant corner of her ancestral halls and her son guido lamberti the marchesa a bigot under the influence of her priest and the son a young italian of the present day one of the best types of his nation the period is 1848 when the hopes of italy were high for deliveranceare both admirable types of character guido lamberti loves the english girlgilda courtneysilently devotedly steadfastly she loves him like a young girl without knowing it or selfquestioning of any kind sara gisborne her companion a young girl adopted from charity by the courtneys loves him too she is the dark angel of the story one of those black flashing exceptional beings who have one virtue linked with a thousand crimes whose natural element is in melodramas and french novels and whoso bodily sresentment may be seen at the port stlartin laurence carr of carrlyon the hero having seen gilda and fallen in love resolves after the fashion of young men who have been spoilt and who have never had occasion to deny themselves the indulgence of a single whim or emotion in the course of their lives to see more of her and casts about for means of becoming acquainted with the courtneys to this end he displays some ingenuity and by means of an accident created for the purpose by him he gets admitted into their domestic interior the play of the different characters is extremely well delineated mr courtney the father a coldmannered reserved highlybred english gentleman evidently in a wrong positionhis wife delicate sad blameless  but struggling with the influence of some past event which overshadows her life are both very cleverly drawn and give the impression of having been taken from the life the inci dents aro few the interest of the story turns entirely upon the action of the characters upon each other and the influence of their qualities upon the lives and fortunes of each other which is all very skilfully and truly managed carr becomes confirmed in his intention of proposing for gilda in spite of his ignorance of all her connexions and antecedents partly by the discovery of their sudden intention to quit bologna and partly by an illtimed and extremely detestable letter from his mother gilda might not have been likely to acquiesce in his intentions had not sara gisborne to get rid of her rival used all the treacherous and unscrupulous arts which black angels and demon heroines have used from time immemorial she persuades her that guido not only does not love her but that he avoids her hwing suspected her love for him and poor gilda who is guileless as a child recoils in trouble and dismay she works on guidos firide and sense of honour and tells him all the ies she thinks convenient she works artfully upon carr himself she discovers that she herself is the natural daughter of mr courtney and she obtains possession of the family secret of gildas parents this secret is quite dark enough to deter any man who did not love with a devotion and strength of character very rare in the world from seeking their daughter for a wife mrs courtney was a woman of high rank and had been the heroine of a terrible tragedy and cause celcbre she had eloped from her husband her lover had shot him dead in a duel and this was the reason why they were obliged to live in such profound seclusion under a false name gilda of course knows nothing of all this her mother is more than repentant if sorrow could efface crime her father dying of ennui and regret he is anxious to have his daughter married and though he would have preferred poor guido as the one who would have been less likely to be outraged by the knowledge of facts still as guido has drawn back carr cannot be called ineligible and mr courtney resolves to accept him his wife wishes the whole truth revealed courtney like a man decides that it is unnecessary he merely impresses on young carr that the intimacy and proposal had been of his own seeking all the parties act up to their own respective characters and the tragedy of the story results from the natural influence of some quality not exactly reprehensive or some other quality which like the sulphur and saltpetre in gunpowder are harmless until brought together when the result is at the mercy of a casual spark carr marries gilda who is a charming and adorable creature she has told him the truth about guido so far as she knows it herself and then she sets herself to efface the dream of the past and she succeeds it has often been remarked that the daughters of those women who have lapsed from virtue are brought up more carefully and sternly than the daughters of mothers who only know evil by hearsay and mrs courtney has expiated too bitterly the sin of her youth to have left gilda unguarded guido goes away to fight the battles of nis country but not before sara gisborne has made an avowal of her love and been refused in the most chivalrous but decided manner possible being a determined young woman she is not to be repulsed but bides her time and makes use of the knowledge she has obtained to wring terms from mr courtney who dies under the sudden shock of her threats and taunts following up her advantage she wrings from the widow nearly every farthing she possesses and then disguising herself as a boy she enlists as a recruit in the army of charles albert in the same regiment with guido mrs courtney left almost destitute has to accept a home with her daughter and then occurs one of the vital incidents of the story aud one which though possible is too exceptional to make it probable gilda and mrs courtney wish to visit the hospital where the wounded have been taken after the battle of novara carr unwillingly consentshe leaves his wife and mother to go inside and awaits them guido has been wounded and he is the tenant of the first bed they pass beside him sits sara gisborne gilda hears his ravings and recognises that he has always loved her and that sara has lied it is too late now and the pure womanly way in which she clings to the husband she has taken shutting out all regret or thought of the past is very delicately drawn and is charming unfortunately carr hears accidentally that guido is in thc hospital appearances are against gilda but this time her perfect truth and frankness disarm his suspicious nature but the first grain of sand has been thrown in to trouble the waters carrs mother comes to visit them and the mischief and discomfort from the incompatible natures of all the parties are very true to life in the midst of this the malignant jealousy of sara gisborne comes in maddened that gilda has heard the truth of guidos love for her she writes to carrs mother the family secret connected with her sons wife this is well managed the reader is never bewildered into palliating the guilt of the unhappy mother but the sympathy and pity that are roused are none the less strong the interview between carr and mrs courtney is the most powerful scene in the book the secret is kept from gilda but the evil influence it exercises cannot be averted her husband loves her but he cannot forget the blood that she inherits and doubts whether the evil principle has not been entailed upon her along with it and he never really trusts her afterwards sara disappears and leads a life of more than questionable repute till she marries an old mau who is a duke leaving her a widow under some suspicion but she has become rich fashionable and a lionne in society watching over guido in the distance and still biding her time guido poor fellow gets into the way of starvation and in a not very probable or possible way becomes again mixed up with gilda and her husband and again rouses the latent jealousy of carr which has never been quite extinguished gilda has no suspicion of the web of false appearances and false inferences to which her innocent and natural conduct towards guido gives rise it is the curse of her parents sin that is working upon her the working up of the dinotimenl is very interesting but not very probable but the reader will not

barren honour a tale by the author of guy livingstone 2 vols parker son  bourn the title of this novel is the clue to the lesson which it is intended to inculcate it is generally considered a high crime and misdemeanour against the laws of novel reading to glance at the end of a book till we have fairly and honestly worked our way through the preceding volumes up to the last page without having a notion wnat we shall find there but nevertheless we believe that by bearing in mind the catastrophe upon which the plot is hinged we are not only able to take a more lively and absorbing interest in the story itself but we are also better qualified to appreciate justly and without bias the powers and abilities of the writer in carrying out the design he has in view we do not therefore apologise for quoting here the last words of the author of barren honour  i have attempted he says to sketch roughly what befell a man very weak and erringwho was often sorely triedwho acted ever up to the light that was given him at the cost of bitter selfdenial and selfsacrificewho nevertheless in this life failed to reap the tithe of his reward alan wy verne was strong up to a certain point but he had not faith enough to make him feel always sure that he had done right in defiance of appearances nor principle enough to keep him from repining at results he could neither comfort himself nor others thoroughly he was a chival rous truehearted man but a very imperfect christian he dared not openly rebel against the laws of god but he was too human to accept unhesitatingly the fulfilment of his decrees throughout alans life honour usurped the place where religion ought to have reigned paramount he shrunk from shame when he would perhaps have encountered sin to that one principlesound enough if it had not been the ruling onehe sacrificed love and friendship and revenge and life thus it will appear that the author proposed to himself no very light or pleasant task when he undertook to prove by relating this story what a barren fruitless dreary comfortless and unsatisfactory thing honour becomes when a man has no higher principle of action no more solid basis on which to rest his future hopes sir alan wyverne had but one great object in life the desire to do his duty thoroughly as a gentleman and a man of honourand he did it but his life was a failure the story is an old one but not the less interesting for that sir hubert vavasour is an honest goodnatured reckless country squire with a mortgaged estate an idle son a lovely daughter and last but not least a clever and intriguing wife alan wyverne the squires nephew is not unlike him in character and the two are sincerely attached still more attached however is sir alan to his beautiful cousin helen and though he knows he has already wasted the chief of his substance in riotous living and that lady mildred will certainly  forbid the banns he nevertheless has the temerity to avow his affection to his cousin as well as to her father and ventures to indulge in some hope that it may be possible to arrange satisfactory settlements enabling him eventually to carry off the fair helen as his lawful prize sir hubert is quite aware of all the difficulties in the path but he cannot resist the temptation to make his daughter and his nephew happy so he shakes his bead and consents but owns he has not the moral courage necessary to announce the awful fact to my lady my lady however baffles them all she caresses her daughter playfully reproaches the culprits plan and fairly puzzles her husband by her tacit acquiescence but in her heart she makes a vow that  it shall never be  she thought that such a weddingdress would become her daughter worse than a windingsheet and she will leave no stone unturned to break off the engagement she goes to work warily and with caution and makes alan feel properly grateful to her for her great kindness and consideration she however contrives to persuade him to wait a twelvemonth before fixing the weddingday and she insinuates that her daughter is exacting and absurdlyjealous for the rest she trusts to her usual good fortune and lies in wait for an opportunity to make the most of the little advantages she has already gained on her sons max vavasour return home the tug of war begins in earnest max openly avows his regret at the marriage having been even so far settled he owns he  has no prejudice against wyverne personally for nobody has such weaknesses nowadays but it is a simple question of political expediency max brings his friend lord clydesdale to the dene it is too late now of course to hope any good can come of that but max and his mother understand each other and they have a year before them yet raoul tenth earl of clydesdale was the premier parti of england and a coarse selfish overbearing illlooking young man but it would have been a very proper match for helen and so lady mildred feels naturally aggrieved at the thought of how much had been lost by alans rash and precipitate conduct lord clydesdale moreover no sooner set eyes on helen than he began to think himself an illused man he could have made up his mind to confer on her the title of countess of clydesdale and he did not see what right wyverne had to secure the young lady without even giving him a choice in the matter it was not to be born with patience his friend and toady harding knowles suggests that many things might happen before the fatal twelvemonth is over  sir alan might die you know or miss vavasour come to her senses harding does not object to laying very long odds say 6000 to 50000 that the marriage will never take place the bet ls accepted and booked with looks of wicked crafty significance by knowles who for some trifling reason hates alan and is sadly in want of money from this moment the plot thickens alan is persecuted by letters with a curious cypher engraved on the envelope lady mildred and her daughter receive anonymous letters warning them to inquire into his conduct during his absences from the dene explanations are given and received but somehow they are not quite satisfactory lady mildred pretends to make excuses for him thereby doing his cause a great deal more harm than good helen has seen mrs lenox once and has heard of her often she is hurt and grieved at what she believes to be alans conduct with regard to that dangerous lady but she trusts him still and would conting to trust him till death only lady mildred takes care to prevent that and alan gives up his case as hopeless and retires from the field this is the weak point of the story it is extremely improbable that a man conscious of his own innocence and aware that a trap is likely to be laid for his ruin would voluntarily sacrifice the woman he loves for the sake of the woman who loves him nina lenox is a careless imprudent creature always in trouble either about love or money wyverne does not pretend to care the least about her but he was goodnatured and helped her out of her scrapes and thought her rather a bore than otherwiseyet sooner than betray her confidence to his future wife even in his own justification he quietly breaks off his marriage with helen and makes both her and himself miserable for the rest of their lives this is the great instance of alans preferring honour to every other virtue or even duty helen not caring much what becomes of her after this marries lord clydesdale and hates him though he frees her father from his heavy embarrassments and saves the dene from passing into the hands of the jew who had intended to secure the property for his own thereby earning for himself the eternal gratitude of lady mildred and her son max we will leave the dinodment of the story to unfold itself to its readers at their leisure feeling convinced that with a little judicious skipping of lengthy digressions and superfluous descriptions of character in the first volume they will never rest till they reach the end of the book there is a most exciting description of a fight with some poachers and another of a hunting feat of sir alans which will delight the male readers of barren honour and there can be still less doubt that every lady will sympathise deeply with the sorrows of the countess of clydesdale and be ready to lament the mistaken views of the too scrupulous sir alan who in everything but this overstrained sense of honour is about as perfect and loveable a character as can be met with in any novel of the present day,englishfiction_contra

  esther waters esther waters is not the turning point in mr george moores literary career in several recent utterances it might have been read that the turning point was reached some time ago that he had worked out his old inspirations or was getting such new light on them as would transfuse them into something new only till now he has had no prominent opportunity of showing the changes in his aims or in his expression of these esther waters will then stand to mark the place where he turned off and sought other things than of old not that he has forsworn all his former methods or his former self but these are made to subserve the impulsive dominating force of the new spirit what mr moore set out to do in this story was to relate the life and adventures of a poor little kitchenmaid whom an unkind fate forced into the household of a racing betting squire and afterwards cast adrift on london in poverty and loneliness the circumstances of such a history are suggestive enough of ugliness meanness and vulgarity and mr moore it must be said has not heretofore been slow to make use of such opportunities well  esther waters  is not an idyll exactly but plunging boldly into the harsh unclean tawdry cruel life of london squalor of racecourse and publichouse glitter he has drawn up the essential reality and behold there is nothing in it alien to heroism of sturdy growth and purity that is inherent honesty courage and wholesome sweetness are hardy blossoms that stand and endure and bloom in poisonous air  esther waters the most vigorous denunciation of gambling that ever was written has been laid it is said under some kind of modified taboo it would be well to discuss this point of view if one could bring ones self to understand it it is easier to conceive of its striking readers as showing a moral purpose far too insistently from beginning to end it is pervaded by a sense of the everlasting usefulness and beauty of moral effort but though the purpose is always evident and near the surface mr moore has reached his particular result mostly by a refining and a ripening of his artistic perceptions the heaping up of detail and circumstance the pride in gathering all the material possible for scenebuilding the photographic method of  include everything as it comesit must be right if its there was an interesting stage in modern fiction accepted by some as a final artistic inspiration while as a matter of fact it was only science putting its spoke in begging art to take life seriously and look it in the face without fear half the behest was based on a complete misunderstanding of the temperament and the uses of art the other half was intelligent but the whole was obeyed for a time with conscientious literalness art is now recovering a sense of its own essential differences and conditions but it has retained a respect for common life and the understanding that such life can be used for artistic purposes mr moore has gone through the discipline he keeps the habit of minute observation some of the old pride in lack of fastidiousness and a belief in the uses of the camera but these he is not mastered by now  esther waters  is a democratic novel through it there breathe not only sympathy with life at its hardest but a hearty and altogether unpatronising respect for the strugglers mr moore exaggerates just as little as he idealises you see no giant tyrant consistently threatening and opposing and killing help friendliness kindliness are lights that stream into betting holes and burn down area steps and amid squalor and low aims for all his french sympathies mr moore has read the english heart aright he has seen the springs that keep it wholesome divined the consolations that keep it from being altogether debased the emotional protestantism of the little sects that gather into their narrow folds so much fervour and tender passion is shown as a living force and not only without cynicism but without patronage  i esther waters by george moare w scott and co there is little of beauty in circumstance or setting mr moore is wonderfully sparing of prettiness indeed his hand is a hard one in only a few passages does the beauty of the world shine through and this is one of them esther has been taken into kent to make friends with the relatives of her lover fred the religious stationer fred was on a ladder shaking the branches but he came down when he saw esther and harry his brother took his place esther and fred filled one basket then yielding to a mutual inclination they wandered about the orchard stopping on the little plank bridge they hardly spoke at all words seemed unnecessary each felt happiness to be in the others presence they heard the water trickling through the weeds and as the light waned the sound of the falling apples grew more distinct then a breeze shivered among the tops of the apple trees and the sered leaves were blown from the branches the voices of the gatherers were heard crying that their baskets were full they crossed the plank bridge joking the lovers who stood aside to let them pass a red moon rose behind the hillside into a dark leaden sky when they entered the house they saw the old farmer who had slipped in before them sitting by his wife holding her hand patting it in a curious oldtime way this is a glimpse as rare to the reader as it was to esther she did not marry fred after all a life with him was the brightest prospect she had ever had but duty with its roots in the past seemed to point away from the paths of comfort and even of strict morality  one doesnt do the good that one would like to in the world one has to do the good that comes to one to do this is esthers philosophy not a bad one faithfully adhered to to be in keeping with his subject mr moore has adopted a very plain diction he has held himself in there is nothing grandiloquent either in sentiment or expression there is no fine writirg at allto tell the truth there is a good deal of uncommonly poor writing but blunders and carelessness apart it is artistic in its methods and its tone it is painstaking plain and detailed like the life it paints there are shorter ways for poets and a poet mr moore is not but poetry after all while making us realise the misery and the heroism as a whole might have obscured what he particularly desired to showthe daily buffetings hourly chances mischances hopes and despairs of those that are not fortunes favourites gy,englishfiction_contra

cromwell doolan or life in the anny by the author of  echoes from the backwoods c two vols colburn this is a clever series of sketches chiefly humorous of a rambling reckless soldier life connected by a thread of story and coloured with some rich touches of irish character the hero is the supposed son of a low irish attorney who has got possession of a landed estate by the most atrocious rascality and has married the sister of a colonel he seems born to ill luck for his birthday the 20th of february when by a family custom he may choose his own dinner comes only once in four years so that only once in four years while his brothers and sisters have tiieir annual ducks and stuffed geese and sucking pigs can he have his beloved rolypoly or dog in a blanket and he has moreover one of his ears bit off by a pig at his foster mothers but he enters sandhurst with his uncles patronageas much as that may be worth  for col scabbart though a goodnatured is a disappointed man and writes perpetual pamphlets to reform the service and bring back the armys old liverwing days when it was forbidden to a subaltern to help himself to that delicacy till he ascertained it was not wanted by his field officer scabbart is a good sketch and so is that of the studies especially the algebraic equations of sandhurst college which are clearly from the life indeed this is the merit of the book that its most extravagandy humorous scenes are not unreal the exaggeration is in the life itself not in the picture of it and an amusing picture of subaltern life it is a sort of story is woven with it arising out of the rascality of doolan s father whose end we may remark is very tragical and irish which results in the rejection of that scandalous paternity and in the rehabilitation of the hero as no less than the genuine representative of the oneill but the whimsical parts of the book are better than the sentimental old scabbart s death on hearing of warners long range is the only sort of sentiment the writer can turn to much advantage his book will occupy an idle hour pleasandy enough,englishfiction_contra
the one i knew the best of all by mrs h li burnett warne  co every human being has it is said material for one good novel in his mind namely the history of his own life it is still more probable that every ono has material for a juvenile autobiography like this but how few there are who can turn such material to account mrs burnett supplies a delightful though perhaps a rather egotistic history of the first fifteen years of her life beginning at the age of two when she realised that  big people always get their own way she had a passion for quite new babies but her dolls were stuffed with sawdust and had no charm for her until she learned to read and discovered that one doll in its time could play many parts her dolls were worked hard their lives were short but their existence was full

books to amuse children this christmas the four we have chosen for notice here have this in common that they are well and plentifully illustrated one of them is not a fairy story  the one i knew best yet with many children it will be the favourite because it is not about an imaginary and ordinary child in the nursery but about a real and interesting one who did live and grew up without forgetting what she used to see to like and to think when she was a little girl no imaginary heroine could be more delightful or more original she had an extraordinary talent for having adventures with her dolls and then she used to write romances the story of her infantine literary career is full of thrilling secrets and surprises her readers will be glad she never got rid of her scribbling habits as for the fairy stories dr macdonald says his are for the childlike even if they be seventy five but seven and five need not be afraid they are dull for that reason they are singularly beautiful and poetical and children in their quieter moods will find them altogether sympathetic there is such fine good work in them that they should be counted with dr macdonalds best the stories in the  winged wolf

alec forbes of howglen when a vein of strong religious feeling runs through a novel it is apt to exercise a very deadening effect upon the spirit of the story the novelists religion is usually of a remarkably polemical nature and beneath the icy blast of controversy the flowers of poetry wither the hand of the artist grows cold and stiff we are all only too well acquainted with the ordinary evangelical romance in which an erudite lowchurchwoman possesses almost in her infancy an amount of protestant learning which would enable her to confute the whole college of cardinals and eventually wins the heart of the richest nobleman in the county with the highchurch novel we are even more familiar for miss young and her imitators have gained for it a certain popularity one which in many cases is not wholly undeserved although there is no little narrowness and intolerance displayed in most of the books of this class dissenters have not availed themselves to any very great extent of the assistance which fiction offers to a zealous proselytizer and we do not often meet with works resembling that american romance in which so great an effect is produced by the heroines determination never to marry any one but a hardshell baptist perhaps as years go by and the thoughts of men expand every sect will have its advocate in fictitious as well as in periodical literature a mormon romancer would have enviable opportunities at his disposal for settling his superfluous heroines and we believe that a genuine sensation might be created by an author who was bold enough to make his hero a conscientious muggletonian if such books appear in our time we shall read them with interest at present it is to a work of a different nature that we propose to call the attention of those of our readers who are not already acquainted with ita story which is not and does not pretend to be a religious novel but one which is full of the most true religious feeling and which without sermonizing teaches a moral lesson that too many sermons fail in inculcating the story of  alec forbes of howglen a reprint of which is now before us endeared itself no doubt to most of our readers when it first appeared two years ago we need not therefore enter upon an analysis of its plot nor is it necessary to follow continuously the fortunes of any but one of its leading characters our present intention is rather to dwell upon the religious teaching conveyed in the account of the mental trials and consolations of annie anderson the storys charming heroine and of the schooling through which she went in the secluded little township in which her lot was cast it is difficult to say which is the most attractive of the two great charms of the book the music of the poetry which renders so many of its chapters melodious or the nobility of the thought by which it is throughout informed of the first it would be easy to fill our columns with specimens so numerous are the prose poems scattered about the story describing the face of nature in its various moods or telling some tale of humble joy or alec forbes of howglen by george macdonald ma london hurst a blackett sorrow pbut we will pass on to the account of annie andersoiis relioious experiences written by nir mt1acdoinald in his graver mood full of deep and genuine feeling and sympathy from first to last wise and tender and true when we first meet with annie anderson she is a delicate child about nine years old with blue eyes half full of tears hair somiewhat between dark and fair gathered in a silk net and a pale face onl which a faint moonlike snwie was gathering she is alone in the world for her parents are dead and she is left to the charge of a hard nliiseily unsympathetic relatiol who rejoices in the kingly namnie of robert bruce the scene with which the description closes of the first day sbe spends in his house giver an1 excellent idea of his nature and of hers very simple and very touching is the account of her horror when after being sent to bed in the dark in order to save the value of a candleend her prayers were interrupted by a terrible noise of scrambling and scratching and scaniperirg in the very room beside hers she knew there were rat3 iear her creatures of which she was terribly afraid and her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth with terror ibut her heart did what her tongue could not docried out with a great and bitter cry to one who was more ready to hear than robert bruce and what her heart cried was this 0 god tak care o me frae the rottans there was no need to send an angel from heaven iu answer to this little ones prayer the cat would doannie herd a scratch and a mew at the door the rats made one frantic scranibt and were still  its pussy she cried recovering the voice for joy tlat had failed her for fear fortified by her arrival and still more by the feeling that she was a divine messenger sent to succour her because she had prayed she sprang out of bed darted scross the room ald opened the door to let her in a few moments and she was fast asleep guarded by gods angel the cat for whose entrance she took care ever after to leave the door sjar her next trial is in the dayschool to which she is sent over which presides a village tyrant anamed murdoch malison so terrible to his scholars does he make the hours they spend with hiu that every day to them was a cycle of strife suffering and deliverance birth and death with the lifestruggle between were shadowed out in itwith this difference that the god of a corrupt calviuiim in the person of murdoch mlalison ruled that world and not the god revealed in the man christ jesus most of the children who attend his school feel the day more or less a burden but they go home to heaven for the night annie has no home for the bruces house is none for her so that there is nothing for a time to restore her spirits in the intervals between her sufferings and she loses strength and vitality the little colour she used to have dies out of her cheeks her face grows thin her eyes though tears are seldom seen in them  look well acquainted with tears  and she never smiles for there is nothing to make her smile air macdonald writes about the tyrant with a righteous wrath but also not without a kindly appreciation of the fragment of good that lies buried beneath evil in the mans nature he brings down upon him deserved retribution but then he stays his hand and there are few more pathetic scenes in the story than that in which the schoolmaster after having broken down in his trial as a preacher goes home bitterly feeling the disgrace which attaches to him as a stickit minister and is followed all the way by the limping steps of a poor little fellow whom he had one day accidentally crippled in his anger and who has since become intensely attached to the master who has tried to make up for that wrong by unusual kindness one good result at all events springs out of annies attendance at the school it is there that she becomes acquainted with alec forbes a boy a few years older than herself to whom from that time forward she devotes herself with all the force of a sensitive and enthusiastic nature but it is not to the lovestory contained in mr macdonalds book that we now wish to call attention though a purer and more charming one it would be hard to find we pass on from alec himself to some of annie andersons religious teachers one of these is mr cowie the ministerone of an old schoola worthy kindhearted man  with nothing of what has been called religious experience but he knew what some of his lords words meant and amongst them certain words about little children he had a feeling likewise of more instinctive origin that to be kind to little children was an important branch of his office so he receives anne kindly when she ventures to visit him and to ask him to lend her a poetry book while speaking of her poetic studies we cannot refrain from mentioning the charming scene in which annie recites the first ballad she had learned to her young friends alec and curly macwha in the shop of george macwha the carpenter one may read it and two or three others like it over and over again with neverflagging pleasure the next time annie visits mr cowie she is in deep distress thomas crann the stonemason a calvinist of the deepest dyethe delineation of whose character is a masterpiece of descriptive arthad persuaded her to go one sunday evening to the  missionary kirk there she listened to a terrible sermon by a nreacher  in whom religion was clearly a reality though not so clerl a ld  g otsoclearly a gladness and to whom the moment she looked in his face she submitted absolutely the sermon was on the words the wicked shall be turned into hell and it produced upon annie the immediate conviction that she was one of the wicked and that she was in danger of hell fire when it was over she crept out into the dark street as if into the outer darkness  her first impulse was to run to alec and curly put her arms about their necks and entreat them to flee from the wrath to come but she could not find them tonight she must go home she would pray for herself and for them in her dark little garret where she had prayed before against the rats and had been heard  but alas for p nor annie and her chapelgoing as she was creeping slowly up from step to step in the dark the feeling came over her that it was no longer against rats nor yet against evil things dwelling in the holes and corners of a neglected human world that she had to pray a spiritual terror was seated on the throne of the universe and was called godand to whom should she pray against it amidst the darkness a deeper darkness fell despair comes upon her and in her deep distress she goes as soon as she can find time to consult with mr cowie on her trouble  ye see sir she says  i gaed last night to the missionar kirk to hear mr broon and he preached a gran sermon sir but i haena been able to bide mysel sir syne for i doobt in ane o the wicked at god hates and ill never win to haven at a for i canna help forgettin him whiles an the wicked 11 be turned into hell and a the nations that forget god that was his text sir and i canna bide it poor mr cowie is sincerely anxious to console his little friend but he is terribly hampered by the doctrines of his church he can only tell her not to trouble herself about predestination and election for to those stumblingblocks his conversation with her soon leads and he gives her a shilling by way of relief to his own heart and when she has left him he goes down on his knees and hidcs his face in his hands annie goes away comforted but not convinced and so after a time she tries another spiritual adviser and confides her troubles to thomas crann we would gladly if space would permit extract the record of her conversation with him and the extremely powerful and poetical description he gives her of the night he spent in the peat moss  cryin to the lord for grace and of the joy that filled his heart afterwards when it was revealed to him that he was  ane of the chosen but we cannot refrain from quoting a few lines from the description of another interview between him and annie at a later period when her religious doubts and fears have vanished and her religion has become to her an unalloyed delight thomas crann has had his usually irritable temper still further embittered by illness and the pain arising from a severe accident there were times when he would fall into fits of doubting as to whether he really were one of the elect and at such moments he was particularly savage if any one interrupted his devotions if his housekeeper should then happen to call to him through the door bolted against time and its concerns the saint who had been kneeling before god in utter abasement selfcontempt and wretchedness would suddenly wrench it open a wrathful indignant man boiling brimful of angry words and unkind objurgations through all which would be manifest notwithstanding a certain unhappy restraint having driven the enemy away in confusion he would bolt his door again and return to his prayers in twofold misery conscious of guilt increased by unrighteous anger and so of yet another wall of separation raised between him and his god on some such occasion as this he was disturbed one day by a visit of condolence from one of the deacons of his church thomas was upon his knees by the fireside with his plaid over his head startled by the weavers entrance he raised his head and his rugged leonine face red with wrath glared out of the thicket of his plaid upon the intruder in his anger he drives away his wellmeaning visitor and then returns to his interrupted devotions but he is conscious of having been ungenerous and unjust and he feels  worse than ever and more as if god had forgotten him than he had felt for many a day presently there comes another knock and little annie anderson enters the room so he tells her to come and kneel down beside him that they may pray together without a word of reply annie kneeled by the side of his chair thomas drew the plaid over her head took her hand which was swallowed up in his and after a solemn pause spoke thus oh lord who dwellest in the licht inaccessible whom mortal eye hath not seen nor can see but who dwellest with him that is humble and contrite of heart and liftest the licht o thy countenance upo them them that seek it oh lord here the solemnity of the appeal gave way before the outbursting agony of thomass heart oh lord dinne lats cry in vain this thy lammie and me thine old sinner but for the sake o him who did no sin forgive my sins and my vile temper and help me to love my neighbour as mysel let christ dwell in me and syne i shall be meek and lowly of heart like him put thy speerit in me and syne i shall do richtno frae mysel for i hae no good thing in me but frae thy speerit that dwelleth in 1181 1 after this prayer thomas rises refreshed and hopeful and sends annie on a message of reconciliation to his former visitor the weaver there are many other similar passages in which thomas crann figures over which we would gladly linger but we have only space for one more extract we will take it from the charming scene in which annie is sitting with her blind friend poor old tibbie dyster a great affection has sprung up between the old woman and the young girl and annie who has lately been studying milton has one evening been reading aloud to tibbie samsons lamentation over his blindness the description is very touching of the blind woman listening to the end without word of remark her face turned towards the reader and her sightless balls rolling under their closed lids and so is the dialogue which ensues from which we extract the speech with which tibbie closes a discussion as to whether she knew what the word light meantfor tibbie had been blind from earliest

jist tell him a that comes into my puir bln heidw we think that we have quoted enough to justify the very strong admiration for the book which we expressed at the beginning in these days of sensation novels it is as refreshing to meet with such a simple and yet powerful story as that of alec forbes as it is to step out from a heated ballroom into a moonlit garden redolent with the scent of flowers so great is the dramatic art displayed in the book that its characters seem to live and move before us and in the record of their words and deeds we scarcely know whether to admire most the pathos or the humour which chequer it with mingled light and shade and even higher than its artistic merits are we inclined to value those moral qualities which it possesses the breadth of its views the width of its sympathy with the struggles and sorrows of every human soul the freedom of its religious ideas from all that is narrow and cramped and hard it is one of the rare books which when we have read them we desire to keep by us knowing that there will be times when we shall be glad to turn to them as we would turn to a trusty friend  alece forbes of ilowglen by g macdonald ma hurst  blackettmr macdonalds description of a small scotch community in alec forbes of howglen hovers so uncertainly between a direct study of provincial manners and a religiopoetical treatment of northern peasant life that it is difficult to determine on what definite principles he has drawn it the ictures he gives of external nature are often ighly poetical and abound in incidental touches of great felicity but are deformed by the constant occurrence of strained images and rhetorical redundancies the story revolves round the fortunes of two children who grow up to maturity and ultimate marriage in the midst of the struggling life of a poor community the girl whose character is the more studied of the two should have given her name to the tale and falls but little short though very decisively so of being a charming portrait in fact there is just enough merit in most of the features both of conception and structure in  alec forbes of howglen to interest but yet to disappoint the calvinistic system which is criticised and yet accepted as the most rational view of life meets with the same half treatment that most other things do at mr macdonalds hands the narrowness of mind which it produces in most of the persons of the tale is protested against yet an effort is made to show how it can still be reconciled with the softer christian virtues it is impossible to extract poetry from the calvinistic turn of thought where its professors are not the objects of persecution the view of this world and the next which it holds up to its devotees is founded on an antagonism to external authority and can only maintain itself by constant conflict where it has become a dominant system the warfare has to be carried on with spiritual powers and the imagination must furnish forth the forms of danger which are no longer offered by the external world in spite of his opposition to the uncharitable tone which is inseparable from this theology mr macdonald yet determines that in some vague way or other all the personages of his tale in whom he wishes to interest his readers shall be born again and wee their fathers face after a mystical fashion that as might be expected is but little intelligible on the whole this novel is but a childs tale for grown up people it has little root in clearly seized experience and moves about in an atmosphere of diffused poetry and vague theology that is somewhat wearisome and yet one feels a kind of reluctance in speaking of it with disrespect a certain amiable tone which runs throughout the volumes is very attractive and makes us think well of their author but it is a decided fault when on laying down a tale we are more occupied with thoughts of the writer than of the persons he has brought before us the present is an undoubted advance on mr macdonalds former works and if in future he turns to a still closer study of life and character in the outside world mistrusting a certain tendency at present too pronounced towards constructing his characters from the depths of his own consciousness we may yet have a really good novel at his hands  alec forbes of howglen new novels by george mdonald i  ma 3 vols hurst  blackett it is something to rejoice the heart that even in these days a novel can be written full of strong human interest without any aid from melodramatic scenepainting social mysteries and the physical force of incidents alec forbes of howglen is merely the history of some of the inhabitants of an obscure village in the north of scotland a country lass left an orphan and a young boy the sou of a widow a little better placed in the world are the maiu figures in the story but innumerable threads of interest are interwoven with them the human hearts by which they all live are opened to the reader and this is the real source of interestan interest deeper and stronger than can be woven out of mere circumstances however complicated or perilous the dialect of broad scotch in which the story is chiefly written may be a hindrance to indolent readers but the racy idiomatic flavour of the style would we imagine be inducement sufficient to overcome this difficulty there is a picturesque force in the scotch phraseology which takes away all vulgarity from its most homely speech  it may be the sense of the stern calvinistic doctrines under the shadow of which most scotchmen dwell which gives dignity to their expressions the incidents of the story are as we have said extremely simple and almost entirely confined to a small village the mainspring of the interest lies in the development of the inner life and spiritual history of all the characters it is not a religious novel and i yet the growth of the religious element in each  personage is the pervading idea showing how  notwithstanding diversity of gifts and differences j of doctrinal faith the same spirit works through all and that the hidden wisdom of all forms of religious belief and worship is contained in the j one word lovelove working in the heart towards god and towards man the religious  faith growing wiser and stronger as the spirit of love abounds this is a noble doctrine and j it is worthily preached every individual in the  story takes a firm hold of the readers sympathy  their difficulties their weaknesses their faults are all true to human nature and indicate a keen insight into the human heart they are all developed to their full nature and the meaning of their mistakes and faults is worked ont with an understanding heart the most powerful descriptive scene in the book is the great flood and it is masterly alec venturing his life to save annie anderson and old blind tibbi when the dread of the doom of the unconverted sinner has been just awakened within him is real heroism thomas crann the stern puritan who unable to be of active use himself has incited the boy alec to go on the desperate venture suffers more than he crying out in agony  lord let not the curse of the widow and childless be upo me thomas crann thereafter he was silent he remained kneeling his arms stretched out as stiff as the poles of the scaffold and the joints of his clasped fingers buried in the roots of the grass when a friend goes to look for him with the good news that alec is safe thomas fell on his face and he thought he was dead but he was only giving lowlier thanks james took hold of him after a moments pause thomas rose from the earth put his great horny hand as a child might into that of the little weaver and allowed him to lead him whither he would he was utterly exhausted it was hours before he spoke alecs gallant action is narrated with great spirit the night of peril passed by the young girl and the old woman whom he went to rescue is very beautiful it reads like a passage out of  the pilgrims progress the heroism in these three instances is perfectly unconscious and exquisitely appropriate to the individuals the episode of the cruel schoolmaster aud little truffy is painful but the spirit of love works through that also and moulds it to a beautiful ending the sketches of university life in glasgow are very good the temptations and fall of alec into grievous sin and sorrow are firmly handled and the friendship of cosmo cupples the whimsical and learned librarian for alec is admirably introduced and worked out but the reader must read for himself no account of the story would give any idea of the profound interest that pervades the work from the first page to the last  alec forbes of howglen is the work of a poet and it deserves as it will obtain a careful study from those who wish for some more abiding influence than the amusement of an idle hour the ballads and poems which are introduced here and there are all touched with grace and beauty and are well timed in the story,englishfiction_contra

great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,englishfiction_contra

1 the magic of kindness  or the wondrous story9 of the good huan by the brothers mayhew illustrated by george cruikshank and kenny meadows durton and co this is a tale of wonders every word of which is literally true at once to seize the delighted attention of youth and to leave on its dispositions a healthy kiudly and strong impression is or ought to be the aim of all writers for children the story of the good huan has this great merit it is meaut to expand the imagination while it elevates and harmonises the temper the subject matter of the tale is how a great king had a son and prevailed upon a healthy peasant to nurse him neglecting her own child how the young prince grew strong and an admired hero and the young peasant dwindled into a despised cripple how the spirit of revenge converted though cripple into a terrible giant who drank of the cup of revenge till the dregs grew bitter in his mouth  how the spirit of kindness made the giant a dwarf and endowed him with a wondrous power of conciliating love aud obedience and how this dwarf engaged in a mission of charity and gentleness and became finally a martyr and more powerful to inculcate his principles through martyrdom the gallant but at first callous prince with his dumb gentle sister iluan whether as cripple or fierce giant or dwarf strong in love and intellect  with the frail sister whom he loves and all the varied characters the thread of whose destiny is interwoven with theirs are presented to us in the gorgeous colours and imposing forms of an eastern tale but a higher life is breathed into them by the spirit of the homely english moral that at the same time pervades the story the only thing we could havo wished omitted by the author i3 the prefatory enumeration cf authorities for the leading incidents and though corresponding references in the notes children will feel them in the way we have to add that the inculcation of the pacific doctrine is carried to the ultraextrerao but to this we can hardly object the natural pugnacious tendencies are so inveterate that the young human sapling may safely be allowed a very considerable bend the other way we have ourselves we must frankly confess little faith in though efficacy of passive submission to aggression when the fierce mastiff ran openmouthed at the poor haymaker the frightened rustic laid it dead at his feet with his pitchfork but the dog was a favourite with his owner as quarrelsome two legged curs are with nations and horrible were the invectives that assailed though wielder of the pitchfork stripped of those ornaments however the brief dialogue was instructive  why did you kill the dog   because it was going to bite and tear me  could you not have driven him off with the other end of though pitchfork   so i would master if he had run at me with his tail we cannot give a more favourable specimen of the story before us than by quoting the scene of huan s martyrdom he perishes for refusing to sanction an unjust war but his death is only the consummate accomplishment of all the divine objects of his life but the people still looked upon huan as one beloved by god and feared to draw the sword unless he blessed the banners they were to fight under so aleph sought out huan in his dungeon and spake kindly to him promising him his liberty if he would but consecrate the banners of the troops bufc the dwarf answered  ye have set the olivebranch upon them and made the symbol of peace the emblem of war verily to implore a blessing on the one is to invoke a curse upon the other presently newg was brought to the city that the enemy were within a few days march of asulon and the citizens grew alarmed aud again cried aloud for the blessing of the dwarf then aleph knowing the superstition of the multitude feared to lead the people on without kuans benizon so he gathered together his troops and summoning the dwarf from his dungeon bade him in the presence of the assembled army invoke a blessing on the bannersthreatening him with death if he withheld it but huan asked the royal youth by what form of words he should call upon the compassionate the merciful to pour down his grace upon the banners of death  or by what blasphemy he should invoke the spirit of kindness to bless and make holy the flag of slaughter  now when aleph heard the rebuke he shook with anger and the army grew furious crying  away with him to the lions den  away with bim  then the unresisting huan was seized and dragged to the valley beyond though city walls and while some set a rude barrier round about the meadow others hurried to bring the cage of the roaring monster and when they had dragged it thither they placed it io the centre of the field as the hungry beast paced restlessly up and down its den and i made the hills rattle with its roar authy led on by voe threw j herself at alephs feet and besought him by the love he said he bore i her that he would spare her brother er oe too pointing to alephs empty sleeve silently reminded him how huan and the blind girl had saved him from the jaws of death but the young warrior could not forget that his father for the love of him they pleaded for had disinherited him of the throne aud he hated the dwarf not only for having forestalled him of the crown but for the craven principles he taught even whilst an armed enemy was marching to lay waste their city yet in pity for the blind girl who still clung to his feet iwseeching his mercy he aaked the dwarf a third time whether he would bless the banners for the third time huan refused saying he was the minister of kindness and aleph crimson with passion at the mans stubbornness cried  cast him in  let us see how this kindness will avail him with raging lions   then huan was thrust within the arena and the savage monster let loose upon him while the crowd climbed the neighbouring hills and stood breathiest with suspense as they gazed down upon the plain the huge lion sprang from his den and bounded towards huan who stood rapt in prayer but no sooner was the eye of the creature fixed upon the dwarf than the blackmaned beast crouched at his feet and as it rolled on itt back turned up its white stomach to he fondled by bim then huan recognised in the grateful brute the creature whom he had freed of the thorn and as he placed his foot upon the hons side it rolled backwards and

ginxs baby his birth and other misfortunes our library table strahan  co the author of  ginxs baby has wished to give good advice for the moral maladies under which society labours and he has enveloped it in a kind of jocosity which as often happens in the case of medicines for children is little fess distasteful than that which it is intended to sweeten moreover the comic element is so awkwardly mingled with the serious that its purpose is betrayed at once and we are repelled instead of attracted the story if we may so call it which serves as sweetening to the preaching is as follows  ginxa less grotesque name would have served the authors purpose equally well it is not funnyis a navvy and the baby is his thirteenth child on the birth of the twelfth ginx had vowed to drown the next and proceeds in due course to carry out his vow he is met as he goes to vauxhall bridge by various people among them a philosopher which gives the opportunity for a lecture on malthusianisma subject quite proper in its due place but liable to become improper if treated jocosely the baby is ultimately rescued by a man who takes him to a convent of course the nuns and their confessor have names which are meant to be funny but only succeed in being foolish from the convent he is taken by the protestant association and we have a little chaff of exeter hall and ito proceedings but we will not pursue ginxs baby through his varying career suffice it to say that after being exposed several times in the streets taken to workhouses and rejected by them he at last is adopted by the reform club becomes a page bolts with the spoons and ends by the very fate from which he had been rescued in infancy for he drowns himself from vauxhall bridge we are left somewhat in doubt aa to the panacea which the author himself would recommend for our social ailments  it is either a scheme of emigration or an alteration in the law so as to enable parents to drown their superfluous children from the general tone of the book we should say he means to suggest the former course but on the other hand a remark at the end of the book together with the catastrophe itself incline us to decide for the other we see all rights are reserved including we presume that of dramatising the story now if we may be allowed to advise this is what the author should do let him recast it in a dramatic form leaving out most of the moral part and introducing an immoral part let us say a byplot of an intrigue between sir charles sterling and sister something in the convent get one or two set scenes of vauxhall bridge by moonlight and such like and send it to the theatre if it does not in that form draw crowded houses for six monthswell we shall have our opinion of the modern taste in dramatic matters enormously increased  inxs baby his birth and other misfortunes strahan and co i london 1870 what a london navvy earning eighteen shillings a week ought to find society prepared to do with his thirteenth baby is a question easier asked than answered the historian of the son of ginx is rather severe upon the philosopher the police force the charitable agencies the parish authorities and the club politicians who somehow fail to make life pleasant to his hero  yet they do more for him than for the twelve brothers and sisters who were never threatened with drowning and are guiltless so far as the author explains of any sins of commission which should leave the infant like douglas jerrolds st giles no choice but to grow up in criminal habits to begin at the beginning a wandering malthusian suggests that on the whole ginxs baby had better not have been born he is suppressed by public opinion with a confused sense that the domestic virtues of ginxpadre and mere are on the whole beneficial to the community a relieving officer quotes not wholly unreasonable acts of parliament which constrain the reluctant father to maintain not drown his superfluous offspring the nuns who take the infant in hand next decline on reflection to provide for his body unless they may work their will on his soul a tedious satire on the  protestant detectc al association  is meant to show that charitable organisations have gaps through which any number of units may slip unseen to distress then it is the turn of the poor law guardians who seize the first opportunity of returning ginxs baby on the hands of ginx who deposits it on the threshold of a club in pall mall and emigrates here the authors case begins to break down the club adopts ginxs baby it is fed and clothed and moralised about till it is fifteen and if it is also petted and snubbed by turns that fate is not peculiar to foundlings that it should elope with some spoons instead of donning the livery of one of its patrons and finally commit suicide because it hadnt been murdered in infancy is mere matter of temperament whilst social satire is supposed to deal with types the author of ginxs baly feels strongly on some very important questions and has a fund of righteous indignation at the disposal of those who answer them amiss but his criticism would be fairer if hie did not try to cut up every body in a breath and especially if he would pass by the too obvious occasions for smart writing afforded by newspaper grievances h lawrenny,englishfiction_contra

  notion the substance of his house by ruth h boucicault allen  unwin is probably the majority of readers as soon as they have finished this story will be inclined to brush it on one side as too sentimental a more mature verdict will recognise in it a welltold tale which effects at least one of its objects which is to enforce the fact that however deep love between individuals may be it must broaden into affection and service to others to keep its savour for the rest the tale is a mixture of spiritual orthodoxy which appears somewhat small in the light of the greater truths which are not so much surplanting it as giving religion a broader and firmer basis the strongest character in the book is lost before we are a third through but the high level of attainment generally does much to reduce our regret for his death the authors selection of quotations for headings and her introduction again of some of them in the text enforce comparison between the succinctness of expression in the classics and the length at which modern novelists writ e,englishfiction_contra
the adventures of a french1 boy thte advenitres of a little frenco boy by alfred de brehlat translated from the french bell ayd daldy thile idea of writing this book was suggested to the author by the

pleasure the boy was deriving from the older 10ook it is cleverly written well translated illustrated with fifty illustrations by e morin and admiriably printed and got up nevertheless we shall be

  overshadowed l the shorter poems of frederick tennyson macmillan and co it is probable that few people know the name of frederick tennyson save from the chance connexion of relationship to the great poet laureate for all that he was a poet of no mean ability who but for the eclipsing glory of his brother might conceivably have made a name conspicuous in the history of victorian literature he had unfortunately too retiring a disposition a nature too fond of abstract study and a soul that loved and sought for seclusion such ideals were hardly the right weapons for a fight necessary to make the dense understand the separate identities of his brother and himself and frederick tennyson never tried to do more than please his friends with the poems that were to him one of the easiest methods of expression with no wish for a public reputation the poet did not restrain himself sufficiently ever to get it in his constant use of capitals which to him doubtless conveyed an extra interpretation and significant reality in his vagueness and diffuseness of expression and the frequent antitheses he employed may be traced without especial difficulty the fondness for the abstract that can never make frederick tennyson really popular with any except those who look for poetry to convey to them something beyond a simple story with a moral or a motto and a sweet sense of emotional music frederick tennyson very often does tell a simple story and he very often uses exceedingly sweet lines but in general his style is very different examine a verse from a poem entitled the mountain so from the faroff mount of poesy the worlds great shows like the hushd champaign seem the actual insubstantiality real what is shaped in fancys eager eye fear love a hope a dream it is doubtful if any but real poets will appreciate this stanza with its harshness in places and abstractness of philosophical ideas but there are times when frederick can become as philosophical and as musical as browning take for example these two lines with all the great dreams that lie behind all the possibilities of eternity and all the conceptions that hover behind space climbing into the awful infinite those stairs whose steps are worlds very roughly indeed this is the main trend of ideas that run through this book for we must admit that frequently the theme is monotonous and the poet reiterates in a different manner what he has already expressed it must be understood however that though there are many faults of style and execution in the craft of the poetry yet in itself the poems are those which only one who had soared above the realms of minor poetry could have written,englishfiction_contra

literature letters from dorothy osborne to sir william temple 16521654 edited by edward abbott parry griffith farran  co readers o macaulays essay on temple will readily recall his ardently expressed admiration for the writer of these lettersadmiration called forth by the specimens of her correspondence given in mr courtenays book from these specimens mr parry constructed bi account of dorothys lovestory in the english illustrated magazine for april 1886 another of her admirers who bad had access to the original papers and had taken copies placed these at mr parrys disposal and with the consent of the owner of the letters they are now published in this handsome volume with ample notes and elucidations and photographic portraits of dorothy and her husband it was in 1648 that they first metshe being twentyone and he twentyand that she made an indelible impression on his heart hy her conduct in the adventure at the inn her brother had written on the windowpane something highly uncomplimentary to the dominant faction the whole party were arrested and carried before the governor when dorothy procured their release by taking upon herself this  delinquency it was the beginning of an arduous wooing of nearly seven years temples father sir john was a parliamentarian and master of the rolls in ireland sir peter osborne dorothys father had held guernsey for the king after the crash of the monarchy 8ir peter was allowed to return to chicksands and to enjoy some portion of his former estate his sons were eager to raise the fallen fortunes of their house and the hand of dorothy was sought by several wooers who would have been far more eligible than temple in the matter of money the opposition of her brothers to dorothys wishes amounted at times to persecution the eldest john was away in gloucestershire but henry osborne was at cbicksands watching every oppostunity to get his sister  well that is richly  married personally he was deeply attached to her  seriously she writes  i many times receive letters from him that were they seen without an address to me or his name nobody would believe they were from a brother and i cannot but tell bim sometimes that sure he mistakes and sends me letters that were meant to his mistress till he swears to me that he has none    he many times wishes me a husband that loved me as well as he does though he seems to doubt the possibility ont but never desires that i should love that husband with any passion and plainly tells me so he says it would not be so wll for bim nor perhaps for me if i should for he is of opinion that all passions have more of trouble than of satisfaction in them and therefore they are happiest that have least of them dorothy did full justice to her brothers affection though its chief evidence and employment was the endeavour to make her life wretched by pressing upon her notice a succession of suitors all equally unacceptable if not equally odious and urging her to make her choice dorothy says of herself that she is not melancholy though she is thought so by those who think nobody in good humour unless they laugh perpetually she is not the least morose thinking goodnature  so absolutely necessary that where it is wanting nothing can recompense the miss ont the most contemptible person in the world if he has that cannot be justly hated and the most considerable without it cannot deserve to be loved so her buoyant spirits and equable temper carry her triumphantly through her ordeal with one exception to be noticed presently she makes rare sport with her wooers in her epistles to temple in the very first here given she reckons up her  escapes imprimis there was a gentleman so weary of his liberty that he would part with it on any terms  and dorothy as her last refuge got her brother to go down with him and see his house which as she had doubtless heard was wofully out of repair this though it were not much i was willing to take hold of and made it considerable enough to break the engagement since then she learns he has killed his man in a duel and is fled upont she is glad to have escaped him and sorry for his misfortune but soon after is consoled by learning that her  fighting servant is married her mothers death gave dorothy a respite till a gentleman liked her well enough to be very angry that her father would not give 1000 more with her  and i liked him so ill that i vowed if i had had 1000 less i should have thought it too much for him then her cousin sir thomas osborne afterwards earl of danby and duke of leeds cast upon her eyes of favour and made her bis formal addresses which ended in some comical fashion reserved for temples ear sir thomas shortly afterwards married and when he met henry osborne in town we are told they have the most ado to pull off their hats to one another that can be and never speak next some modest melancholy reserved man  began treating with her brother on the inevitable subject and it is going on fair and softly while she writes the gentlemans head is so taken up with little philosophic studies that i admire how i found a room there    tis very possible the next new experiment will crowd me out again dorothy is not above teasing her  servant sometimes and it is fair to remember when reading the next extract that matters had not yet come to a definite engagement with temple it is her humour to represent herself as entirely fancy free  after this some friends that had observed a gravity in my face that might become an elderly mans wife as they term it and a motherinlaw stepmother proposed a widower to me that had four daughters all old enough to be my sisters but he had a great estate was as fine a gentleman as ever england bred and the very pattern of wisdom i that knew how much i wanted it thought this the safest place for me to engage in and was mightily pleased to think that i had met with one at last that had wit enough for himself and me too but shall i tell you what i thought when i knew him you will say nothing ont twas the vainest impertinent selfconceited learned coxcomb that ever yet i saw this solemn fogy was sir justinian isham of lamport northampton and on him the emperor as she dubs him dorothy bestows some of the archest hits of her mischievous pen he enlivens the correspondence wonderfully sometimes dorothy jestingly thinks she will have him and then marry temple to one of her daughters for their sakes she regrets her refusal   o my conscience we should have all joined against him as the common enemy for those poor young wenches are as weary of his govern1 uient as i could have been he keeps them so much prisoners to a vile house he has in northamptonshire that if but once i had let them loose they and his learning would have been sufficient to have made him mad without my help she never had but one letter from him bat thut was worta twenty of anybody elses to make sport witb he wrote a latin letter about her which she wishes she had to show temple  twould serve you to laugh at this seven years the worst of my faults was a height he would not cali it pride that was as he had heard the humour of my family  and the best of my commendations was that i was capable of being company and conversation for him she relates how he had bragged as if he might have married lady sunderland wallers sacharissa and algernon sidneys sister and that ldy sunderland was jealous of his attentions to herself  which certainly was a lie as well as the other when her brother tells her th it with all his wisdom sir justinian could be made an ass of and governed completely by any woman that had wit and discretion her comment is  i could not have flattered him into a belief that i admired him to gain more than he and all his generation are worth d irothy disposes of her  parcel of wooers  as gaily as portia they are heart whole with more courage than to die upon a denial  no thanks be to god none of my servants are given to that i hear of many every day that do marry but of none that do worse then she pretends to bewail herself  never anybody had such luck with servants what with marrying and what with dying they all leave me just now i have news brought me of the death of a rich old knight that has promised me this seven years to marry me whensoever bis wife died and now hes dead before her and has left her such a widow it makes me mad to think ont1200 a year jointure and 20000 in money aud all this i might have had if mr death had been pleased to have taken her instead of him well who can help these things   of dorothys life at chicksands she can give an exact account not only for the present but for seven years to come if i stay here so long after rising reasonably early she saunters about in house or garden till ten then dresses and goes into her fathers chamber  from whence to dinner where my cousin molle a fussy valetudinarian bachelor and i sit in great state in a room and at a table that would hold a great many more after dinner we sit and talk till mr b a suitor comes in question and then i am gone the heat of the day is spent in reading or working and about six or seven oclock i walk out into a common that lies hard by the house where a great many young wenches keep sheep and cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads i go to them and compare their voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses that i have read of and find a vast difference there but trust me i think these as innocent as those could be i talk to them and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the world but the knowledge that they are so most commonly when we are in the midst of our discourse one looks about her and spies her cows going into the corn and then away they all run as if they had wings at their heels i that am not so nimble stay behind and when i see them driving home their cattle i think tis time for me to return too when i have sapped i go into the garden and so to the side of a small river that runs by it when i sit down and wish you were with me you had best say this is not kind neither in earnest tis a pleasant place and would be much more so to me if i had your company i sit there sometimes till i am lost with thinking  and were it not for some cruel thoughts of the crossness of our fortunes that will not let me sleep there i should forget that there were such a thing to be done as going to bed as to her reading it is mainly in the french romances then in vogue for the translations of them she has no patience they are still so french in words and phrases that no one ignorant of that language could make anything of them she is for a plain style prefers writing to puttiog pen to paper and dislikes her brotherinlaw peytons letters excellent for what i know and the more likely because i do not understand them as much as the affectation of an acquaintance who would never say  the weather grew cold but that winter began to salute us she sees the poems of lsdy newcastle and is  satisfied that there are many soberer people in bedlam in one particular macaulay is hard on dorothy he speaks of her style as sometimes nambypamby passing over the anachronism we note the injustice she writes always with selfrespect though very frankly and if often tender is never weak and if her good taste is ever at fault it is in imitating the turns of her favourite romances but this happens very seldom the endings of her letters warm significantly and gradually from your humble servant to your faithful and your affectionate friend and servant to  yours or your sometimes with no signature at all till at lastafter fifteen years of wedded lifeshe is her  best dears most affectionate d t if she were really the correspondent of queen mary it was an unequal match between the two good womenone of whom wrote in her bible that it was given  the king and i on our orownation day dorothy has a friend whom she greatly admires and whose acquaintance she is eager that temple should makelady diana rich daughter of the earl vf holland who makes so many sore eyes with looking on her though  her beauty is the least of her excellencies the poor lady came to have sore eyes literally herself and thereby it seems lost a lover it mattered little aubrey tells the story of her strange meeting with herself as in a lookingglass in the grounds of holland house and ot her death soon after into the promised land of marriage dorothy is continually gazing as from some pisgahsome  specular mountand taking note of the ways of married folk  for example of life and instruction of manners she doubts that marriage alters some people strangely from the instance of one she had known so handsome so capable of being made a pretty gentleman transformed into the direct shape of a great boy newly come from school to see him wholly taken up with ruuning errands for his wife and teaching her little dog tricks and this was the best of him for when he was at leisure to talk he would suffer no one else to do it not that she is inclined to blame the men wholly she rather leans to the opinion  that there is no such cross as a wife and that  much of the blame lies in us for let the husband be what he will  his anger alone when it meets with nothing to resist it cannot be loud enough to disturb the neighbours and such a wife may be said to do as a kinswoman of ours that had a husband that was not always himself and when he was otherwise his humour was to rise in the night and with two bedstaves labour on the table an hour together she took care every night to lay a great cushion upon the table for him to strike on that nobody might hear him and so discover his madness but tis a sad thing when all ones happiness is only that the world does not know you are miserable she thinks it might be well that all such as intend to marry should live together in the same house for some years of probation and if they never disagreed should then be permitted to marry but she is struck by the reflection how few would do it then  if people proceeded with this caution the world would end sooner than is expected the calmness with which these matters are discussed almost disconcerts us till we remember that the writer is a young woman of sense intent on making a really prudent choice and  wanting courage to marry where she does not like being a firm disbeliever in the theory that love will follow marriage and she does not trust passion blindly either  where there is no reason to uphold a passion it will sink of itself but where there is it may last eternally with public matter unless they bear on the fortunes of those she loves dorothy meddles not at all when the long parliament is dissolved she is only anxious to know whether temple is at all concerned in it  for if you are not i am not only if i had been so wise as to have taken hold of the oller of henry cromwell i might have been in a fair way of preferment for sure they will be greater now than ever she enquires whether algernon sidney was really turned out and wonders whether mr pym might not have thought this as great a breach of privilege as demanding the five members  but i shall be talking treason by and by if i do not look to myself when temple is in london she gives him  little idle commissions a quart of orangeflower water from the great shop the flower pot over the exchange or the setting of her seals by a frenchman near salisbury house of her own diversions in town besides her being every night in the park and at new spring gardens we read little she heard stephen marshal preach and was disappointed  i listened to him as if he had been st paul and what do you think he told us  why that it there were no kings no queens no lords no ladies no gentlemen nor gentlewomen in the i world twould be no loss to god almighty at all this we had over some forty times which made me remember it whether i would or not at a later time she helped a cousin of hers successfully in fooling the impostor lilly  making him contradict himself the strongest that ever you saw but town life was not attractive to dorothy who had other reasons than her fathers illhealth for liking to be at chicksands her brother is for a while prevailed upon not to bring any of the suitors thither from the tittletattle that it breeds among neighbours that have nothing to do but to inquire who marries and who makes love but the current of life is not wholly unruffled there are agues and spleens and too often teasing coxcombsmr bennett mr talbot mr fish and mr freeman and greater troubles are ahead sir peter is manifestly going dorothys marriage therefore becomes a more urgent matter with her brother who wants to have a footing in his sisters future home the engagement with temple is suspected dorothy takes a pleasure in the recreation of confounding her brother and destroying all that his busy head has been working on since the last conference all her refusals are brought upon the stage like richard iiis ghosts from being the kindest brother and sister they grow deadly polite the most complimental couple in england at last came the dispute referred to by macaulay wherein says dorothy  we talked ourselves weary  he renounced me and i defied him it was a pity that macaulay did not recall the reconciliation of next evening wherein the disputants entering on the subject of religion talked so long ol it and so devoutly that it laid all our anger we grew to a calm and peace with all the world two hermits conversing in a cell they equally inhabit neer expressed more humble charitable kindness one towards another than we he asked my pardon and i his and he has promised me never to speak of it to me while he lives but to leave the event to god almighty this was no lasting relief at christmastide 1653 matters grew so melancholy at chicksandsher father dying her favourite niece and companion gone her lover irritated and jealousthat dorothy for once lost heart and longed for a quiet and early grave she begged temple to give up an engagement that promised no happiness to cither and her earnestness prevailed with him not indeed to grant her request but to be more reasonable in future and to help her in her troubles ia stead of adding to them it was time sir peter died in the spring of 1654 his harsh heir came to chicksands and dorothy went to london where her aunt and her brotherinlaw took charge of her by turns temple her  dearest now was in dublin with his father awaiting some appointment which might enable him to marry for dorothy was no sentimentalist though entirely disinterested  had you 20000 a year she tells temple  i could love you no more than i do    but certainly i know what an estate is but yet i would not be thought so inconsiderate a person as not to remember that it is expected from all people that have sense that they should act with reason  if any accident out of my power should bring me to necessity though never so great i should not doubt with gods assistance but to bear it as well as anybody    but if by my own folly i had put it upon myself the case would be extremely altered the good sir thomas peyton exerted himself here as he did in any case wherein his help was needed at knowlton it seems matters were finally arranged between the temples and the osbornes as in greater diplomacies there were punctilios difficulties sir john temple objected to osbornes bearing a part in the negotiation on account of the unhandsome reflections cast upon his son this was of course absurd as peyton could settle nothing without osbornes consent dorothy upon this for the only time in the correspondence loses her temper but checks herself in time  tis best for me to end here lest my anger should make me lose that respect i would always have for your father when all is eettled worry and suspense have done their work on dorothy and she has an attack of smallpox but though her beauty is gone at least for the time her goodness guards ber interest in temples heart their married life had more than an ordinary portion of sorrow of their nine children but two survived their infancy the daughter diam died in 1684 of her the only memorials are a charming childs letter to her father and her name upon a tablet the son john temple a week after accepting office under william

i the gay rebellion by robert chambers illus trated d appleton and co 6s the dainty preface to mr chambers latest contribution to the fiction market gave promise of very good fare to follow but after reading the last chapter there is a certain feeling that that promise has not been entirely fulfilled the stories are fantastic and treat of the wearisome  votes for women  campaign combined with the methods of eugenists in some instances companies of fair suffragettes go about with large nets with the object of entrapping after the manner of butterfly catching any man who physically reaches the standard the board of regents have decreed must be attained by those they wed the loss of four of new yorks brightest and best causes two of the hunted sex to go in search of their comrades with dire results love with which the eugenist ladies ought to have nothing to do persists in playing his part so that it is not difficult to imagine where victory finally rests the accounts are lightly handled and there is an occasional flash of humour but the spark is very small if it had been brighter or there had been a greater number the book would have been much more amusing,englishfiction_contra
  cripps the carrier cripps the carrier by r d blackmore london sampson low and co  cripps the carrier is not so good a novel as  lorna doone but then  lorna doone  may fairly be said to rank amongst the very best of the novels of our day that fall short of being really great novels indeed since the last of the immortal waverley novels came from the busy brain and active hand which having fought so long were to be so soon silenced the class of writings which though not absolutely historical romances were yet laid in a time and among people different from our own have not been over numerous  lorna doone  may claim a good position among them not indeed with esmond or with barry lyndon the cause of so many tours de force most notably george augustus salas clever  captain dangerous nor with the virginians even but belonging to the school of these and not unworthy with  the cloister and the hearth perhaps fitter comparison may be made for if the story of erasmus father and margaret of the redgold hair be greater the feeling that invests john ridd and his surroundings is more closely akin to the time in which the tale is placed than is mr reades work to days mediaeval it must be at once admitted that as never before mr blackmore wrote so good a novel as his romance of exmoor so never since has he approached very near to it but cripps the carrier is a much closer approach than its predecessor  alice lorraine is indeed very greatly its superior if it possesses many of mr blackmores distinctive defects it also boasts of most of his distinctive merits mr blackmores chief faults are a certain vagueness in his grasp of a story as an artistic whole a confusion and apparent incertitude dependent upon this as well as a tendency to diffuseness  and worst of all perhaps a habit of bringing many of his characters before his readers as if he assumed them to be already well acquainted and therefore deemed it unnecessary to further enlighten them for this reason and because the chief charm of mr blackmore lies in his great descriptive powers and his sharp and sudden analysis of nature more than in his power of telling a story he is seen at his best when he informs some single subject when as in  lorna doone  and  the maid of sker he tells his tale in the first person either as the person most interested therein or as some keen observer the reason for this is obvious enough that he is compelled to hold himself together as it were cannot allow himself to be so carried off into perpetual fresh woods and pastures new as is his wont in other cases moreover no matter how many characters he may bring upon his stage he is compelled to govern their actions by the observation of a single person whereas when dealing with them by himself he seems to get so interested in eaoh one as it arises as to for the time being lose all consciousness of the others the story and indeed all things beside in his anxiety to follow out the feelings of the puppet whose strings he happens at this moment to be pulling suddenly he remembers that he is not writing an exhaustive analysis of a human character and he hurries back with a start  to some other of his creations and in the frequent repetition of this process so much time is lost that the chronicle is at last if not exaotly brought to a lame and impotent conclusion at least considerably hurried and confused in its ending it would be indeed difficult to dramatise one of mr blackmores stories because there is in them so little of dramatic completeness as stories they are incomplete and incoherent as studies of character they are too often marked with sameness but in spite of these defects and the perhaps still greater one that his women are little more than names the fact still remains that it is his power as painter poet and philosopherfor he seems to exercise each of these capacities in his writingsthat make his works so praisedeserving between  lorna doone his greatest work and therefore containing the greater portion of his merits and  alice lorraine in which his defects were most marked  cripps the carrier may take a middle place but if not fairly made midmost then nearer to the latter than to the former novel the story is complicated and apparently impossible in its leading idea which is however simple enough the scene is laid in oxfordshire close to the university town the heroine grace oglander is carried off from her family by the family lawyer and villain of the story luke sharpe and hidden in a remote cottage she believing herself to be acting in obedience to her fathers wishesa belief induced by means of forged letters in her fathers name which tell her that he has been compelled to go to demeraraand to be thirty miles from oxford and her home instead of close at hand the object of this forced abduction has been on the part of the lawyer that she may marry his son christopher who will thus come in for her fortune but who is a manly young fellow wholly guiltless of art or part in his fathers plan luke sharp causes squire oglander to believe that his daughter has been murdered a belief that nearly kills the old man  but in the end the plot is discovered on account of christopher sharpes refusal to be a scoundrel and carry out his fathers plans grace is rescued by cripps the carrier lawyer sharp blows his own brains out and grace marries her lover russel overshute who does not however play any very prominent part in the story because like ivanhoe he is ill throughout the greater part of the tale the probability or improbability of the story need not bo discussed it is the right of the artist if he chooses and if his strength justify it to do as he likes in this matter that chloroform was not invented at the time does not destroy the interest in the chief event in the  tale of two cities that joan of arc did not die on the field of battle that mary stuart and elizabeth tudor never met do not alter the merits of schillers two great dramas  all that is demanded is that it shall appear to be possible and this the plot of  cripps the carrier seems scarcely to be it is overcrowded with figures a fact all the more regrettable because some are so excellent that it would have been better if the artistic force spent on the many others had been appropriated to their fuller development cripps the carrier himself the hero is a study worthy to stand by the side of  girt jan ridd  zacchary had a bright open face with a short nose of brave and comely cock a mouth large and pleasant and mild as a cows a strong square forehead and blue eyes of great vivacity and some humour he had true cripps hair like a hornbeam hedge in the month of january and a thick curly beard of good hay colour shaven into three scollops like a cloverheap his manner of standing and speaking and looking was sturdy and plain and resolute and he stuck ont his elbows and set his knuckles on his hips whenever both hands were empty the contrast between him and his clumsy knavish brother leviticus cripps is exceedingly well done and the only other member of the cripps family with whom we are brought into direct contact esther though wanting like most of mr blackmores female characters definitionconveys the impression of a sweet as well as pretty girl who finally marries the best man in the book after her brother hardenow  this was a man of great power of mind and led up to a lofty standard pure unselfish good and grandso far as any grandeur can be in the human compoundwatchful over himself at almost every corner of his ways kind of heart and fond of children loving all simplicity quick to catch and glance the meaning of minds very different from his own subtle  also and deep to reason but never much inclined to argue he had a shy and very peculiar manner of turning his eyes away from even an undergraduate when his words did not command assent as sometimes happened with freshmen full of conceit from some great public school the manner of his mind was never to assert itself or enter into controversy he felt that no arguments would stir himself when he had solidly cast his thoughts and he had of all courtesies the rarestat any rate with englishmenthe courtesy of hoping that another could reason as well as himself in this honest and strenuous nature there was one deficiency the rev thomas hardenow copious of mind and active clear of memory and keen at every knot of scholarship patient and candid too and not at all intolerant yet could never reach the highest rank through want of native humour his view of things was nearly always anxious and earnesthis standingpoint so fixed and stable that every subject might be said to revolve on its own axis during its own revolution round him and the side that never presented itself as the ludicrous or lightsome one of this man as of the other the carrier gladly would more have been welcome had its author but seen fit that more should be given and none of the others quite console for lack of these but many command high praise if lawyer sharp be a somewhat impossible though skilfullydrawn villain his wife and son are each in their own way admirable of the many others that jostle each other in these pages some are but mere sketches but strong sketches drawn with the firm hand of an able artist notably miss patch grim old maid and disagreeably religious  the deeds of the lord

would lay a soul or that shred of the spirit of human nature which stood instead of a soul bare before his audience of the heroine there is little to be said taken altogether  cripps the carrier is a fine book containing some characters noble in conception and in execution much too to which though incomplete praise must perforce be awarded for the strength shown and through all the book present everywhere is that great power of describing nature so simply and yet so clearly which recalls the fact that mr blackmore has translated the georgies of virgil,englishfiction_contra

of her travel will be consigned and when she opens her career  here and there there is more of this peculiar frolicsomeness upon sheets and husseylike oaths about husbands and a hoydenish sort of assurance that she will do as she pleases say what she will and come in what dress she likes slippers or gaiters in loose dress or full in dimity or in diamonds but never tightlaced nor straightlacedall which introductory rattle is as she defines it a  taking ones things off before she sweeps into the presence and astonishes the public by her exceeding liveliness when we add that belle gives us an index without any paging being noted our readers perhaps will infer that belles husband may have a shirt but that he is not particularly likely to find buttons upon it from the letters of this lady who taps st paul on the cheek assuring him that he is her model hero of a christian man we take belles views of her sisterwomen at washington  a word touching the great and allengrossing topic of dress may not be uninteresting to your fair readers as i have before written the newyork ladies as a general rule are the best dressed ladies in washington in this respect we are hard to beat not that we wear richer fabrics or costlier jewels tout au contrairc some of your southern belles beat us in their nightly display of laces and diamonds and in  low necks and short sleeves but the more tonnish of our newyork ladies whatever fondness they may have for precious stones and spider web trimmings think it vulgar always to wear them and as to low necks we ieave them to  low people in the presence of oertain distinguished ladies here i have felt grateful for the use of a pink fan to conceal my blushes hide oh hide those lulls of snow kc now do not think me squeamish or prudish i am not a bit of it but there is a time and a place for all things  and a miscellaneous gathering of promiscuous people is not the proper time and place for a stunning exhibition of a beautiful bosom one of the brightest looking and most sweetly dressed young ladies i have met here is the graceful brighteyed dignified daughter of the late judge woodbury of newhampshire i have only seen her in immaculate white and with only her swanlike throat bare but her courtesy in the lancers would take me off my feet if i were but i am not here are other ladies at st louis  the society of st louis judging from what i  saw at a wedding jam is decidedly metropolitan j almost cosmopolitan many of the young ladies  have been educated in new york and at the  bridal gathering at which i had the pleasure of j  assisting i met three or four opening flowers who  had just graduated from mme oakhillsand mme candas with all the airs and graces of those model institutions one of these was pointed  out as the greatest heiress of missouri worth more than her weight in gold and pretty and accomplished besides her temporal as well as her eternal charms by the natural law of gravitation surrounded her with admirers the mode of entertainment struck me as somewhat novel as well as liberal and expansive the bride is the only daughter of a distinguished lawyer and although his house is a very goodsized one yet wishing to accommodate the multitude of his friends he borrowed the me of the adjoining house and gave his guests the freedom of both still as i have said the party was a jama caution to crinolineand the dancing was kept up vigorously until five oclock in the morning the bride was not beautiful but brighteyed and intelligent and she went through her rile with as much selfpossession as though she had been married a dozen times many of the ladies were pretty two or three were handsome nearly all old and young mothers and maidens marred the effect of their symmetries and hid the beauty of their hair by most elaborate and unartistic devices called headdresses take a look at grecian statuary ladies and unartificialize yourselves in this particular there is no ornament for the head of woman like the natural glory of a clean soft simply arranged head of hair if i were a man i should always feel as if i would like to put my hand on such a head smooth it pet

grease and curlingtongsugh the mississippi has rather impudent treatment at belles hands  i shall not attempt to describe the majestic monotony of this mighty riverthe sewer of a hundred cities  the grand alimentary canal of a continent the vast valley through which it flows seems to me like a new creation and its porous cottonwood forests that fine its banks for a thousand miles look like the arboreal experiments of nature preparatory to more useful and ornamental production the cities we have passed cairo memphis vicksburg and natchezdisappoint me in size and appearance and the scattered and raggedlooking cotton plantations wear a dreary lonely aspect our captain a finelooking man six feet four who is both mant and galhtnt has done all he could to make the trip a pleasant one and his namesake and clerk has been most gentlemanly and attentive the fare has been good and hannah the chambermaid with her low soft sympathetic voice most assiduous in her attentions the principal entertainments have been afforded us by the variety of cargo taken in at the numerous landings and among other goods a drove of hogs which it took an army of darkies a couple of hours to persuade on board afforded infinite fun it was pig vs nig and such a grotesque struggle i have never seen the gentlemen in the forward cabin have also had their own fun by playing off a practical joke upon jo the barkeeper jo is a goodlooking wag who is rather fond of playing goodnatured  tricks upon travelers and the clerk of the boat has been watching an opportunity to pay him in his own coin and this is the way the thing was done among the livestock on board there is a flock of nine hundred sheep penned up as closely as they can stand the clerk complaining that he was liable to be cheated in the fare by a miscount proposed that the sheep should all be marked and numbered the job was a difficult and a disagreeable one but the ever ready and obliging jo volunteered for the task and with brush and markingpot in hand descended into the woolly mass and proceeded to business wben he had got fairly at work the captain tipped the wink to the passengers and all went down to witness the performance there stood jo in the centre of the flock with his coattails tucked up under hib arms his face at a red heat and looking bewildered at the task before him with a faint glimmering perception of the joke that it would be just as difficult to count the sheep after they were marked as before the party of spectators broke into a roar of laughter and jo looking a little  sheepish but taking the joke very good naturedly hurried out of the pen with all possible haste we have taken on board two small droves of negroes one of ten boys and girls mostly the latter bought in richmond for a plantation near vicksburg they cost the owner all expenses included about ten hundred and fifty dollars a head i asked the bestlooking girl of the lot her name she said it was cinderella slaves like the early christians have but one name and that her master had bought them for his own use i asked what that meant and she said to work on his plantation and not to bell again they all seemed perfectly satisfied with their emigration to louisiana another lot of twenty were taken on board lower down the river and were on their way to the neworleans market to be sold all except one a mulatto girl who seemed to be the travelling companion of the owner and would return with him one fellow became obstreperous and had to be put in irons among the objects of interest on the river none excites more attention than the lowly mansion of general taylor at baton rouge it is a mere cottage and a very humble one at that but as the home of a president of the united states it gives a historical character to the place and the traveller watches for it with eager curiosity from baton rouge to new orleans a distance of over a hundred and twenty miles the sugar plantations line both sides of the river and the green fields green trees with here and there clumps of orange groves rich in fruits and blossoms make one feel that the people of louisiana like the cuckoo need have no sorrow in their song no

consented to my waltzing with cousin charles you know the most fastidious of fathers always consent to the cousinly intimacies involved in these fashionable dances do you know it is the custom here for a lady to take a dancing gentleman with her to the hop on whom she leans and relies as her partner for the evening  there is very little promiscuous dancing here and the only way to  keep the floor is to have a partner constantly on hand everybody voted the fillmore hop a perfect success it was the best attended and the ladies looked their prettiest the room the dining saloon was brilliantly lighted  and there was a rich display of fringes and flounces of necks and necklaces a very superb looking lady from new orleans wore a bouquet of diamonds pearls and precious stones which  they say cost 20000 dollars it made all lesser trinkets  pale their ineffectual fires it is no use trying to eclipse everything be as brilliant and extravagant as you will some provoking madame

disciples of old isaac by giving a brief account of the sport we had in fishing yesterday and let me say in advance that every word of my fish story is true accepting an invitation from mr henry ludlam a fine specimen of a true virginia gentleman whom i met at the hop we started yesterday about 12 oclock for the  fishing grounds the party consisted of four gentlemen and no more ladies than that number of gentlemen usually desire to have with them on such an excursion i am not going to tell where we wentonly that we fished sitting or standing on terra jirma and caught as many twelve pounders as we cared to take home in two waggons and blue fish at that the strongest and gamiest fish that swims i now perfectly understand the force of the common expression as  wide awake as a blue fish my arms are positively lame from pulling them in mr ludlam who is the most expert and artistic fisherman in newport taught me how to put on the bait and then all that was wanting was skill to throw the line and strength to pull in the beautiful tinnies looking so sweet in their white vests and blue coats with distended gills that looked like red ruffles oh it was  fun alive in the evening after returning mr ludlam gave us a splendid fish supper when i learned a new sensationthe exquisite pleasure of eating the game of ones own catching today the breakfast and dinner tables of the  ocean house have abounded in unwonted piscatory luxuriesthe fruit of our  q yesterdays doings i no longer marvel at the j  angling mania having been fairly bitten with it in e the glorious success of yesterday i dont know w but i should like to enlist for a three months fishing i  voyage for mackerel cod or even for whale as i j am inclined to think the larger the game the greater i t the sport ps ladies who go fishing should i  leave their hoops at home as sitting in them on  i the rocks is as hard as sitting on a gridiron u c a bachelors ball and what belle thought i c of it j bravo bellevue eichelors you did the j f handsome thing last night that brilliant ball j  was a regular eclipser such dressing and un i  dressing of beautiful women was never before seen j in newport the fine saloon was crowded and  the tasteful pink decorations with pyramids of  i gasfixtures in the corners lighted up the scene as  the italians say a giorno sister and i had between j us a couple of beaux fresh from new york who  kept us from feeling alone in the crowd and helped   us bountifully to the  chicken fixins and other things the affair was unanimously voted a great i success and only cost the bachelors who gave it a v apiece some of the costumes were magnificent  beyond my power of description one dress in particular worn by a finelooking mother of ten children was perfectly stunningthe admiration of all the gentlemen if not the envy of all the ladies it was the richest pattern of moire antique in red and white that i have ever seen the splendour of the bodice was subdued by a lace bertha of misty fineness and the whole effect including about a pint of diamonds poured over all was dazzlingly brilliant or as mrs partington would say the tout en scramble was perfectly munificent but the oddest whim exhibited in the way of ornament was a headdress composed of gold pieces about the size of a halfeagle i did not count them up but i should think there was at least a hundred dollars worth attached to the young ladys hair by fine gold chains and dangling around her neck and ears it was decidedly a ditmffit4 conceit and reminded me of a man i once saw in new orleans who was adorned all over with gold coins of all sizes but the pretty young lady who wore them looked like an indian princess in her barbaric ornaments and surely the fashion has economy to recommend it unlike most other feminine trinkets it will always be worth what it cost another finelooking new york lady wore is her hair imitation ears of im4ivn corn as large and as natural as life my  private beau who from his long habit of writing for the  knickerbocker is always on the scent of a pun very gravely whispered in my ear that there was one beauty in the room decidedly  corned bat the fair lady need not be ashamed to  acknowledge the corn her ornament was original national and becoming and she looked handsome enough for the embodiment of the great maine institution so beautifully embalmed  in the song of hiawatha  the following is perhaps written to awe the critics since the discharge and departure of mrs woodman the gossips have had their tongues tickled by an affair  in fashionable life as it is called in which mibs  a dashing young prima donna in one of our fashionable churches appears as the party of the first part and a fashionable young man the party of the second part it seems that the gentleman had taken the small liberty as the frenchman said when he kissed his wife of making some offensive remarks touching the character and habits of the damsel aforesaid whereupon the lady louisa dresses herself for the occasion calls for a carriage picks up a female friend to see the fun and rides up and down broadway holding a neat little  rod in pickle on the look out for the offender she espied him near the  bowling green and on stepping out of the carriage proceeded to apply the cowhide to her traducer to the satisfaction of both parties the question discussed among the young mens clubs is how ought a gallant gentleman to act in a similar situation to strike back is out of the j question to run away is cowardly to seize the weapon might involve a hard struggle and

tunoriu rhodesia with thk sharpshooters by kennie stevenson the odd thing about south african war books is that although they are far too many each can plead if it does not bear in its very title a raison detre each has a public thus t  some readers the record of the long and lonesome marches of lord dunravens sharpshooters must of necessity be the most interesting book on the war yet published simply because it is concerned with themselves or their friends but even the general reader repleted as he is can turn without dismay to a book which tells its story in only 200 uncrowded pages mr stevensons aim is simply to describe thornside working of a squadron on the trek and a very amusing and touching story he makes of it the  last post sounds drearily over a comrades grave a kaffir sells a jug of beer and forgets to bring back the change out of a sovereign  camp humours canteen talk scares from hyenas and difficulties with wagons lend variety to the eternal programme described by a poetic trooper as  trekking trekking trekking always ballywell trekking from reveille until lights out our work is never done no troops we imagine have seen more of the wild and desolate life of the veldt jungles and forests of south africa than these sharpshooters one of mr stevensons most unnerving experiences was losing himself for several hours in the forest with monkeys jeering at him from the trees the sharpshooters ran all sorts of risks from wild animals sometimes a whole pack of hyenas and jackals would get on their track as many as fifty of these dangerous beasts following them mile by mile so that when a man wished to fall out three or four others remained to protect him scorpions tarantula and vermin afflicted the men in camp the task of drawing water at night from the nearest river or well was not a comfortable one in view of wildbeast amenities but the only lion with which our author actually tried conclusions he fired directly between its eyes turned out to be a pair of harmless glowworms some odd things happened one dark night when we were sitting around the fire a trader glided through the camp riding a white donkey we were all thunderstruck we thought there wasnt a white man near us for at least eighty miles one chap rather aptly expressed our feelings by crying out 4 here whats the name of that steamer   the trader never looked round but passed away into the night as mysteriously and softly as he came that story has a weird quality that we like  but indeed the whole book is a striking little record of such stern and fearless picnicing as britons love macqueen,englishfiction_contra
